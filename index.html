His mastery of rhyme, metre, imagery and mood communicate their dark, sensuous and sometimes morbid messages. Much given to melancholy and feelings of aching desolation, Tennyson&#39;s verse also carries clear messages of hope: &#39;Ring out the old, ring in the new&#39;, and &#39;Tis better to have loved and lost/Than never to have loved at all&#39;.</p><p>Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) published his first two volumes of poems in 1842, establishing him as the leading poet of his generation. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone: Illustrated Edition</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>J.K.

Like so many women artists throughout history, Frida didn&#x2019;t gain the recognition she deserved until many years after her death. When she died in 1954, the <i>New York Times</i> obituary headline read &#x201c;Frida Kahlo, Artist, Diego Rivera&#x2019;s Wife.&#x201d; This was how she was known for a long time: as the strange wife of famous muralist Diego Rivera. She&#x2019;s now considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. <br><br>Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calder�n was born just before the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution. She lived in La Casa Azul, a small house that her father painted blue. When she was six she came down with polio, which left her right leg permanently disfigured. To help it heal, her father encouraged her to exercise and play sports, but she always had a prominent limp. <br><br>Frida didn&#x2019;t plan to be an artist&#x2014;she wanted to be a doctor, and she studied medicine at one of Mexico&#x2019;s finest schools. Everything changed when she was in a bus accident at age 18. She was severely injured and spent months in a full-body cast. Isolated and in pain, she began to paint. Her mother made her an easel she could use while lying down, and her father shared his oil paints. She experimented with bright colors that reminded her of traditional Mexican folk art. The small self-portraits that she created helped her process her traumatic accident. <br><br>Frida eventually showed four of her pieces to the artist Diego Rivera, whom she adored. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got talent,&#x201d; he told her, and it was true. Her paintings were deeply personal, yet they combined elements of Mexican art, classical European painting, and newer Surrealist works. She and Diego eventually married and became part of a thriving Mexican art scene. It was a male-dominated scene but Frida also encountered women like singer Chavela Vargas, muralist Fanny Rabel, and photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo (the first and only person to exhibit Frida&#x2019;s paintings in Mexico during her lifetime). <br><br>Frida remained relatively obscure until the 1980s, when a biography about her got people&#x2019;s attention. Feminist and Latina artists began to celebrate her work, and she became a cultural icon, now more well known than Diego. Frida&#x2019;s life was painful, and she created over 140 paintings that reflected it. Unlike many other artists at the time, Frida didn&#x2019;t paint landscapes or abstract shapes: she painted her real, pained self. She celebrated her flaws, her fears, her country, and her desires and she did it beautifully.</p><h2>The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The holy grail for disillusioned cycling fans . . . The book&#x2019;s power is in the collective details, all strung together in a story that is told with such clear-eyed conviction that you never doubt its veracity. . . . <i>The Secret Race</i> isn&#x2019;t just a game changer for the Lance Armstrong myth. It&#x2019;s the game ender.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Outside</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER&nbsp;� WINNER OF THE WILLIAM HILL SPORTS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD</b><br><br><i>The Secret Race</i> is the book that rocked the world of professional cycling&#x2014;and exposed, at long last, the doping culture surrounding the sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong. Former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world&#x2019;s top-ranked cyclists&#x2014;and a member of Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s inner circle. Over the course of two years, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Daniel Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive page-turner of a book that takes us deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to win that they would do almost anything to gain an edge. For the first time, Hamilton recounts his own battle with depression and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong. This edition features a new Afterword, in which the authors reflect on the developments within the sport, and involving Armstrong, over the past year. <i>The Secret Race</i> is a courageous, groundbreaking act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>With a new Afterword by the authors</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;Loaded with bombshells and revelations.&#x201d;&#x2014;VeloNews<br><br>&#x201c;[An] often harrowing story . . . the broadest, most accessible look at cycling&#x2019;s drug problems to date.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c; &#x2018;If I cheated, how did I get away with it?&#x2019; That question, posed to <i>SI</i> by Lance Armstrong five years ago, has never been answered more definitively than it is in Tyler Hamilton&#x2019;s new book.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Sports Illustrated</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Explosive.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The Daily Telegraph </i>(London)</p><p><b>Tyler Hamilton</b> is a former professional bike racer, Olympic gold medalist, and NCAA champion. He raced professionally from 1995 to 2008 and now runs his own company, Tyler Hamilton Training LLC, in Boulder, Colorado. He lives in Missoula, Montana, with his wife, Lindsay, and his dog, Tanker.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Daniel Coyle</b> is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling<i> </i>author of <i>Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s War</i> and <i>The Talent Code</i>. He lives with his wife and four children in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and Homer, Alaska.As a bike racer, over time you develop the skill of keeping a poker face. No matter how extreme a sensation you feel&#x2014;no matter how close you are to cracking&#x2014;you do everything in your power to mask it. This matters in racing, when hiding your true condition from your opponents is a key to success, since it discourages them from attacking. Feel paralyzing pain? Look relaxed, even bored. Can&#x2019;t breathe? Close your mouth. About to die? Smile.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve got a pretty good poker face; Lance has a great one. But there&#x2019;s one guy who&#x2019;s better than either of us: Johan Bruyneel. And it was never so well used as that night at the end of the 2000 Dauphin�, when he told me about the plans for the blood transfusion. I&#x2019;d heard about transfusions before, but it was always theoretical and distant&#x2014;as in, can you believe that some guys actually bank their blood, then put it back in before a race? It seemed weird, Frankenstein- ish, something for Iron Curtain Olympic androids in the eighties. But Johan, when he explained the plan during the Dauphin�, made it sound normal, even boring. He&#x2019;s good at making the outrageous sound normal&#x2014;it might be his greatest skill. It&#x2019;s something in his expression, in the certainty of his big Belgian voice, in the supremely casual way he shrugs while laying out the details of the plan. Whenever I watch the likable gangsters on <i>The Sopranos, </i>I think of Johan.<br><br>As Johan explained it, Lance, Kevin, and I would fly to Valencia. We would donate a bag of blood, which would be stored, and we&#x2019;d fl y home the next day. Then, at a key point during the Tour, we&#x2019;d put the bag back in, and we&#x2019;d get a boost. It would be like taking EPO, except better: there were rumors of an EPO test being developed for the 2000 Olympics, and word was, they might be using the test during the Tour. I listened to Johan, nodded, gave him my poker face. When I told Haven about it, she gave me the poker face right back (wives get good at it, too). But part of me was thinking, <i>What the hell?</i><br><br>Maybe that&#x2019;s why I was late the Tuesday morning we left for Valencia. There was no reason to be late&#x2014;everybody knew Lance despised lateness above all things&#x2014;but on that crucial morning we were running late by a full ten minutes. I raced our little Fiat through the narrow streets of Villefranche; Haven was hanging on to the oh-shit bars, asking me to slow down. I kept speeding up. It was eight miles to the airport in Nice. During the trip, my cell phone rang three times. Lance.<br> <i><br>Dude, where are you?</i><br> <i>What&#x2019;s going on? We&#x2019;re about to take off.</i><br> <i>How fast can that fucking car of yours go? Come on!</i><br><br>We screeched into the airport parking lot; I walked through the security area and onto the runway. I&#x2019;d never been on a private jet before, so I took in the scene: the leather seats, the television, the little fridge, the steward asking me if I would like anything to drink.<br><br>Lance acted casual, as if private jets were routine&#x2014;which for him, they were. He&#x2019;d been riding them fairly constantly since the previous July, courtesy of Nike, Oakley, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the other corporations who were competing for the privilege of ferrying him around. The numbers were unbelievable. <i>USA Today </i>estimated Lance&#x2019;s income at $7.5 million, he was getting paid $100,000 per speech, and his new memoir, <i>It&#x2019;s Not About the Bike</i>, was an instant best seller. You could feel the flow of money, the new possibilities it opened. Now we didn&#x2019;t have to drive to Valencia. We didn&#x2019;t have to worry about customs or airport security. The jet, like everything else, was now part of our tool box.<br><br>The engines revved, the wheels went up, and we were airborne. Below, we could see the C�te d&#x2019;Azur, the mansions, the yachts; it felt surreal, like a fantasy world. In the plane, my lateness was forgiven. Lance was confident, happy, excited, and it was contagious. The confident feeling increased when we landed in Valencia and were met on the runway by the Postal team: Johan, Pepe Mart�, and del Moral. They showed up with sandwiches, <i>bocadillos</i>&#x2014;it was important to have a little something in our stomachs beforehand.<br><br>From the airport, we drove south for half an hour through a marshland as Johan and del Moral talked about the transfusion. It would be so simple, they said. So easy. Extremely safe, nothing at all to worry about. I noticed Johan talked more to Kevin and me than to Lance, and that Lance didn&#x2019;t seem to pay attention; I got the feeling this wasn&#x2019;t Lance&#x2019;s first transfusion.<br><br>We pulled up near the village of Les Gavines at a beached whale of a hotel called the Sidi Saler, luxurious and quiet, free of the tourists who&#x2019;d be arriving later in summer. We&#x2019;d already been checked in; we took the elevator up to the fifth floor, moving through the deserted hallways. Kevin and I were directed into one room facing the parking lot; Lance got his own room next door.<br><br>I had expected to see a sophisticated medical setup, but this looked more like a junior- high science experiment: a blue soft- sided cooler, a few clear plastic IV bags, cotton balls, some clear tubing, and a sleek digital scale. Del Moral took over.<br> <i><br>Lie on the bed, roll up your sleeve, give me your arm. Relax.</i><br><br>He tied a blue elastic band below my biceps, set an empty transfusion bag on a white towel on the floor next to the bed, and wiped the inside of my elbow with an alcohol swab. Then the needle. I&#x2019;d seen a lot of needles, but this one was huge&#x2014;about the size and shape of a coffee stirrer. It was attached to a syringe that was in turn attached to clear tubing that led to the waiting bag, with a small white thumb wheel to control flow. I looked away; felt the needle go in. When I looked again, my blood was pumping steadily into the bag on the floor.<br><br>You often hear &#x201c;blood transfusion&#x201d; tossed around in the same breath as &#x201c;EPO&#x201d; or &#x201c;testosterone,&#x201d; as if it&#x2019;s all equivalent. Well, it&#x2019;s not. With the other stuff, you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny injection. But here you&#x2019;re watching a big clear plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood. You never forget it.<br><br>I looked over to see Kevin hooked up in the same way. We could see our reflections on the closet-door mirror. We tried to cut the tension by comparing the speed with which our respective bags were filling: <i>Why are you going so slow? I&#x2019;m dropping you, dude. </i>Johan shuttled between the rooms, checking on us, making small talk.<br><br>Every so often Pepe or del Moral would kneel down and take the bag in their hands, tilting it gently back and forth, mixing it with anticoagulant. They were gentle because, as they explained, the red blood cells were alive. If the blood was mishandled&#x2014; shaken or heated, or left in a refrigerator beyond four weeks or so&#x2014;the cells would die.<br><br>Filling the bags took about fifteen or twenty minutes. The bags plumped up until the scale showed we were done: one pint, 500 milliliters. Then, unhook: needle out. Cotton ball, pressure. Bags taped closed, labeled, and tucked into the blue cooler. Del Moral and Pepe headed out; they didn&#x2019;t say where, but we guessed it was to the clinic in Valencia and the refrigerator there, where the bags would be stored until we needed them three weeks later at the Tour. <br></p><h2>Drawing Animals Shape by Shape: Create Cartoon Animals with Circles, Squares, Rectangles &amp; Triangles (Volume 2) (Christopher Hart Books for Kids)</h2><p>If you can draw a simple circle, square, rectangle, or triangle, you can draw any of the more than 100 cartoon animals in this fun and colorful book by Christopher Hart, the world&#x2019;s bestselling author of how-to-draw books.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. In this essay, Hall clearly sets forth the relationship of the fire symbols to the life forces within the human body. Special treatment is given to the subjects of the ductless glands and the part which they play in the development of spiritual consciousness. Mr. Hall describes how man&#39;s body is a living temple and how the places of initiation and ritual in the temple&#39;s various chambers and passageways symbolize processes occurring in the human body.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Manly P. Hall was the founder of the Philosophical Research Society. In over seventy-five years of dynamic public activity, he delivered more than 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, and authored countless books, essays, and articles. In his lectures and writings, Manly Hall always emphasized the practical aspects of philosophy and religion as they applied to daily living. He restated for modern man those spiritual and ethical doctrines which have given humanity its noblest ideals and most adequate codes of conduct. Believing that philosophy is a working tool to help the individual in building a solid foundation for his dreams and purposes, Manly Hall steadfastly sought recognition of the belief that world civilization can be perfected only when human beings meet on a common ground of intelligence, cooperation, and worthy purpose.</p><h2>Mildred Budge in Cloverdale (The Adventures of Mildred Budge)</h2><p><b>Mildred Budge couldn&#x2019;t say no for long...Oh.

His Copenhagen restaurant, Noma, was recognized as the #1 best in the world by the San Pellegrino World&#x2019;s 50 Best Restaurant awards in April 2010 after receiving the "Chef&#x2019;s Choice" award in 2009. Redzepi operates at the cutting edge of gourmet cuisine, combining an unrelenting creativity and a remarkable level of craftsmanship with an inimitable and innate knowledge of the produce of his Nordic terroir. At Noma, which Redzepi created from a derelict eighteenth&#x2010;century warehouse in 2003 after previously working at both elBulli and The French Laundry, diners are served exquisite concoctions, such as <i>Newly&#x2010;Ploughed Potato Field</i> or <i>The Snowman from Jukkasjarvi</i>, all painstakingly constructed to express their amazing array of Nordic ingredients. His search for ingredients involves foraging amongst local fields for wild produce, sourcing horse&#x2010;mussels from the Faroe Islands and the purest possible water from Greenland. Redzepi has heightened the culinary philosophy of seasonally and regionally sourced sustainable ingredients to an unprecedented level, and in doing so has created an utterly delicious cuisine. At the age of 37, Redzepi is one of the most influential chefs in the world.</p><p><i>Noma: Time and Place in Nordic Cuisine</i> offers an exclusive insight into the food, philosophy and creativity of Ren� Redzepi. It reveals the first behind the scenes look at the restaurant, Noma, and features over 90 recipes as well as excerpts from Redzepi&#x2019;s diary from the period leading up to the opening of the restaurant and texts on some the most enigmatic of Noma&#x2019;s suppliers.

Even a casual flip will reveal why Redzepi's imaginative combinations and fiercely local approach to sourcing vaulted him over stalwarts like El Bulli: sous vide reindeer shoulder served with celery root rolled in hay ashes and a wild herb gel, a whimsical meringue-based snowman atop buckthorn mousse and carrot sorbet, and a carrot cake-coated ligonberry sorbet served with hay cream are but a few of his spectacularly innovative dishes. While few home cooks will have the equipment, ingredients, or patience to attempt Musk Ox and Fresh Young Garlic or Milk Skin and Caramelized Garlic, fans of molecular gastronomy will have a field day with this ode to meticulous construction and presentation. In the end, whether Redzepi's almost ridiculously complicated dishes reveal a pretentious chef or a passionate one making the most of his ingredients doesn't matter. This is an envelope-pushing exercise that deserves respect. 200 color photos. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

He also has a dog, as you could probably guess. The dog is a Labrador-Newfoundland mix. Tom says he looks like a Labrador with a bad perm. He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults. And it's a lot more fun and rewarding to write stories for them than to write speeches for grown-ups.</p>&#x201c;This sequel to Stick Dog (2013) will have readers diving in and then begging for more adventures&#x2015;canine, feline, or otherwise.

Experimental investigations of empirical human psychology; and theoretical probability theory to interpret what our experiments tell us; and evolutionary theory to explain the conclusions. These fields give us new focusing lenses through which to view the landscape of our own minds. We have a shared vocabulary in which to describe problems and solutions. Humanity may finally be ready to synthesize the martial art of mind: to refine, share, systematize, and pass on techniques of personal rationality.When human brains try to do things, they can run into some very strange problems. Self-deception, confirmation bias, magical thinking&#x2014;it sometimes seems our ingenuity is boundless when it comes to shooting ourselves in the foot.In Map and Territory, decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky asks what a &#x201c;martial art&#x201d; of rationality would look like, beginning with the basic fighting stance&#x2014;the orientation toward the world that lets us get the most bang for our cognitive buck, that best positions us to understand and react to brains&#x2019; strange acts of self-destruction.</p><p></p><h2>The Journey</h2><p>". . . a wonderful teaching tool for those who are welcoming refugees into their community."&#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>With haunting echoes of the current refugee crisis this beautifully illustrated book explores the unimaginable decisions made as a family leave their home and everything they know to escape the turmoil and tragedy brought by war. This book will stay with you long after the last page is turned.<br><br>From the author: The Journey is actually a story about many journeys, and it began with the story of two girls I met in a refugee center in Italy. After meeting them I realized that behind their journey lay something very powerful. So I began collecting more stories of migration and interviewing many people from many different countries. A few months later, in September 2014, when I started studying a Master of Arts in Illustration at the Academy of Lucerne, I knew I wanted to create a book about these true stories. Almost every day on the news we hear the terms "migrants" and "refugees" but we rarely ever speak to or hear the personal journeys that they have had to take. This book is a collage of all those personal stories and the incredible strength of the people within them.</p><p><br>What is it like to have to leave everything behind and travel many miles to somewhere unfamiliar and strange? A mother and her two children set out on such a journey; one filled with fear of the unknown, but also great hope.<br><br>Based on her own interactions with people forced to seek a new home, and told from the perspective of a young child, Francesca Sanna has created a beautiful and sensitive book that is full of significance for our time.Francesca Sanna is an Italian illustrator and graphic designer who moved to Switzerland to follow her dream to work as an illustrator.

He tells them to make maps. He tells them to draw pictures and collect plants. Most importantly, he tells them to send presents! What kind of present is good enough for a president? Beginning readers will truly enjoy reading about this fun and little-known slice of American history.</p><p><b>Shirley Raye Redmond</b> is an author of numerous books for children, including the Step into Readings&nbsp;<i>Tentacles!

She and her husband, former Congressman Bill Redmond, have two grown children.<br><br><b>John Manders</b> has illustrated many picture books including <i>Cowboy Christmas,&nbsp;The Soldiers' Night Before Christmas</i>, and <i>The Navy's Night Before Christmas </i>for Golden Books. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Gr. 1-3. The history is handled with a light touch in this Step into Reading title about the American West, and Manders' colorful cartoon-style art is a perfect match for the storytelling. President Jefferson asks Lewis and Clark to go west, and "make maps, and explore rivers . . . collect plants and draw wild animals . . . send presents." Comic scenes show the explorers trying to catch buffalo and grizzly bears to send to the president, but they settle on the cute, little, wild dog, which scouts take back to Jefferson together with a huge load of plants, skins, and animals. Other than Sacagawea, who is a big help ("she talked and traded with the Indians they met on the way"), there's no mention of the native peoples the explorers encountered, but this lively history will make new readers want to know more. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Since Darwin's time, however, new fields of science have emerged that simply give us better answers to the question of origins. With a Ph.D. in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson is uniquely qualified to investigate what genetics reveal about origins.</p> <p><b>The Origins Puzzle Comes Together</b></p> <p>If the science surrounding origins were a puzzle, Darwin would have had fewer than 15% of the pieces to work with when he developed his theory of evolution. We now have a much greater percentage of the pieces because of modern scientific research. As Dr. Jeanson puts the new pieces together, a whole new picture emerges, giving us a testable, predictive model to explain the origin of species.</p> <p><b>A New Scientific Revolution Begins</b></p> <p>So what comes next? Darwin's theory of evolution may be one of science's longest standing, but the latest genetics research is casting doubt on it. Are these new discoveries cause to critically reexamine Darwin's theory?

Since 2009, he has been actively researching the origin of species.</p><p>Scientific knowledge often only grows when popular opinions are tested, favorite theories closely scrutinized, and comfortable concepts are challenged.

After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.</p><h2>Personal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life</h2><p><b>Machines need to be productive.

Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives.Neither a prescription nor a plan, Personal Kanban provides a light, actionable, achievable framework for understanding our work and its context. This book describes why students, parents, business leaders, major corporations, and world governments all see immediate results with Personal Kanban.</p><p>Personal Kanban is all about understanding and effectiveness. People are so busy they can&#39;t see past their daily to-dos. They let options slide by while working on tasks of little value. At any given time, we want to know what we are doing, be able to communicate that to others, and see what our true options are.

This graceful novel risks stretching beyond easy, reductive constructions of black male coming-of-age stories and delivers a sincere, authentic story of resilience and finding one's voice." -<i><b>Kirkus Reviews, </b></i><b>starred review</b><br><br>"Grimes tells a big-hearted story of Garvey...(e)mploying the Japanese poetic form of tanka&#x2014;five-line poems (or, here, stanzas) with haiku-like syllable counts&#x2014;Grimes reveals Garvey's thoughts, feelings, and observations, the spare poetry a good vehicle for a young man's attempts to articulate the puzzle that is his life." -<i><b>Horn Book Reviews</b></i></p><h2>Whole Hog BBQ: The Gospel of Carolina Barbecue with Recipes from Skylight Inn and Sam Jones BBQ [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>The definitive guide to one of the most iconic barbecue traditions&#x2014;Carolina-style chopped pork&#x2014;from the third generation pitmaster of Sam Jones BBQ and the legendary Skylight Inn,&nbsp;<b>featuring more than 20 family recipes for large-batch barbecue, sides, and desserts.</b></b><br> &nbsp;<br> In the world of barbecue, Carolina-style pork is among the most delicious and obsessed-over slow-cooked meats. Yet no one has told the definitive story of North Carolina barbecue&#x2014;until now. In <i>Whole Hog BBQ,</i> Sam Jones and Daniel Vaughn recount the history of the Skylight Inn, which opened in 1947, and share step-by-step instructions for cooking a whole hog at home&#x2014;from&nbsp;constructing a pit from concrete blocks to instructions for building a burn barrel&#x2014;along with two dozen classic family recipes including cornbread, coleslaw, spare ribs, smoked turkey, country-style steak, the signature burger, and biscuit pudding.</p><p>SAM JONES is the owner of Sam Jones BBQ and the grandson of Pete Jones, founder of the Skylight Inn in Ayden, North Carolina, which won a James Beard Award and has been open since 1947&#x2014;and which is where Sam&nbsp;started honing his chops as a boy. He returned to the family business after rediscovering barbecue through writing a 15-page essay on the topic for a college assignment. DANIEL VAUGHN is the country's first barbecue editor. He holds this post at <i>Texas Monthly</i> magazine and has also contributed to <i>Bon App�tit</i>, <i>Lucky Peach</i>, <i>First We Feast</i>, <i>Los Angeles </i>magazine, and <i>Time</i>. He is the author of <i>Prophets of Smoked Meat</i>.&#x201c;This is a new kind of book about a very old craft. A portrait of a place, a document of a cooking style, and a narrative of a family, <i>Whole Hog BBQ</i> is an honest, revealing, and generous story that sets the standard all future books on the subject will aim to meet.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;John T. Edge, author of <i>The Potlikker Papers: A Food History of the Modern South </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As someone who calls Eastern North Carolina home, the Skylight Inn has long been a source of pride for me. The Joneses are a singular voice in barbecue culture, and Sam is the family&#x2019;s whole hog, chewy cornbread, and sweet slaw evangelist. I guess that makes this book barbecue scripture!&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Vivian Howard, author of <i>Deep Run Roots </i>and star of <i>A Chef&#x2019;s Life</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>"A rare opportunity to learn the well-kept secrets of Sam and the Jones family.

Author David P. Murray comes to the defense of depressed Christians, asserting that Christians do get depressed! He explains why and how Christians should study depression, what depression is, and the approaches caregivers, pastors, and churches can take to help those who are suffering from it. With clarity and wise biblical insight, Dr. Murray offers help and hope to those suffering from depression, the family members and friends who care for them, and pastors ministering to these wounded members of their flock.<p> <b>Table of Contents: </b><br> 1.

It has helped me immensely in learning and understanding the possible causes and cures for depression/anxiety, which have grabbed my innermost being at times in my life. The practical applications and clear writing for the layman are most helpful! This book chops away at the guilt that comes from being a Christian and depressed. I highly recommend this book. It has a place on my bookshelf to be read during those dark times of depression! --D.M., Ontario, Canada<br><br>I heartily commend this new and helpful book on depression and psychiatric illness. It is the condensed result of much reading and pastoral wisdom, digested into a few non-technical chapters. It is full of Christian love for those who suffer in this way and who need our utmost compassion and tactful sympathy. I wish I had known the things written in these pages when I was a much younger minister. --Maurice Roberts<br><br>When I was first diagnosed with depression, I was completely overcome by shame. I have a wonderful husband, five adorable children, and, most importantly, I have Christ. I thought then that real Christians DON'T get depressed. Dr. Murray s book, <i>Christians Get Depressed Too</i>, was recommended to me. As I read it, I cannot express the relief and comfort I received. For a little over a year I wondered if God had abandoned me, but after reading <i>Christians Get Depressed Too</i>, my faith was greatly strengthened, and I was reassured that God has not and never will forsake me. I thank Dr. Murray for the biblical and pastoral care in his book as well as the balanced approach he takes between the all physical, all spiritual, and all mental views concerning depression. During my depression, I felt as though I was drowning in the middle of the ocean, and this book was a life preserver to me. May God continue to use this book to uplift downcast spirits and glorify His name. --Jeni L, Grand Rapids, MI</p><h2>The Complete Serger Handbook</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The most comprehensive reference on serging to date.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Craft &amp; Needlework Age</i></b><br><br> An expert teacher explains the serger, from start to finish!

All the latest studies prove that strength training, not aerobics, provides the key to losing fat and building a fit, strong body. This book refutes the misconception that women will &#34;bulk up&#34; if they lift heavy weights. Nonsense! It&#39;s tough enough for men to pack on muscle, and they have much more of the hormone necessary to build muscle: natural testosterone. Muscles need to be strengthened to achieve a lean, healthy look. Properly conditioned muscles increase metabolism and promote weight loss -- it&#39;s that simple. The program demands that women put down the &#34;Barbie&#34; weights, step away from the treadmill and begin a strength and conditioning regime for the natural athlete in every woman. The New Rules of Lifting for Women will change the way women see fitness, nutrition and their own bodies.</p><p>Lou Schuler is a National Magazine Award-winning journalist, a certified strength and conditioning specialist, the author of popular diet and strength-training books, and a dedicated blogger. He has written and edited Men&#39;s Fitness, Men&#39;s Health, Men&#39;s Health Muscle, Men&#39;s Journal, and other magazines. Alwyn Cosgrove is co-owner, with his wife Rachel, of Results Fitness in Newhall, California. He is a professional member of the National Academy of Sports Medicine and the American College of Sports Medicine, among other organizations, and is a frequent contributor to a variety of magazines, including Men&#39;s Health and Men&#39;s Fitness. Cassandra Forsythe, M.S., is a doctoral student at the University of Connecticut, studying exercise science and nutrition. She is an expert consultant for fitness and nutrition media, including Men&#39;s Health, Fitness Rx for Her, and Fitness Rx for Him.<b>Why Should a Woman Lift Like a Man?</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever watched a man working out in a gym, you can be forgiven for not immediately recognizing the bountiful lessons he has to offer. Instead, if you observed anything, it was probably one or more of these:</p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;poor form <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;overly optimistic weight selection, resulting in even poorer form <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;odd, guttural noises, usually uttered while lifting too much weight with poor form <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;a sudden inability to lift those weights after 8 to 12 repetitions (done with good or bad form), resulting in a pile of iron on the floor and an empty slot on the rack where those weights belong <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;a curious attraction to the bench press, which not only results in all of the aforementioned problems, but also is performed with a dedication and zeal that leave no time for exercises designed to work the muscles he can&#x2019;t see in a mirror <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;an even more curious lack of awareness that other people can see the muscles that don&#x2019;t show up in his mirror <br><p>So what in the world can you learn from the average meathead in your local health club? A lot. I won&#x2019;t pretend that men do anything better than women in the weight room. But I think they understand a few concepts that women tend to ignore.</p><p>These are by far the most important of all the new rules I&#x2019;ll list in this book.</p><b><p>NEW RULE #1 � The purpose of lifting weights is to build muscle</p><p>Weight-training advice for women revolves around what I call the three dirty words: toning, shaping, and sculpting. &#x201c;Tone,&#x201d; short for &#x201c;tonus,&#x201d; has a specific meaning in exercise science: it&#x2019;s the firmness of any given muscle when you aren&#x2019;t deliberately flexing it. Tonus improves when you train with weights, but it&#x2019;s not anything you can see.</p><p>The way &#x201c;toning&#x201d; is used in books and magazines catering to women, and then by women themselves, it means &#x201c;make your muscles look better without making them bigger.&#x201d; The idea is that there are specific types of workouts&#x2014;usually involving lots of repetitions with light weights&#x2014;that will help you achieve this.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not a realistic or healthy way to look at your muscles. If the weights are unchallenging, your muscles won&#x2019;t grow. If your muscles don&#x2019;t grow, they won&#x2019;t look any better than they do now, even if you could somehow strip off whatever fat sits on top of them.</p><p>This is such an important point that I&#x2019;ll repeat it:</p><p><i>With or without excess fat, your body simply will not look healthy and fit without well-trained muscle tissue. </i></p><p>&#x201c;Shaping&#x201d; offers a different but equally unlikely promise. Muscles can&#x2019;t be &#x201c;shaped.&#x201d; Their shape is determined by your genetics. You can make them bigger or smaller, and if you&#x2019;re a talented and dedicated bodybuilder you can change their size in proportion to the size of nearby muscles. In other words, you can certainly reshape your body by making some things bigger and other things smaller. But you can&#x2019;t change the shape of individual muscles.</p><p>&#x201c;Sculpting&#x201d; is the most meaningful of the three words. It implies a combination of muscle growth and fat loss that leaves the lifter&#x2019;s physique looking . . . well, <i>sculpted</i>.</p><i><p>But you can&#x2019;t &#x201c;sculpt&#x201d; muscles you haven&#x2019;t yet built.</p><b><p>NEW RULE #2 � Muscle is hard to build</p><p>When I started lifting weights, back when I was a ridiculously weak and scrawny thirteen-year-old boy who dreaded the humiliation of removing his shirt at the local swimming pool, I dreamed of having muscles roughly the size of the muscles I have now. If you had told me I&#x2019;d someday be a fairly solid 185-pounder, thanks to the weights, I would&#x2019;ve said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in!&#x201d;</p><p>But if you&#x2019;d added the caveat that it would take more than three decades to reach that size, I might&#x2019;ve had some reservations.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve never once walked into the gym thinking, &#x201c;Today I&#x2019;m going to try to not get too big.&#x201d; For most guys, when we&#x2019;re talking about muscles, there&#x2019;s no such thing as &#x201c;too big.&#x201d; Those of us who train drug-free celebrate each pound of muscle we add, and every millimeter of upper-arm girth. Some guys even obsess over the circumference of their necks. Why? Because we know that <i>it&#x2019;s really hard to put on muscle size, it never happens by accident, and every bit of it is a sign of success against all odds</i>. And that&#x2019;s with all the hormonal advantages that nature gives to men.</p><p>Meanwhile, women, naturally deprived of the amounts of testosterone that would make muscle-building a more straightforward pursuit, worry endlessly about adding so much muscle that they&#x2019;ll turn into the type of shemale you rarely encounter outside <i>The Howard Stern Show</i>.</p><p>So this brings me to the fourth dirty word: &#x201c;bulky.&#x201d; As in, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to get too bulky.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll say this as simply as I can:</p><p><i>Unless you&#x2019;re an extreme genetic outlier, you can&#x2019;t get too bulky. </i></p><p>Your body won&#x2019;t allow it. If you put on 10 pounds of muscle in Alwyn&#x2019;s six month program, you&#x2019;ll be at the top of the class. And if you don&#x2019;t take off at least 10 pounds of fat with the combination of Alwyn&#x2019;s workouts and Cassandra&#x2019;s nutrition plans, I&#x2019;ll be surprised. The most likely outcome, assuming you&#x2019;re willing to work hard, is that you&#x2019;ll come away with a small net loss in body weight, but a dramatic difference in the way your body looks in the mirror and the way your clothes fit. Your tops should be a little tighter, especially in the shoulders, and your trousers a bit roomier, particularly around the waist.</p><p>What you don&#x2019;t have to worry about is getting too big. I&#x2019;ve been lifting weights longer than many of you have been alive, and I&#x2019;m still waiting for that moment when I look in the mirror and say, &#x201c;Damn it, I&#x2019;m just too big!&#x201d;</p><p><b>NEW RULE #3 � Results come from hard work </b></p><p>This is a somewhat redundant rule, given that I mentioned hard work in the previous one. But here&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve observed over my many years of hanging around in gyms: A woman who&#x2019;s willing to work like a galley slave in Spinning class, twist herself into Gordian knots in the yoga studio, and build enough core strength with Pilates to prop up a skyscraper will walk into the weight room, pick up the pastelcolored Barbie weights, and do the exact opposite of what will give her the results she wants.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll tell a story that illustrates what I mean:</p><p>As I was writing this chapter, I observed a woman at my gym doing two exercises in combination. The first was triceps kickbacks, a simple and useless exercise in which you lean over a bench, hold your upper arm parallel to the floor, and straighten your elbow while holding a very light weight. The second was one-arm rows, in which you lean over a bench with your upper arm perpendicular to the floor, and row the weight up to the side of your abdomen.</p><p>A rowing exercise involves far more muscles, including the lats and trapezius, the big, strong muscles of the upper back. Plus, since it&#x2019;s a multijoint exercise, the muscles that bend the elbow, such as the biceps, are also involved. And in addition to all that, the leverage on a one-arm row is perfect for lifting relatively heavy weights&#x2014;you have one foot on the floor, and the opposite knee and hand braced on the bench. There&#x2019;s no stress on your lower back, and it&#x2019;s not unusual to see serious bodybuilders doing this exercise with a dumbbell weighing 100 pounds or more.</p><p>The kickback, meanwhile, is an awkward exercise, with relatively poor leverage. The only movement is at the elbow joint, which is not designed to move heavy weights at that angle. Even a beginner would probably be able to use three or four times as much weight on a row versus a kickback.</p><p>This woman was using 6-pound dumbbells for the kickbacks . . . and 7-pound weights for the rows.</p><p>I asked a trainer at the gym if he&#x2019;d seen what I&#x2019;d just seen. He shook his head sadly, and said that the toughest part of his job was getting women to use weights heavy enough to make their time in the gym worthwhile.</p><p>So even if a woman understands the first two rules in this chapter&#x2014;that the object of lifting is to build muscle, and that muscle is hard to build&#x2014;the idea that she truly needs to challenge herself in the weight room may not get through.</p><p><b>NEW RULE #4 � Hard work includes lifting heavier weights </b></p><p>It&#x2019;s not enough to progress from lifting the Barbie &#x2019;bells fifteen times to lifting them twenty times. It may be an accomplishment&#x2014;that is, the result of purposeful and exhausting work&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not going to make muscles bigger.Muscles grow for a variety of reasons, but the main one is strength. If you force them to get stronger, they will get bigger. If you start lifting 100 pounds five times, but train your body to lift 150 pounds five times, you&#x2019;re going to end up with bigger muscles. But if you start off lifting 50 pounds ten times, and progress to lifting the same 50 pounds fifteen times, all you&#x2019;ve done is increase the endurance of the muscles, which by itself will not make them bigger.</p><b><p>NEW RULE #5 � From time to time, you have to break some of the old rules</p><p>You&#x2019;ll rarely see a woman lifting weights with bad form in a gym. And you&#x2019;ll almost always see at least one man slinging iron around with technique so miserably wrong you want to dial 9 and 1 on your cell phone just to save time when the inevitable spine-buckling accident occurs.</p><p>In between the extremes, you&#x2019;ll see lots of guys pushing themselves out to the edge of acceptable form to get an extra repetition in their final set of an exercise, or to hit a new personal record on a lift. If nothing else, you&#x2019;ll probably see guys lift at a variety of speeds, perhaps shifting into a faster gear near the end of a set to help them complete more repetitions. The more experienced a male lifter is, the more he learns to trust his own body and his own instincts. (Alas, inexperienced lifters often feel the same way, even if their instincts haven&#x2019;t yet earned that trust.)</p><p>But you&#x2019;ll rarely see a woman deviate from the textbook description of the exercise. And when it comes to the tempo of her lifts, she performs them like clockwork, even if it means she has to use unchallenging weights to make such precision possible. I&#x2019;d never advocate lifting with bad form. But there&#x2019;s more to strength training than coloring inside the lines.</p><p>Part of the problem is fear. When women are introduced to the weight room, they&#x2019;re taught that there&#x2019;s only one way to perform each exercise, and that small adjustments to accommodate individual biomechanics will put her in the ER. If anybody tries to instill such fear in a man, the sound magically stops before it reaches his eardrums.</p><p>To make things worse, women are sometimes presented with cautions that have little basis in the real world, creating fear of injury when the actual risk is nonexistent.</p><p>For example, in the book <i>Body for Life for Women</i>, the author offers this instruction for a simple shoulder press: &#x201c;Press the weights up until your arms are almost straight (with your elbows just short of locked).&#x201d; Since the author is Pamela Peeke, M.D., and not some garden-variety personal trainer or celebrity who decided to expand her investment portfolio by writing a workout book, you&#x2019;d assume the antielbow- straightening precaution has a basis in science. That is, straightening your arms at the elbow joints must be bad for you.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not.</p><p>In all my years of writing about strength training, and in all my months of studying for my credentials as a trainer, I&#x2019;ve never come across any suggestion of injury risk from this simple movement. More to the point, elbows are <i>supposed </i>to lock. It&#x2019;s called &#x201c;straightening your arms.&#x201d; The triceps muscles are designed to straighten your elbows until they reach that locked position. If you don&#x2019;t lock, you don&#x2019;t work your triceps through their full range of motion, which means you don&#x2019;t get the full benefits of the elbow-straightening exercise you&#x2019;re performing.</p><p>My issue here isn&#x2019;t with the idea that people should exercise with caution, and I&#x2019;m not arguing for more reckless abandon in the weight room.What I am saying is that your body has natural movement patterns, which support a range of variations. Maybe all strength-training precautions can be reduced to these two sentences: <i>If it&#x2019;s what your body was designed to do, it&#x2019;s probably not bad form. And if the exercise requires you to do something unnatural, you should think twice before doing it. </i></p><b><p>How to Feel Like a Natural Woman</p><p>I realize that the word &#x201c;natural&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t always helpful in early twenty-first-century America, where humans spend much of the day sitting at desks or driving cars, two actions that no one would argue our bodies evolved to perform. To me, a &#x201c;natural&#x201d; position or movement is one you would assume or perform in an athletic activity.</p><p>Picture yourself playing volleyball, getting ready to return the other team&#x2019;s serve. Your feet are parallel to each other, perhaps shoulder-width apart, with toes pointed forward. Your knees are bent slightly. (You&#x2019;d never play any sport with stiff knees; you&#x2019;d be virtually immobile.) Your lower back is arched slightly. Your shoulders are square, and your midsection&#x2019;s tight. That&#x2019;s what a human body looks like when it&#x2019;s ready for physical action, whether that action is a game, a hunt, or a wrestling match.</p><p>Now picture a typical woman standing at the cable station in a typical gym, getting ready to perform triceps extensions. (In case you&#x2019;re new to lifting, the extension is an elbow-straightening exercise, usually done with a straight bar attached to the cable.) Her feet are together, her knees are locked, her lower back is flat, and her shoulders are hunched up toward her ears. In other words, she&#x2019;s in the opposite of an athletic position, despite the fact she&#x2019;s about to do an exercise that, in theory, will make her body more athletic.</p><b><p>NEW RULE #6 � No workout will make you taller</p><p>Workout advice for women is riddled with allusions to making muscles &#x201c;longer.&#x201d; I started noticing it a few years ago at the front end of the Pilates craze. In fact, I was on a panel at a conference with an editor from a women&#x2019;s magazine who, in discussing fitness trends, said that women didn&#x2019;t want to build &#x201c;bulky&#x201d; muscles; instead, they wanted &#x201c;long, lean muscles, like a dancer&#x2019;s,&#x201d; and they could get these muscles from Pilates.</p><p>I started laughing (not my most gracious moment, I admit), and wondered if I should start telling my readers at <i>Men&#x2019;s Health </i>that our workouts could make them taller. The poor woman looked stunned; I don&#x2019;t think it had occurred to her that her pro-Pilates sentiments were nothing more than propaganda.</p><p>The reality is this: muscles, as aforementioned, have a genetically predetermined shape. If you train and feed a muscle so that it grows, you can&#x2019;t choose whether the muscle becomes &#x201c;bulky&#x201d; or &#x201c;long and lean, like a dancer&#x2019;s,&#x201d; any more than you can choose your own height. I won&#x2019;t claim men are inherently reality-based&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve gotten e-mails from more than one guy asking how he can get &#x201c;ripped abs, like Brad Pitt&#x201d; (my answer: &#x201c;For starters, you&#x2019;ll need his parents&#x201d;)&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve never had anyone ask me how he can make his muscles &#x201c;longer.&#x201d; It just does...</p></b></b></b></b></i></b></p><h2>There's No Place Like Hope &#x2014; A Guide to Beating Cancer in Mind-Sized Bites</h2><p>This is Vickie Girard&#x2019;s long-awaited and completely indispensable survival guide for cancer patients and their families. Regardless of the type of cancer, here is an immediate, practical, and inspiring guide that will empower any patient to better fight and survive this disease. Through her involvement with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America and The American Cancer Society, Vickie Girard has taken her message of &#x201c;empowered patient care&#x201d; to the floor of the U.S. Senate and to thousands of cancer patients and survivors throughout the world. The message is simple, hopeful, powerful, and long overdue: &#x201c;We must stop speaking of cancer in whispers. We may have cancer, but cancer does not have us. Cancer is a beatable, treatable, survivable disease.&#x201d;</p><p>There are many books on cancer, but none so hopeful and useful as Vickie Girard&#x2019;s. The result of more than eight years of working closely with thousands of cancer patients and survivors, this is one cancer book that definitely has its feet on the ground. In the very first chapter, the author assures the reader to &#x201c;immediately throw out any old cancer horror stories. Times, treatments, and diagnoses are all changing and improving as we speak.&#x201d; The next 150 pages is a powerful, practical and inspiring guide that will empower millions of cancer patients to quickly understand the new &#x201c;Patient Empowerment Medicine&#x201d;, so they can better fight and better survive this disease. &#x201c;Fear doesn&#x2019;t defeat cancer,&#x201d; reminds Girard, &#x201c;empowered treatment defeats cancer.&#x201d; Having survived one of the most deadly types of cancer, she writes with unusual clarity and authority and has taken her message to the floor of the United States Senate and to thousands of cancer patients and su! rvivors throughout the world. Her personal mission is to &#x201c;empower and inspire people who have cancer and those who love them,&#x201d; and her long-awaited book truly delivers on that promise.In all my years of counseling cancer patients, I never found the one book that patients and their families were always requesting. I finally gave up looking and decided to write it. I come with vital information to share with cancer patients at any stage of your battle, regardless of the type of cancer you are dealing with. I write to tell you that, yes, I have been down the road and I&#x2019;ve come back to tell you that, if you look closely, there are bread crumbs along the path to guide you in defeating your cancer. I want to assure you that even the worst of odds can be beaten and overcome---that the hope of defeating cancer now exists for us all. There is no such thing as &#x201c;false hope.&#x201d; The day my hope was fed is the day I began to get well. Even when it is not probable, it is still possible to win against this disease. I am living proof of this. Remember that cancer does not have a brain, a heart, or a spirit. It is you who has the brain, the ability to s! trategize and to plan the cancer&#x2019;s demise. So keep your pilot light burning brightly, read this book, get ready to fight, and know that I&#x2019;m with you all the way.</p><h2>Conquering the Physics GRE</h2><p>The Physics GRE plays a significant role in deciding admissions to nearly all US physics Ph.D. programs, yet few exam-prep books focus on the test&#39;s actual content and unique structure.

In the most basic sense, all of us are vulnerable; to be human is to be susceptible to misfortune, violence, illness, and death. The role of government, however, is to offer forms of protection that enhance our lives and shield our bodies from foreseeable and preventable dangers. Unfortunately, for many citizens&#x2014;particularly those marked as poor, Black, Brown, immigrant, queer, or trans&#x2014;State power has only increased their vulnerability, making their lives more rather than less unsafe.<br> <br>To be Nobody is to be subject to State violence. In recent years, thousands of Americans have died at the hands of law enforcement, a reality made even more shameful when we consider how many of these victims were young, poor, mentally ill, Black, or unarmed. The cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York City; Kathryn Johnston in Atlanta; Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; and Sandra Bland in Hempstead, Texas, have forced a stubborn nation to come to terms with the realities of police corruption, brutality, and deeply entrenched racism. While media coverage and global activism have turned these individuals into household names, they are not, sadly, exceptional. Instead, they represent the countless Americans who die daily, and unnecessarily, at the hands of those who are paid to protect and serve them.<br> <br>To be Nobody is to also confront systemic forms of State violence. Long before he was standing in front of the barrel of Darren Wilson&#x2019;s gun, Michael Brown was the victim of broken schools and evaporated labor markets. Prior to being choked to death by Daniel Pantaleo, Eric Garner lived in a community terrorized by policing practices that transform neighborhoods into occupied territories and citizens into enemy combatants. Sandra Bland&#x2019;s tragic death sequence did not begin with a negligent jailer or an unreasonable cop but with a criminal justice system that has consistently neglected the emotional, physical, and psychological well-being of Black women and girls. For the vulnerable, it is the violence of the ordinary, the terrorism of the quotidian, the injustice of the everyday, that produces the most profound and intractable social misery.<br> <br>To be Nobody is to be abandoned by the State. For decades now, we have witnessed a radical transformation in the role and function of government in America. An obsession with free-market logic and culture has led the political class to craft policies that promote private interests over the public good. As a result, our schools, our criminal justice system, our military, our police departments, our public policy, and virtually every other entity engineered to protect life and enhance prosperity have been at least partially relocated to the private sector. At the same time, the private sector has kept its natural commitment to maximizing profits rather than investing in people. This arrangement has left the nation&#x2019;s vulnerable wedged between the Scylla of negligent government and the Charybdis of corporate greed, trapped in a historically unprecedented state of precarity.<br> <br>To be Nobody is to be considered disposable. In New Orleans, we saw the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina followed by a grossly unnatural government response, one that killed thousands of vulnerable citizens and consigned many more to refugee status. In Flint, Michigan, we are witnessing this young century&#x2019;s most profound illustration of civic evil, an entire city collectively punished with lead-poisoned water for the crime of being poor, Black, and politically disempowered. Every day, the nation&#x2019;s homeless, mentally ill, drug addicted, and poor are pushed out of institutions of support and relocated to jails and prisons. These conditions reflect a prevailing belief that the vulnerable are unworthy of investment, protection, or even the most fundamental provisions of the social contract. As a result, they can be erased, abandoned, and even left to die.<br> <br>Without question, Nobodyness is largely indebted to race, as White supremacy is foundational to the American democratic experiment. The belief that White lives are worth more than others&#x2014;what Princeton University scholar Eddie Glaude calls the &#x201c;value gap&#x201d;&#x2014;continues to color every aspect of our public and private lives.1 This belief likewise compromises the lives of vulnerable White citizens, many of whom support political movements and policies that close ranks around Whiteness rather than ones that enhance their own social and economic interests.<br> <br>While Nobodyness is strongly tethered to race, it cannot be divorced from other forms of social injustice. Instead, it must be understood through the lens of &#x201c;intersectionality,&#x201d; the ways that multiple forms of oppression operate simultaneously against the vulnerable.2 It would be impossible to examine the 2015 killing of Mya Hall by National Security Agency police without understanding how sexism and transphobia conspire with structural racism to endanger Black trans bodies. We cannot make sense of Sandra Bland&#x2019;s tragic death without recognizing the impact of gender and poverty in shaping the current carceral state. To understand the complexity of oppression, we must avoid simple solutions and singular answers.<br> <br>Despite the centrality of race within American life, Nobodyness cannot be understood without an equally thorough analysis of class. Unlike other forms of difference, class creates the material conditions and relations through which racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression are produced, sustained, and lived. This does not mean that all forms of injustice are due to class antagonism, nor does it mean that all forms of domination can be automatically fixed through universal class struggle. Rather, it means that we cannot begin to address the various forms of oppression experienced by America&#x2019;s vulnerable without radically changing a system that defends class at all costs.<br> <br>This book is my attempt to tell the stories of those marked as Nobody. Based on extensive research, as well as my time on the ground&#x2014;in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, Atlanta, Hempstead, Flint, and Sanford&#x2014;I want to show how the high-profile and controversial cases of State violence that we&#x2019;ve witnessed over the past few years are but a symptom of a deeper American problem. Underneath each case is a more fundamental set of economic conditions, political arrangements, and power relations that transforms everyday citizens into casualties of an increasingly intense war on the vulnerable. It is my hope that this book offers an analysis that spotlights the humanity of these &#x201c;Nobodies&#x201d; and inspires principled action.</p><h2>52 Boxes in 52 Weeks: Improve Your Design Skills One Box At A Time</h2><p><p><strong>What do you get when an accomplished woodworker and senior editor of<em> Fine Woodworking</em> magazine sets himself the challenge of designing and building one box a week for a solid year?

Otherwise, you&#x2019;ll get more than a glimpse of what is to come . . .<br> <br>To any reader of the Dark Tower series, Roland Deschain is an instantly recognizable character. As I write this, I see him in my mind&#x2019;s eye, striding across the yellowing grasses of the River Barony savannah, his black hair threaded with gray, his body tall and lanky, his holster and gun belt strapped to his hips. Only one of those fabled sandalwood-handled six-shooters is with him; it rests against his left thigh. The other is back at camp, secure in the docker&#x2019;s clutch strapped to Eddie Dean&#x2019;s side. As I stare, Roland turns his head and regards me pragmatically. If you need to talk to me, he says, then come. Time may be a face on the water, but in Roland&#x2019;s world, water is scarce.<br> <br>Roland watches as I pass through the doorway of the page. His pale blue eyes really are like those of a bombardier, both cool and assessing. By necessity, this meeting will be brief. I&#x2019;m another one of Roland&#x2019;s secrets, and he thinks it better to keep me that way. He&#x2019;s not certain what level of the Tower I come from, but he knows one thing. I am mapping his travels.<br> <br>Finding some shade, Roland hunkers. I hand him one of the rolling papers I&#x2019;ve brought, and he accepts it silently. Unlacing the leather thongs of his traveling purse, he removes his tobacco poke and rolls a smoke. Despite the missing fingers on his right hand, he works the paper dexterously, licking the gummed side with a grimace. He strikes a match against the seam of his jeans and lights his cigarette. For a moment his face is illuminated with an eerie glow that makes his features look drawn and more than a little haggard. He has a few days&#x2019; worth of stubble on his cheeks, and his lips are chapped. Once again I try to show him this concordance, but he waves the bound manuscript away as he exhales a cloud of smoke. As always, he thinks that my constant revisions waste paper. Besides, he&#x2019;s only interested in the maps. But today I&#x2019;ve brought a short piece, and this he has agreed to hear. It&#x2019;s my interpretation of his epic journey. Taking another deep drag, Roland rolls his hand in that gesture which means only one thing, in any world. Get on with it. So I clear my throat and (rather nervously) begin.<br> ROLAND, THE TOWER, AND THE QUEST<p></p> <br>Roland Deschain is Mid-World&#x2019;s final gunslinger. Like a knight from the Arthurian legends of our world, Roland is on a quest. His &#x201c;grail&#x201d; is the Dark Tower, the linchpin of the time/space continuum, and his goal is to climb to its very top and question the god or demon who resides there. Roland&#x2019;s world is unraveling. The Beams that maintain the proper alignment of time, space, size and dimension are breaking down and the Tower itself is foundering. This structural instability affects all worlds, but in Roland&#x2019;s, the symptoms are dramatic. As the fabric of reality wears away, thinnies form and spread. These squalling mist bogs swallow all those that stumble into them, letting their captives fall into the dark no-places between worlds. As the landscape stretches, directions drift. What is west today may be southwest tomorrow and southeast the day after. A goal that lay only fifty miles away can suddenly become a hundred, or even a thousand, miles distant.<br> <br>As the direct descendant of Arthur Eld, King of All-World-that-was, and as Mid-World&#x2019;s last dinh, Roland must rescue his land from annihilation. But his task is gargantuan. He must find a way to safeguard the framework, the loom, upon which the interpenetrating realities are woven. But to do so&#x2014;in order to shore up that central Tower and the Beams which radiate out from it&#x2014;he must find his way across a landscape so fragmented that neither map nor memory can help him pinpoint his destination. In fact, Roland does not even know where the Tower stands. He realizes that he must head toward a place called End-World, but where does that land lie? How can he find it? During the early stages of his journey, Roland the warrior chooses the path of the ascetic. Believing he can only reach his goal as a solitary traveler, he sacrifices all human relationships, even when it means betrayal, because he thinks such sacrifice will speed him along his way. Comrades and lovers are left behind like abandoned water skins.<br> <br>Roland believes that to climb the Tower he must have no ties holding him to Mid-World. He must be isolated, self-sufficient, cut off from the nurturing tides of relationship. Thinking in terms of conquest and battle, Roland follows the duplicitous Walter across the deserts of Mid-World, believing that this enemy will eventually lead him to his goal. Similarly, as a boy, he followed the path set for him by Maerlyn&#x2019;s Grapefruit, a magic ball whose evil, distorting visions tricked him into first sacrificing his lover, Susan Delgado, and then murdering his own mother.<br> <br>What Roland doesn&#x2019;t at first realize is that, like any young knight, he is being tested. The initial path he chooses is a false start, no more than a glammer thrown by the enemies who want to thwart him. What their treachery exposes is that the young Roland is driven by ambition, personal glory, and revenge as much as he is by a desire to fulfill his destiny as the last warrior of the White. By tempting him to betray all that a knight should hold sacred, Roland&#x2019;s enemies ensure that Roland will repeat the mistakes of his fathers and either abandon his quest as hopeless or become lost in the deserts and golgothas of Mid-World which, in the end, but mirror the dry wreckage of his heart.<br> <br>Roland, the young warrior, does not understand the ultimate nature of his quest. He does not realize that, as the trickster Walter says in the golgotha, he already stands so close to the Tower that worlds turn about his head.4 Because of his own preconceptions, his inherited worldview, he does not understand that his fate, and the fate of Mid-World, are one and the same.<br> <br>Roland&#x2019;s story is not just an adventure tale; it is one with symbolic meaning. His pilgrimage is intrinsically linked to a legend from our world, a legend which was an important influence upon the Modernists and which formed the basis for a famous poem by T. S. Eliot. That legend is the story of the Waste Land. In its incarnation in the Dark Tower series, this legend is bound to another belief, one that dates back to the time when men and women thought that their kings and queens were appointed by God. According to this worldview, the body of the king is the body of the land, and the well-being of one is indivisible from the well-being of the other. If the king is sick, in body or in mind, then the land falls to ruin. To cure the land, you must first cure the king. The one will only flourish if the other is in balance.<br> <br>As above, so below. The disease of the larger is the same as that of the smaller, and they both progress according to the same principle. To understand what dries and devastates the land, what threatens the very fabric of the universe and the stability of the interpenetrating worlds, one must also understand what ails the king. All are affected by the same illness, but to cure this illness we must discover its underlying cause. And this is the true purpose of Roland&#x2019;s journey.<br> <br>We all know that as the Beams snap, the Tower falters. But what is its equivalent on the human plane? What malaise weakens the bonds of Mid-World&#x2019;s culture? What disease affects Roland, the foremost representative of his fragmenting world?<br> <br>High Speech, the tongue of gunslingers, is a subtle and complex language. Its words are difficult to define because they are so full of nuance. Each word has multiple meanings which refer, simultaneously, to ordinary human interaction, to the web that joins the interacting individuals, and to the greater pattern of humanity&#x2019;s past and future movements. No human interaction, then, is meaningless. They all reflect both individual and cultural ka.<br> <br>Ka, we know, resembles a wheel. In fact, it looks much like the wheel Roland draws in The Waste Lands, a wheel meant to represent the Tower, the Beams, and the Portals in and out of Mid-World. In Roland&#x2019;s map, the hub of the wheel is the Tower, the spokes are the Beams, and the rivets are the Guardians, who are the Portals&#x2019; sentries. Some Guardians, like the Turtle, are protective, while others, like the Bear Guardian Shardik, are downright dangerous. But they all serve the Beams, the Beams serve the Tower, and the Tower is what keeps the universe united. And perhaps these Beams work like Batteries, with positive and negative charges, the one balancing the other. That would explain why the Turtle is kind and the Bear&#x2014;the opposite end of the Beam&#x2014;is negative. Even polarity has its place, like light and darkness. That is, as long as the whole remains in balance.<br> <br>Although it would be difficult to map the wheel of ka in this way&#x2014;it is much too big&#x2014;we can, at least, map the forces of ka-tet, remembering that the small is a miniature of the larger. As dinh of his ka-tet and as dinh of Mid-World, Roland sits at the center of the wheel. The Guardians of his present ka-tet are his companions Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy. The sorcerer Walter&#x2014;who plays a large part in the drawing and binding of this ka-tet&#x2014;can also be placed as one of the Guardians, though his polarity is negative.<br> <br>Just as there is a word for the pattern of ka-tet, there is a word for the bonds (or Beams) that hold the tet together. This word is khef. Like almost all the words of High Speech, khef has multiple meanings, including birth and life force, but perhaps the most ubiquitous of these meanings is also the simplest. And that meaning is water.<br> <br>As Roland knows all too well from his journey in the Mohaine Desert, a human will die much sooner from dehydration than he will from lack of food. The same can be said about the land, about society, and about the individual soul. Once again, the patterns and forces remain the same; what changes are the superficial forms. Khef can be literal water, the essence of life, but it can also mean emotion, the essence and bond of relationship. Whether this bond is one of loyalty or hatred, it always binds. That is, as long as the forces of the positive and the negative remain in dynamic balance. A certain amount of conflict is necessary for growth and change, but too much of the negative&#x2014;too much repellent&#x2014;and the ka-tet ceases to exist.<br> <br>The patterns of ka-tet can be used to describe the subtle interactions which hold a society together. Without these emotional interactions, which create dynamic and forceful cohesion, society devolves and disintegrates; it becomes a mass of warring individuals, or warring clans. The beneficial interconnectedness of the whole is lost.<br> <br>The bonds of khef are reciprocal. Both parties must contribute or else the connection is at best unstable, at worst illusory. Each side must give of itself. The unity of ka-tet depends on the forces of khef. In order for the ka-tet to survive, the Guardians of ka-tet must remain true, but their loyalty depends, in turn, upon the truth and honesty of the center. When the center does not hold true, the fabric begins to unravel, and this is exactly what has happened to Roland&#x2019;s world, and what has, in turn, happened over and over in Roland&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>Ka is a wheel; its one purpose is to turn. The spin of ka always brings us back to the same place, to face and reface our mistakes and defeats until we can learn from them.5 When we learn from the past, the wheel continues to move forward, toward growth and evolution. When we don&#x2019;t, the wheel spins backward, and we are given another chance. If once more we squander the opportunity, the wheel continues its rotation toward devolution, or destruction. While the High Speech terms for life and relationship have multiple meanings and subtle nuances, char, the Tongue&#x2019;s word for Death, has no other meaning. Char is bleak and final. The wheel continues to turn, but we are forcefully removed from it. Since we each have a place in the greater pattern, breaking of khef rends the fabric of the All.<br> <br>What can be said of individuals can also be said of societies, and Roland&#x2019;s society is no exception. Although Mid-World enjoyed periods of stability, its history remains predominantly a story of sacrifice and bloodshed. Although High Speech shows that unity and relationship were valued, in the everyday of life they were, more often than not, forgotten. Many of Mid-World&#x2019;s sins were sins against khef, the bonding force of ka and culture. In Mid-World-that-was, the balance between positive and negative was lost; creating and maintaining khef became less important than the propagation of char. Just as the Beams began to weaken, the khef which was meant to unite began to repel. The waters of life withdrew, and Mid-World became a desert. The result? Fragmentation and dehydration on all levels of reality, and on all levels of the Tower.<br> <br>In &#x201c;The Little Sisters of Eluria,&#x201d; Roland says that the religions of his world taught that &#x201c;love and murder were inextricably bound together&#x2014;that in the end, God always drank blood.&#x201d;6 Upon intensive scrutiny, Roland&#x2019;s statement certainly seems to hold true. The Druits, the most ancient of Mid-World&#x2019;s people, raised the stones of the Speaking Rings in order to have temples devoted to human sacrifice. Although these practices may have drawn some of the people together, giving them a sense of unity and strength, they would have also created a blood-debt to the victim, and the victim&#x2019;s ka-tet, rending the fabric of the All. Even at this early stage of Mid-World&#x2019;s cultural evolution, the negative energy released by these acts began to thin reality. The forces of char became more powerful and the forces of khef were weakened. Within these circles doorways formed, but the sentries of these lesser portals were demons, not Guardians.<br> <br>Although technologically advanced, the later generations of Mid-World gave little more thought to the forces of khef, or life-water, than their ancestors. The Great Old Ones created computerized wonders, such as Blaine, and accomplished amazing engineering and architectural feats, such as the building of Lud and the laying of the train lines deep below the Cyclopean Mountains, but even these seemingly &#x201c;good&#x201d; things were eventually tainted by the death-drive of their makers. Blaine developed a psychotic personality and drove the people of Lud on to Mid-World&#x2019;s oldest practice&#x2014;human sacrifice. The city of Lud, once the gem of the Imperium, fell into the hands of diseased and warring gangs, and the train lines of the mountains seethed with Slow Mutants, those terrible creatures who were once human but who had been completely mutated by the Old Ones&#x2019; poisons. No matter what grand plan they had for the future of the interpenetrating universes, the Old Ones worshiped the gods of char, the gods of destruction. The Old Ones&#x2019; technological wizardry was focused on one endpoint, and that endpoint was the creation of more and more dangerous weapons. In this they succeeded. In fact, they succeeded so completely that they wiped out their own civilization and transformed Mid-World into a poisoned, desiccated wasteland.<br> <br>As Susan Delgado says to Roland when they stand, horrified, by a line of resurrected war tankers, the ways of the Great Old Ones were the ways of death.7 But over the course of the series we lear...</p><h2>Let&#39;s Get Pickled!

George G. Hunter III points out that while the attention paid to the Celtic Christians is well deserved, much of it fails to recognize the true genius of this ancient form of Christianity. What many contemporary Christians do not realize is that Celtic Christianity was one of the most successfully evangelistic branches of the church in history. The Celtic church converted Ireland from paganism to Christianity in a remarkably short period, and then proceeded to send missionaries throughout Europe.<br> <br> North America is today in the same situation as the environment in which the early Celtic preachers found their mission fields: unfamiliar with the Christian message, yet spiritually seeking and open to a vibrant new faith. If we are to spread the gospel in this culture of secular seekers, we would do well to learn from the Celts. Their ability to work with the beliefs of those they evangelized, to adapt worship and church life to the indigenous patterns they encountered, remains unparalleled in Christian history. If we are to succeed in reaching the West . . . again, then we must begin by learning from these powerful witnesses to the saving love of Jesus Christ.<br> <br> This classic book on the power of indigenous evangelism has been thoroughly revised and updated, proving once again how much these ancient Christians have to teach anyone who seeks to spread the word of the gospel.</p><p>George G. Hunter III is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Asbury Theological Seminary&#x2019;s School of World Mission and Evangelism, where he served as Dean for 18 years and Distinguished Professor for 10 years. He served as the founding dean of Asbury's E. Stanley Jones School of World Mission and Evangelism.

He has written over a dozen books, including <em>How To Reach Secular People</em>, <em>Church for the Unchurched</em>, <em>The Celtic Way of Evangelism</em>, <em>Leading &amp; Managing a Growing Church</em>, <em>Radical Outreach: The Recovery of Apostolic Ministry</em><em> and Evangelism</em>, <em>Christian, Evangelical and . . .

Chris lives with his wife, Jay, in Devon, England, where they are at work on his next book.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;This book expands on the dragon lore created in <i>The Fire Within</i> (Scholastic, 2005). College student David Rain's new professor, Dr. Bergstrom, a polar research scientist, introduces him to legends from the Arctic and invites him to write an essay about dragons to qualify for a research trip. A succession of paranormal events leads to David's flamboyant classmate Zanna inadvertently quickening a dragon egg belonging to his landlady, Liz. A powerful woman who calls herself Gwyneth, and who claims to be Liz's aunt, arrives to help with the arrival of the new dragon. David discovers that Gwyneth is a figure from dragon legends, and that her motivations may lead to harm for him and for his friends. His attempts to oppose her result in an action-packed conclusion, expanding further on the legends and leaving room for the final volume in the series. In contrast to the domestic story of <i>The Fire Within</i>, <i>Icefire</i> offers a darker and more mature story. Liz's clay dragons develop a greater degree of realism within the story, and their background is further explored. Readers will find action and mysteries aplenty in this fantastic tale, as well as a group of appealing dragons who are tricky, heroic, and often charming.<i>&#x2013;Beth L.

He argued instead that the reality or substance of things lies in their concrete forms, and in so doing he probed some of the deepest questions of philosophy: What is existence? How is change possible? And are there certain things that must exist for anything else to exist at all? The seminal notions discussed in <i>The Metaphysics</i> - of 'substance' and associated concepts of matter and form, essence and accident, potentiality and actuality - have had a profound and enduring influence, and laid the foundations for one of the central branches of Western philosophy. <br><br>In this edition Hugh Lawson-Tancred's lucid translation is accompanied by a stimulating introduction in which he highlights the central themes of one of philosophy's supreme masterpieces.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

For twenty years he studied at Athens at the Academy of Plato, on whose death in 347 he left, and some time later became tutor to Alexander the Great.

After Alexander's death he was driven out of Athens and fled to Chalcis in Euboea where he died in 322.

Visit Lauren online at laurenkatenovels.com.<p>Lilith woke up coughing.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was wildfire season--it was always wildfire season--and her lungs were thick with smoke and ash from the red blaze in the hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her bedside clock flashed midnight, but her thin white curtains glowed gray with dawn. The power must be out again. She thought of the biology test awaiting her in fourth period, followed immediately by the sucky fact that last night she&#x2019;d brought home her American history book by mistake. Whose idea of a cruel joke was it to assign her two textbooks with precisely the same color spine? She was going to have to wing the test and pray for a C.<br> &nbsp;<br> She slid out of bed and stepped in something warm and soft. She drew her foot up, and the smell assaulted her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Alastor!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The little blond mutt trotted into her bedroom, thinking Lilith wanted to play. Her mom called the dog a genius because of the tricks Lilith&#x2019;s brother, Bruce, had taught him, but Alastor was four years old and refused to learn the only trick that mattered: being housebroken.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is seriously uncivilized,&#x201d; she scolded the dog, and hopped on one foot into the bathroom. She turned on the shower.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Water off till 3 p.m. her mom&#x2019;s note proclaimed on a sheet of loose-leaf taped to the bathroom mirror. The tree roots outside were curling through their pipes, and her mom was supposed to have money to pay the plumber this afternoon, after she got a paycheck from one of her many part-time jobs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lilith groped for toilet paper, hoping at least to wipe her foot clean. She found only a brown cardboard tube. Just another Tuesday. The details varied, but every day of Lilith&#x2019;s life was more or less the same degree of awful.<br> &nbsp;<br> She tore her mom&#x2019;s note from the mirror and used it to wipe her foot, then dressed in black jeans and a thin black T-shirt, not looking at her reflection. She tried to remember a single shred of what her biology teacher had said might be on the test.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time she got downstairs, Bruce was tilting the remains of the cereal box into his mouth. Lilith knew those stale flakes were the last morsels of food in the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re out of milk,&#x201d; Bruce said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And cereal?&#x201d; Lilith said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And cereal. And everything.&#x201d; Bruce was eleven and nearly as tall as Lilith, but much slighter. He was sick. He had always been sick. He was born too soon, with a heart that couldn&#x2019;t keep up with his soul, Lilith&#x2019;s mother liked to say. Bruce&#x2019;s eyes were sunken and his skin had a bluish tint because his lungs could never get enough air. When the hills were on fire, like they were every day, he wheezed at the smallest exertion. He stayed home in bed more often than he went to school.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lilith knew Bruce needed breakfast more than she did, but her stomach still growled in protest. Food, water, basic hygiene products--everything was scarce in the dilapidated dump they called home.<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced through the grimy kitchen window and saw her bus pulling away from the stop. She groaned, grabbing her guitar case and her backpack, making sure her black journal was inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Later, Bruce,&#x201d; she called, and took off.<br> &nbsp;<br> Horns blared and tires squealed as Lilith sprinted across the street without looking, like she always told Bruce not to do. Despite her terrible luck, she never worried about dying. Death would mean freedom from the panicked hamster wheel of her life, and Lilith knew she wasn&#x2019;t that lucky. The universe or God or something wanted to keep her miserable.<br> &nbsp;<br> She watched the bus rumble off, and then started walking the three miles to school with her guitar case bouncing against her back. She hurried across her street, past the strip mall with the dollar store and the drive-through Chinese place that was always going in and out of business. Once she got a few blocks beyond her own gritty neighborhood, known around town as the Slump, the sidewalks smoothed out and the roads had fewer potholes. The people who stepped outside to get their papers were wearing business suits, not the ratty bathrobes Lilith&#x2019;s neighbors often wore. A well-coiffed woman walking her Great Dane waved good morning, but Lilith didn&#x2019;t have time for pleasantries. She ducked through the concrete pedestrian tunnel that ran beneath the highway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Trumbull Preparatory School sat at the corner of High Meadow Road and Highway 2--which Lilith mostly associated with stressful trips to the emergency room when Bruce got really sick. Speeding down the pavement in her mother&#x2019;s purple minivan, her brother wheezing faintly against her shoulder, Lilith always gazed out the window at the green signs on the side of the highway, marking the miles to other cities. Even though she hadn&#x2019;t seen much--anything--outside of Crossroads, Lilith liked to imagine the great, wide world beyond it. She liked to think that someday, if she ever graduated, she&#x2019;d escape to a better place.<br> &nbsp;<br> The late bell was ringing when she emerged from the tunnel near the edge of campus.

It was generally held that to improve the nation&#x2019;s health, all we had to do was make the existing health care more widely available.</p><p>It soon became painfully evident that more health care did not always lead to more health. In fact, the rapid advances of medical science seemed to be increasingly overpowered by the well-marketed culture of unhealthy consumption.</p><p>By the early 1980s, this alarming trend found many doctors seeking new ways to heal harmful habits. Twenty years ago, through my private practice and my work as a founding member of the American Holistic Medical Association, I was fortunate enough to become involved with the incredibly effective work of Julia Ross. Most of the patients with overeating and weight problems whom I sent to her clinic received major benefit. Eventually, I was so impressed that I signed on as their backup physician.</p><p>I am delighted that her unique approach, now in an updated edition, will be even more accessible. May it help guide you in your efforts toward greater health and well-being.</p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S CAUTIONARY NOTE</p><p>If you have a known or suspected medical condition, are taking medication of any kind, or have specific health concerns, you should consult a qualified health care provider before following any of the suggestions in this book.

It has been a marvel from the start:</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minute the book proposal hit the publishing houses, I began to get calls at my clinic from editors and publishers asking for personal help. When I came to New York, more publishers wanted to meet with me than with any other author my seasoned NYC agent had ever represented. Then there was a bidding frenzy. Why? Because the word was all over Manhattan that a truly new approach to the &#x201c;weight problem&#x201d; had arrived&#x2014;the first since Atkins in 1972.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After publication, grateful readers&#x2019; reviews began to flood in. Out of dozens of similar postings, this is my favorite: &#x201c;The chocolate cravings are gone! The ice cream cravings are gone! Refined carbs are not a part of my life anymore and I don&#x2019;t miss them. 6 weeks on <i>The Diet Cure</i> and I am down at least a size in clothing and I feel better than I ever have (EVER).&#x201d; And twelve years later, they keep on coming.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Diet Cure</i> keeps on selling&#x2014;in both the United States and abroad. Take France, where, although obesity is relatively new, Parisian food writer Julien Tort had been struggling with it since childhood. One day, exploring American weight loss methods on the Internet, he discovered low-carb dieting. (This is big news in France, if you can imagine.) He went on Atkins and lost weight easily. He was thrilled. Until his willpower ran out and he reverted to pasta and bread. Back on the Internet he found <i>The Diet Cure</i>. Since then, he&#x2019;s lost seventy pounds, translated the book, and arranged its 2011 French publication.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people buy multiple copies of <i>The Diet Cure</i> to give to friends and family. While I was at a spa celebrating a recent birthday, the masseuse started talking about a book she said had saved her life. She&#x2019;d had cancer and had been treated, but could not stick to the cancer-recovery diet because her sugar cravings were so strong. (Sugar is the favorite food of cancer cells.) &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m four years sugar-free and six years cancer-free.&#x201d; When, intrigued, I asked her the name of the book&#x2019;s author, and then told her my name, the room became a screaming love fest, and she told me that she&#x2019;d given away fifty copies of <i>The Diet Cure</i> as gifts.</p><p></p><p>More than ever before we need this gift: freedom from the unprecedented, diet-related plagues of the twenty-first century. <i>The Diet Cure</i> came out just before the first stunning reports of the obesity epidemic among adults, and then children, were released. Since then, this phenomenon has escalated to the point that even infant obesity has become a significant problem. The incidence of heart disease, kidney failure, and increased cancer risk has also skyrocketed, along with type 2 diabetes among both adults and children.</p><p>Why did things suddenly go so wrong? Because weight- and blood-sugar-destabilizing foods are much more plentiful in our diets now, and they are much harder to resist. Thanks to new research worldwide, and to former FDA chief David Kessler&#x2019;s 2010 expos�, we now know that the food industry&#x2019;s efforts to make its products more &#x201c;palatable&#x201d; have succeeded beyond even its wildest dreams. We&#x2019;re now officially a nation of food addicts, beyond the help of willpower or <i>any</i> diet. Our only hope is to locate a manual for dismantling that addiction. <i>The Diet Cure</i> is that manual.</p><p>So why a new edition? Since the book was first published, our clinic has worked with more than two thousand newly diagnosed overeaters. In the process, we have developed even better methods of correcting the biochemical imbalances that propel us into food addiction. My publisher and I agreed that it was time to send out a new lifeline&#x2014;an even stronger edition of <i>The Diet Cure</i> that would include all of the clinical advances we&#x2019;ve made and the research backing them up. To accomplish this, I have updated and streamlined almost half of the book&#x2014;extreme measures for extreme times.</p><p>A few examples:</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#x2019;ve learned more about how to correct deficits in our brain&#x2019;s appetite chemistry, in our ability to handle stress, and in our sex hormone balance&#x2014;three well-established triggers of the compulsion to overeat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most potent methods for eliminating afternoon, evening, and winter food cravings has only recently become available in the United States. We have it for you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know better how to test for and treat low thyroid function to improve metabolism and calorie burning.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With diabetes now epidemic, we&#x2019;ve found solid clinical research confirming our experience that saturated fat is safe, healthful, and the best blood sugar regulator of all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Eating Plan has been completely reorganized and updated and includes a vital reevaluation of the facts on red meat, cholesterol, and vegetarianism.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new nutrient supplement protocols, new lab tests, new books and CDs to recommend, new ways to find effective holistic practitioners, and more.</p><p></p><p>To all of you who have already read <i>The Diet Cure</i>: Trust me when I urge you to invest in this new edition. I&#x2019;ve seen your dog-eared copies at my lectures and that many of you have even color-indexed them. But I promise that you will find treasures in the material I&#x2019;ve added. (And I&#x2019;m a better writer now, too!)</p><p>I wish you a successful escape from our twenty-first-century dietary disaster. Everything you&#x2019;ll need is packed and ready for you here in the new <i>Diet Cure</i>.</p><p>My best wishes to all of you!</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>8 Steps to <br>the Diet Cure</p><p>This is not going to be like any diet book you have ever read. I won&#x2019;t mention calories except to forbid you to eat too <i>few</i>! I won&#x2019;t tell you to tune in to your &#x201c;real&#x201d; appetite because I know that if you could have you would have long ago. I won&#x2019;t tell you to discipline yourself because I know that your weight and eating habits are not the result of laziness, gluttony, or weak willpower.</p><p>You are trapped inside a body that is malfunctioning, and that body needs help. Years of dieting, psychotherapy, and the best pep talks about fitness can&#x2019;t help much when what you really need is a biochemical overhaul.</p><p>The clients who come to my clinic have already tried psychotherapy. If they haven&#x2019;t, or if they need more counseling, we provide it. We educate them about their health and encourage them to accept the body that their genes have programmed for them. But when that body is a wreck, psychological and educational approaches just aren&#x2019;t enough. Fortunately, we have now learned how to identify and repair the underlying physical imbalances that have been neglected for so long.</p><p>We used to think that dieting was the cure. Many of us still hope that the next diet will really &#x201c;do it.&#x201d; But more of us have learned that dieting leaves us in worse shape than before we ever started. Our health, energy, mood, and weight have all deteriorated because of dieting. <i>And yet we can&#x2019;t quit.</i> We know no other escape from the weight gain that followed our last diet! We need to be cured of dieting. We need to find an entirely new way to deal with our weight problems.</p><p>And we have. You&#x2019;re about to learn it.</p><p>I discovered the Diet Cure while I was desperately looking for a cure for alcohol and drug addiction. At that time I was the director of a large treatment complex in the San Francisco Bay Area, Ohlhoff Outpatient Programs. We provided intensive counseling for addicted adults and adolescents and their families in three counties. In 1986, I began hearing that certain nutritional supplements could stop addicts&#x2019; cravings for alcohol and even for cocaine. I asked my staff nutritionist to research and then to start offering these nutrients. They dramatically reduced our clients&#x2019; drug and alcohol cravings within a week. Much to our surprise, they also cured the insatiable cravings for sweets and the thirty-pound weight gain that our clients typically suffered in early recovery.*</p><p>In 1988, I opened my own outpatient treatment program. Staffed with nutritionists and counselors, the Recovery Systems Clinic, in Mill Valley, California, is five minutes north of San Francisco. Initially, my clients at Recovery Systems were food addicts and others concerned about serious eating disorders and weight problems. Compulsive overeating and bulimia were their most common complaints. Some anorexics came to us, too, as well as people without any eating disorders, but with weight gain that was intractable. If these sound like tough problems, you&#x2019;re wrong. We rarely failed to help even our most severely impaired clients because we had the secret weapon. We tried the same nutrients with them that I had used with my drug- and alcohol-addicted clients. They were even more effective for eliminating food cravings and had the delightful side effect of eliminating mood swings, too.</p><p>As the word spread, we began to get many clients who did not have full-blown eating disorders but were looking for an escape from yo-yo dieting, low energy, moodiness, and a tendency to eat too much bread and ice cream. You can imagine how easy it was for us to help them, having already discovered nutrients that were powerful enough to &#x201c;cure&#x201d; the cravings and mood problems of bulimics and drug addicts. These miracle nutrients are called amino acids.</p><p>Amino acids are the key to the Diet Cure. They are stronger than willpower and more effective and safer than any appetite-suppressing drugs. Available in every health food store in America, these isolated protein fragments are the super-nutrients that your brain uses to make its most powerful pleasure chemicals: serotonin (our natural Prozac), catecholamines (our natural cocaine), endorphins (naturally stronger than heroin), and GABA (naturally more relaxing than Xanax). A brain that is fully stocked with these natural mood enhancers simply has no need for a sugar high.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, you don&#x2019;t have to wait weeks or months to see changes: my clinic&#x2019;s clients consistently report that within twenty-four hours of taking amino acids, their food cravings disappear. Like them, you will no longer need to diet because you will have stopped overeating&#x2014;<i>naturally</i>. These benefits soon become permanent. After three to twelve months you won&#x2019;t need the amino acids and other corrective supplements anymore. Instead, you will be permanently freed from cravings and easily able to follow the Diet Cure&#x2019;s satisfying eating suggestions for life.</p><p>THE EIGHT STEPS</p><p>At Recovery Systems, we have discovered specific steps to overcoming each of the eight physical, <i>bodily</i> handicaps that can lead directly to food cravings, overeating, and unnecessary weight gain.</p><p></p><p><b>Step One:</b> Correcting BRAIN CHEMISTRY IMBALANCES to eradicate the negative feelings, like anxiety and depression, behind your &#x201c;emotional&#x201d; eating.</p><p><b>Step Two:</b> Ending the LOW-CALORIE DIETING that inevitably leads to problems with mood, energy, overeating, and weight.</p><p><b>Step Three:</b> Balancing UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR to eliminate the cravings for sweets and starches that propel us toward diabetes and adrenal exhaustion.</p><p><b>Step Four:</b> Repairing LOW THYROID FUNCTION, a common cause of unnecessary weight gain and the fatigue that makes exercise impossible.</p><p><b>Step Five:</b> Overcoming ADDICTIONS TO FOODS YOU&#x2019;RE ALLERGIC TO and associated symptoms such as bloating, headache, constipation, and asthma.</p><p><b>St...</b></p></p><h2>Self-Initiation Into the Golden Dawn Tradition: A Complete Curriculum of Study for Both the Solitary Magician and the Working Magical Group</h2><p><p>The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn has been considered one of the most important Western magical systems for over a century.

It's all or nothing. It's now or never.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's time to ante up and go all in with God.</p><p>No one has ever sacrificed anything for God. &nbsp;If you always get back more than you gave up, have you sacrificed anything at all? &nbsp;The eternal reward always outweighs the temporal sacrifice.&nbsp; At the end of the day, our greatest regret will be whatever we didn&#x2019;t give back to God.

Have comments like &#x201c;God&#x2019;s got this!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Just pray about it&#x201d; only left you feeling more burdened? We know we shouldn&#x2019;t worry, but the reality is that we all do at times. Whether it&#x2019;s personal worries about loved ones and daily circumstances or broader concerns about what&#x2019;s happening in the world, we long for something more than platitudes that will help us put real feet to our faith and win the worry battle.</p> <p>Many Christians do not have a full understanding of what it means to fight the good fight of faith. They try to live by faith but in the face of everyday trials and failures, they find themselves disillusioned and discouraged, wondering if they have done something wrong or if living by faith only works for others. The problem for most is simply a lack of understanding regarding what faith is and how it works. </p> <p>This book, inspired by the Book of Joshua, reviews three tools a person can develop to <em>Fight In Faith</em>: 1) embracing God's promises, 2) courage and commitment under pressure and 3) practicing radical obedience while waiting for God to deliver your victory.</p> <p>Just as God gave His people victory over their enemies when they fought in faith, He promises to do the same for us. Following the footprints of bold, courageous faith that God gave His people, we&#x2019;ll be equipped with tools to bravely fight in faith and overcome both our daily struggles and the bigger battles we all face. Through examples of how God gave the Israelites victory over their enemies and generously blessed them, too, we&#x2019;ll be victorious in our fight of faith so that we not only radically transform our own lives but unequivocally impact society.</p> <p>A companion six-week&nbsp;Bible study <em>Joshua: Winning the Worry Battle&nbsp;</em>is also available for those who would like to dig deeper into the book's&nbsp;topic.

This is her sixth cookbook with Bobby Flay and Stephanie Banyas.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>We all use the words &#x201c;backyard barbecue&#x201d; to describe an outdoor cookout. But true barbecuing means cooking food low and slow over an open flame. Most of the burgers and hot dogs served at your average backyard bash are actually grilled&#x2014;meaning they&#x2019;re cooked quickly over a hot fire. Even though people often use the words interchangeably, or even generically, grilling is not barbecuing. I should know.<br><br>I love to cook outdoors, but until recently my main means of doing so was on a gas grill. As a New York City&#x2013;born and &#x2013;raised guy, I couldn&#x2019;t be bothered with all the fuss of tending to a charcoal fire and then having to clean up the mess. Well, I am older and wiser now and can appreciate the pros and cons of both gas and charcoal. And when I built my summer house in the Hamptons, I finally got the chance to try out everything. While I still love my gas grill, I have since opened my heart to other outdoor cookers: charcoal grills, smokers, pizza ovens . . . you name it. And while, yes, these are messier and more time consuming to cook on, they make food that tastes amazing.&nbsp;<br><br>As an American chef I have always looked to my native country for barbecue inspiration, and with good reason. We have a spectacular belt of states throughout the South to the Southwest that each has its own take on the most talked about cuisine in America. Even places such as the central coast of California and the Pacific Northwest have their own distinct style of outdoor, wood-fired cookery. Those dishes help define a cuisine that is distinctly American and are the topic of the greatest food debate in the fifty states: Which state has the best BBQ?<br><br>While I won&#x2019;t touch that one with a ten-foot pole, I can say that as time went by and my travels began to take me overseas, I realized that almost every country, every culture, has its own version of barbecue. Although I always thought of barbecue as an American pastime, grilling burgers and hot dogs with my family at the Jersey Shore (pre MTV) when I was four or five years old, it turns out we were just like every other place in the world that loved cooking outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br>Now I not only look to my homeland but across the world for flavors, techniques, and ingredients. In these pages you&#x2019;ll find Tuscan Rosemary-Smoked Whole Chicken (page 117), a tip of the hat to northern Italy, next to Smoked Ginger Chicken with Cardamom, Cloves, and Cinnamon (page 123), a distinctly Indian taste explosion. Slow-Smoked Pork Shoulder with Napa Slaw and Queso Fresco (page 152) shares these pages with Coconut-Marinated Pork Tenderloin with Green Onion&#x2013;Peanut Relish (page 155). There are also recipes for quickly grilled dishes as well, such as Pimiento Cheese&#x2013;Bacon Burgers (page 199) that has the American South written all over it, and Rib Eye with Goat Cheese and Meyer Lemon&#x2013;Honey Mustard (page 189) that&#x2019;s straight from the center of Cali.<br><br>I get tons of questions while I&#x2019;m standing in my restaurant kitchens, walking down the street, and of course more than ever on social media about grilling fish and vegetables. Most people think of those amazing aromas in our backyards as charred meats and poultry, but more and more, as we all try to be a little bit more healthful, fish, shellfish, and vegetables are finding their way to the grill and the smoker. One of the new staples in my house is Hot-Smoked Salmon with Apples, Dried Cherries, Hazelnuts, and Greens (page 217) with an apple-cider-vinegar dressing for the crunchy salad; it&#x2019;s great for a crowd. Grilled Shrimp Skewers with Cilantro-Mint Chutney (page 256) make a great appetizer to get things started, along with Watermelon&#x2013;Plata Tequila Cocktails (page 44). Be careful, they go down like lemonade!<br><br>You&#x2019;ll notice that the starters, salads, and sides chapter of this book is quite large. In my opinion, these dishes really help complete a table. So when you&#x2019;ve got a serious barbecue going, make a handful of these: Fire-Roasted Corn with Mango-HabaneroCilantro Butter (page 69), Grilled Eggplant Caponata Bruschetta with Ricotta Salata (page 77), Grilled New Potatoes with Queso Fresco and Grilled Green Rajas (page 95), Grilled Asparagus with Figs, Cabrales, and Sherry Vinegar Sauce (page 54).<br><br>&#x2019;ve also expanded my horizons when it comes to cookers. The majority of the sales in the United States these days is for gas grills, mostly because of the ease and consistency of the heat&#x2014;plus, with their shiny stainless finishes, a lot of them look really cool in your backyard. However, a purist will use only live fire, and I have a few different grills these days. I love the Big Green Egg mostly for slow cooking and smoking. It has an amazing capacity for insulating the perfect amount of heat, and I find it to be super easy to use when it comes to smoking meats, fish, and vegetables. I&#x2019;ll always have a classic Weber kettle around for quickly grilled ingredients that need just one chimney starter full of hot charcoal. One of my all-time favorite cookers is called a Caja China. I call it the magic box. It&#x2019;s terrific for things like a whole hog, whole pork shoulders, and whole turkeys for Thanksgiving. My new favorite grill is what I call a &#x201c;crank grill,&#x201d; hand made by a gentleman named Chris Engelbrecht (see page 16). It makes life so easy because you can control the height of the grates for fast searing or slow cooking and you can escape those dastardly flare-ups. I love cooking chicken with the bone in and the skin on with this grill; it comes out perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and flavorful all the way through because of the control. There are so many choices, but in these pages I go over the merits of many of my favorites so you have options if you are looking to acquire a new cooker.<br><br>As I am writing this, my mouth is seriously beginning to water. Time to get off this computer and over to my outdoor kitchen! I&#x2019;m going to break out my chimney starter, fill it with hardwood charcoal (if you use lighter fluid you&#x2019;re fired from the grill), soak some wood chips, get out a spice rub, knock out a dipping sauce, toss together some slaw, and fire it up. If you can&#x2019;t tell, I&#x2019;m addicted to barbecue. <b>No intervention necessary.<br><br>Open-Faced Cuban Pulled Pork Sandwiches with Sour Orange-Jicama Slaw<br><br></b>Cuban food is not to be confused with other types of Latin cuisine&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not spicy and what it lacks in heat, it more than makes up for with herbaceous, garlicky, citruspunched flavor. The marinade for this pork butt is simple, but it makes an impact as it becomes one with the meat. Cooked slowly in a Caja China, the pork will be perfect every time because the fat melts into the meat and leaves it fork-tender. The tropical guava glaze, added only in the last hour of cooking so that the sugars don&#x2019;t burn, turns into an irresistible lacquer. A fresh and crunchy slaw balances the rich pulled pork in this insanely good sandwich. Serves 8<br><br>1 (4-pound) pork butt <br>5 garlic cloves, finely chopped, plus 3 cloves, smashed to a paste <br>3/4 cup canola oil <br>Scant 1/4 cup fresh oregano leaves, plus 2 teaspoons finely chopped <br>1 1/2 cups guava jelly <br>1/4 cup Dijon mustard <br>Finely grated zest of 1 orange <br>1/4 cup fresh orange juice <br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened <br>4 Cuban bread loaves or foot-long soft baguettes, sliced lengthwise <br>1/2 cup mayonnaise <br>Sour Orange-Jicama Slaw (recipe follows)<br><br>1. Using a paring knife, make small slits over the entire surface of the pork and rub the chopped garlic into the slashes. <br>2. Combine the oil and oregano leaves in a blender and blend until smooth. Put the pork in a large roasting pan or bowl, add the oregano marinade, and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. <br>3. Remove the pork from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. <br>4. Whisk together the guava jelly, mustard, orange zest, and orange juice in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. <br>5. Prepare your Caja China according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s directions. Light 12 pounds of charcoal for model #1 or 16 pounds for model #2 in batches in a chimney starter and allow to burn until covered with a fine layer of gray ash, 20 to 25 minutes. <br>6. Season the pork liberally with salt and pepper. Put the pork on the rack of the Caja China. Cover the box with the ash pan&nbsp;and charcoal grid. Spread the hot charcoal over the grid. Cook, adding hot charcoal as needed, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s directions, for 2 1/2 hours. <br>7. After 2 1/2 hours, baste with the guava glaze and continue to cook, basting every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 180�F, about 1 hour more. <br>8. Remove the roast from the box, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Using tongs, pull the pork into bite-sized pieces and toss with more of the guava glaze. <br>9. Stir together the butter, garlic paste, and chopped oregano and season with salt and pepper. Spread each half of bread with some of the garlic butter and place on a hot grill pan until lightly golden brown, about 20 seconds. <br>10. Spread both sides of the bread with some of the mayonnaise. Mound some of the pork on top of the mayonnaise and top the pork with some of the slaw. Serve the sandwiches open faced.<br><br><b>Sour Orange-Jicama Slaw <br></b><br>Serves 8 <br><br>1 teaspoon grated orange zest <br>1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest <br>1/2 cup fresh orange juice <br>1/4 cup fresh lime juice <br>1 tablespoon sugar <br>1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced <br>1/2 jicama, julienned <br>1/4 head red cabbage, finely shredded <br>1 large carrot, julienned <br>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves <br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br><br>Whisk together the orange and lime zests and juices and the sugar in a large bowl. Add the onion, jicama, cabbage, carrot, and cilantro and season with salt and pepper.

Yet most Protestants, and too many Catholics don&#39;t understand the role that God wants her to play in our lives. In Behold Your Mother, Tim Staples takes you through the Church&#39;s teachings about the Blessed Virgin Mary, showing their firm Scriptural and historical roots and dismantling the objections of those who mistakenly believe that Mary competes for the attention due Christ alone. Combining the best recent scholarship with a convert&#39;s in-depth knowledge of the arguments, Staples has assembled the most thorough and useful Marian apologetic you&#39;ll find anywhere. Relevant and essential -- Mary matters. Read Behold Your Mother and find out just how much.</p><p>Tim Staples is Director of Apologetics and Evangelization here at Catholic Answers, but he was not always Catholic. Tim was raised a Southern Baptist. Although he fell away from the faith of his childhood, Tim came back to faith in Christ during his late teen years through the witness of Christian televangelists. Soon after, Tim joined the Marine Corps. During his four-year tour, he became involved in ministry with various Assemblies of God communities. Immediately after his tour of duty, Tim enrolled in Jimmy Swaggart Bible College and became a youth minister in an Assembly of God community. During his final year in the Marines, however, Tim met a Marine who really knew his faith and challenged Tim to study Catholicism from Catholic and historical sources. That encounter sparked a two-year search for the truth. Tim was determined to prove Catholicism wrong, but he ended up studying his way to the last place he thought he would ever end up: the Catholic Church! He converted to Catholicism in 1988 and spent the following six years in formation for the priesthood, earning a degree in philosophy from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, Pennsylvania. He then studied theology on a graduate level at Mount St. Mary s Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, for two years. Realizing that his calling was not to the priesthood, Tim left the seminary in 1994 and has been working in Catholic apologetics and evangelization ever since.Tim Staples respectfully but clearly answers every conceivable Protestant objection to Mary, the Mother of God. With the street cred of one who has been there, Tim backs up his words with Scripture every time. His answers are exhaustive but not exhausting! An invaluable book for thoughtful, truth-seeking Christians. --Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J., EWTN host and author of Mary: Virgin, Mother, and Queen<br><br>The greatest doctrinal obstacle to my return to the Catholic Church was fear that Catholics had no basis for or boundaries on the Marian dogmas. If only Tim Staples had written Behold Your Mother then! His presentation is fearless, precise, biblically wise, historically rooted, and popular in expression. He addresses objections I haven t seen addressed elsewhere. I can t think of a more insightful, comprehensive single volume that persuades so thoroughly. Great, truly great, piece of apologetics. --Al Kresta- Host of Kresta in the Afternoon<br><br>Tim Staples presents a remarkable defense of the six major Marian doctrines, including a veritable compendium of source material from the Bible, Fathers, and Church documents. He gives clear presentations of the controversial issues surrounding each doctrine, makes careful definitions and distinctions, and thinks his way through each issue as if he were having a conversation with the reader. Even well-informed readers will benefit from this engaging book. --Fr. Robert J. Spitzer, President, Magis Center of Reason and Faith</p><h2>The Little Soul and the Earth: I&#39;m Somebody!

Sunlight reflected off the many<br>mirrorlike windows of those massive structures, and gleamed<br>brilliantly off the chrome of the sleek ships. The larger starship,<br>which resembled a flying silver boomerang, almost glowed,<br>smooth and flowing with huge and powerful engines set on<br>each of its arms, a third of the way to the wingtip. Alongside it<br>soared several Naboo starfighters, their graceful engines set out<br>on wings from the main hulls with their distinctive elongated<br>tails.<br><br>One of the starfighters led the procession, veering around<br>and about nearly every passing tower, running point for the second<br>ship, the Naboo Royal Cruiser. Behind that larger craft came<br>two more fighters, running swift and close to the Royal Cruiser,<br>shielding her, pilots ready to instantly intercept any threat.<br><br>The lead fighter avoided the more heavily trafficked routes of<br>the great city, where potential enemies might be flying within the<br>cover of thousands of ordinary vehicles. Many knew that Senator<br>Amidala of Naboo was returning to the Senate to cast her vote<br>against the creation of an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi in<br>their dealings with the increasingly antagonistic separatist movement,<br>and there were many factions that did not want such a vote<br>to be cast. Amidala had made many enemies during her reign as<br>Naboo&#x2019;s Queen, powerful enemies with great resources at their<br>disposal, and with, perhaps, enough hatred for the beautiful<br>young Senator to put some of those resources to work to her<br>detriment.<br><br>In the lead fighter, Corporal Dolphe, who had distinguished<br>himself greatly in the Naboo war against the Trade Federation,<br>breathed a sigh of relief as the appointed landing platform came<br>into sight, appearing secure and clear. Dolphe, a tough warrior<br>who revered his Senator greatly, flew past the landing platform<br>to the left, then cut a tight turn back to the right, encircling the<br>great structure, the Senatorial Apartment Building, adjacent to<br>the landing platform. He kept his fighter up and about as the<br>other two fighters put down side by side on one end of the platform,<br>the Royal Cruiser hovering nearby for just a moment,<br>then gently landing.<br><br>Dolphe did another circuit, then, seeing no traffic at all in<br>the vicinity, settled his fighter across the way from his companion<br>craft. He didn&#x2019;t put it down all the way just yet, though, but<br>remained ready to swivel about and strike hard at any attackers,<br>if need be.<br><br>Opposite him, the other two fighter pilots threw back<br>their respective canopies and climbed from their cockpits. One,<br>Captain Typho, recently appointed as Amidala&#x2019;s chief security<br>officer by his uncle Panaka, pulled off his flight helmet and<br>shook his head, running a hand over his short, woolly black<br>hair and adjusting the black leather patch he wore over his<br>left eye.<br><br>&#x201c;We made it,&#x201d; Typho said as his fellow fighter pilot leapt<br>down from a wing to stand beside him. &#x201c;I guess I was wrong.<br>There was no danger at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always danger, Captain,&#x201d; the other responded in a<br>distinctly female voice. &#x201c;Sometimes we&#x2019;re just lucky enough to<br>avoid it.&#x201d;<br><br>Typho started to respond, but paused and looked back<br>toward the cruiser, where the ramp was already lowering to the<br>platform. The plan had been to get the contingent off the exposed<br>platform and into a transport vehicle as quickly as possible.<br>Two Naboo guards appeared, alert and ready, their blaster<br>rifles presented before them. Typho nodded grimly, glad to see<br>that his soldiers were taking nothing for granted, that they<br>understood the gravity of the situation and their responsibility<br>here in protecting the Senator.<br><br>Next came Amidala, in her typical splendor, with her paradoxical<br>beauty, both simple and involved. With her large brown<br>eyes and soft features, Amidala could outshine anyone about<br>her, even if she was dressed in simple peasant&#x2019;s clothing, but in<br>her Senatorial attire, this time a fabulous weave of black and<br>white, and with her hair tied up and exaggerated by a black<br>headdress, she outshone the stars themselves. Her mixture of intelligence<br>and beauty, of innocence and allure, of courage and<br>integrity and yet with a good measure of a child&#x2019;s mischievous-ness,<br>floored Typho every time he looked upon her.<br><br>The captain turned from the descending entourage back to<br>Dolphe across the way, offering a satisfied nod in acknowledgment<br>of the man&#x2019;s point-running work.<br><br>And then, suddenly, Typho was lying facedown on the permacrete,<br>thrown to the ground by a tremendous concussion,<br>blinded for a moment by a brilliant flash as an explosion roared<br>behind him. He looked up as his vision returned to see Dolphe<br>sprawled on the ground.<br><br>Everything seemed to move in slow motion for Typho at<br>that terrible moment. He heard himself yelling &#x201c;No!&#x201d; as he<br>scrambled to his knees and turned about.<br><br>Pieces of burning metal spread through the Coruscant sky<br>like fireworks, fanning high and wide from the wreckage.

His blue eyes<br>flashed repeatedly, as if bursts of energy were escaping.<br>&#x201c;Just to lengthen our time in hyperspace a bit,&#x201d; he explained.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll come out closer to the planet.&#x201d;<br><br>Obi-Wan gave a great and resigned sigh and sat down at the<br>console, noting the coordinates Anakin had input. There was little<br>the Jedi could do about it now, of course, for a hyperspace<br>leap couldn&#x2019;t be reset once the jump to lightspeed had already<br>been made. &#x201c;We cannot exit hyperspace too close to Coruscant&#x2019;s<br>approach lanes. There&#x2019;s too much congestion for a safe<br>flight. I&#x2019;ve already explained this to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anakin,&#x201d; Obi-Wan said pointedly, as if he were scolding a<br>pet perootu cat, and he tightened his wide jaw and stared hard<br>at his Padawan.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Master,&#x201d; Anakin said, obediently looking down.<br><br>Obi-Wan held the glare for just a moment longer. &#x201c;I know<br>that you&#x2019;re anxious to get there,&#x201d; he conceded. &#x201c;We have been<br>too long away from home.&#x201d;<br><br>Anakin didn&#x2019;t look up, but Obi-Wan could see the edges of<br>his lips curl up in a bit of a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Never do this again,&#x201d; Obi-Wan warned, and he turned and<br>walked out of the shuttle&#x2019;s bridge.<br><br>Anakin flopped down into the pilot&#x2019;s chair, his chin falling<br>into his hand, his eyes set on the control panels. The order had<br>been about as direct as one could get, of course, and so Anakin<br>silently told himself that he would adhere to it. Still, as he considered<br>their current destination, and who awaited them there,<br>he thought the scolding worth it, even if his resetting of the coordinates<br>had bought him only a few extra hours on Coruscant.<br>He was indeed anxious to get there, though not for the reason<br>Obi-Wan had stated. It wasn&#x2019;t the Jedi Temple that beckoned to<br>the Padawan, but rather a rumor he had heard over the comm<br>chatter that a certain Senator, formerly the Queen of Naboo,<br>was on her way to address the Senate.<br><br>Padm� Amidala.<br><br>The name resonated in young Anakin&#x2019;s heart and soul. He<br>hadn&#x2019;t seen her in a decade, not since he, along with Obi-Wan<br>and Qui-Gon, had helped her in her struggle against the Trade<br>Federation on Naboo. He had only been ten years old at that<br>time, but from the moment he had first laid eyes on Padm�,<br>young Anakin had known that she was the woman he would<br>marry.<br><br>Never mind that Padm� was several years older than he was.<br>Never mind that he was just a boy when he had known her,<br>when she had known him. Never mind that Jedi were not allowed<br>to marry.<br><br>Anakin had simply known, without question, and the image<br>of beautiful Padm� Amidala had stayed with him, had been<br>burned into his every dream and fantasy, every day since he had<br>left Naboo with Obi-Wan a decade ago. He could still smell the<br>freshness of her hair, could still see the sparkle of intelligence<br>and passion in her wondrous brown eyes, could still hear the<br>melody that was Padm�&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>Hardly registering the movement, Anakin let his hands return<br>to the controls of the nav computer. Perhaps he could find<br>a little-used lane through the Coruscant traffic congestion to get<br>them home faster.<br>Klaxons blared and myriad alarms rent the air all about the<br>area, screaming loudly, drowning out the cries from the astonished<br>onlookers and the wails of the injured.<br><br>Typho&#x2019;s companion pilot raced past him, and the cap-tain<br>scrambled to regain his footing and follow. Across the way,<br>Dolphe was up and similarly running toward the fallen form of<br>the Senator.<br><br>The female fighter pilot arrived first, dropping to one knee<br>beside the fallen woman. She pulled the helmet from her head<br>and quickly shook her brown tresses free.<br><br>&#x201c;Senator!&#x201d; Typho yelled. It was indeed Padm� Amidala<br>kneeling beside the dying woman, her decoy. &#x201c;Come, the danger<br>has not passed!&#x201d;<br><br>But Padm� waved the captain back furiously, then bent low<br>to her fallen friend.<br><br>&#x201c;Cord�,&#x201d; she said quietly, her voice breaking. Cord� was one<br>of her beloved bodyguards, a woman who had been with her,<br>serving her and serving Naboo, for many years. Padm� gathered<br>Cord� up in her arms, hugging her gently.<br><br>Cord� opened her eyes, rich brown orbs so similar to<br>Padm�&#x2019;s own. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, m&#x2019;Lady,&#x201d; she gasped, struggling for<br>breath with every word. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m . . . not sure I . . .&#x201d; She paused<br>and lay there, staring at Padm�. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve failed you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Padm� insisted, arguing the bodyguard&#x2019;s reasoning,<br>arguing against all of this insanity. &#x201c;No, no, no!&#x201d;<br><br>Cord� continued to stare at her, or stare past her, it seemed<br>to the grief-stricken young Senator. Looking past her and past<br>everything, Cord�&#x2019;s eyes stared into a far different place.<br><br>Padm� felt her relax suddenly, as if her spirit simply leapt<br>from her corporeal form.<br><br>&#x201c;Cord�!&#x201d; the Senator cried, and she hugged her friend<br>close, rocking back and forth, denying this awful reality.<br><br>&#x201c;M&#x2019;Lady, you are still in danger!&#x201d; Typho declared, trying<br>to sound sympathetic, but with a clear sense of urgency in his<br>voice.<br><br>Padm� lifted her head from the side of Cord�&#x2019;s face, and<br>took a deep and steadying breath. Looking upon her dead friend,<br>remembering all at once the many times they had spent together,<br>she gently lowered Cord� to the ground. &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have come<br>back,&#x201d; she said as she stood up beside the wary Typho, tears<br>streaking her cheeks.<br><br>Captain Typho came up out of his ready stance long enough<br>to lock stares with his Senator. &#x201c;This vote is very important,&#x201d; he<br>reminded her, his tone uncompromising, the voice of a man<br>sworn to duty above all else. So much like his uncle. &#x201c;You did<br>your duty, Senator, and Cord� did hers. Now come.&#x201d;<br><br>He started away, grabbing Padm�&#x2019;s arm, but she shrugged<br>off his grasp and stood there, staring down at her lost friend.<br><br>&#x201c;Senator Amidala! Please!&#x201d;<br><br>Padm� looked over at the man.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you so diminish Cord�&#x2019;s death as to stand here and<br>risk your own life?&#x201d; Typho bluntly stated. &#x201c;What good will her<br>sacrifice be if&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Enough, Captain,&#x201d; Padm� interrupted.<br><br>Typho motioned for Dolphe to run a defensive perimeter<br>behind them, then he led the stricken Padm� away.<br><br>Back over at Padm�&#x2019;s Naboo fighter, R2-D2 beeped and<br>squealed and fell into line behind them.</p><h2>You Are What You Think</h2><p>"Attitude is everything."

Listen, the only crystals on me are the Swarovski ones covering my Louboutins. I may not be your idea of a &#x201c;typical&#x201d; medium, but dead people don&#x2019;t care. They&#x2019;ve been bugging me to deliver their messages since I was a child, and that&#x2019;s what I feel compelled and blessed to do.<br> <br>I grew up on Long Island in a town called Hicksville, with my mom, dad, and younger brother, Michael. Mom was a bookkeeper and my dad was the public works supervisor for Nassau County. We were extremely close and still are. I was actually raised for most of my life in the house next door to the one I live in now. We have a gate in the back that connects our two yards, and Dad likes to use it so he can futz around in both our tomato gardens. When people come for readings, they sit at my dining room table, which looks out onto the back. I always say, &#x201c;If you see someone out there, it&#x2019;s not a dead person walking around. It&#x2019;s just my dad!&#x201d;<br> <br>Growing up, I had the most loving, happy, and seemingly normal childhood. I was on a traveling soccer team and local bowling league. I loved playing with my dolls&#x2019; hair&#x2014;I always thought I&#x2019;d be a hairdresser, go figure. I had nice friends, got good grades, and spent a lot of free time with my family. I was always with my cousins, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. On Thursdays, we&#x2019;d have spaghetti and meatballs at Nanny and Pop&#x2019;s house; on Saturdays, I&#x2019;d paint ceramics with Auntie G; and on Sundays, our whole extended family would go to Gram and Gramp&#x2019;s house after church to spend the afternoon eating, laughing, and telling stories.<br> <br>It was like the Long Island Italian version of Leave It to Beaver, but with a twist that literally kept us all up at night. I used to have the most frightening dreams, which made no sense given that my days were so carefree. These were actually my first memories of seeing, feeling, and hearing Spirit, though I didn&#x2019;t know that&#x2019;s what was happening. My first vivid experience happened when I was just four years old. At the time, we lived in my dad&#x2019;s childhood home, which is right near the Hicksville Gregory Museum, a former 1915 courthouse that also had jail cells for prisoners in it. Some people think old buildings like prisons, with their history of pain and suffering, can hold on to Spirit. What a place for me of all people to grow up around! Anyway, I&#x2019;d have a recurring dream where, from a window on the second floor of our house, I&#x2019;d watch a man pace on the sidewalk out front. He&#x2019;d chant my name, Theresa Brigandi, Theresa Brigandi, Theresa Brigandi . . . over, and over, and over again. Can you imagine how scary that was to a freaking four-year-old? I never saw the man&#x2019;s face, but he was always hunched over and carrying a stick with a bandanna sack on the end. He wore ragged clothes and looked like a hobo.<br> <br>Spirit later told me that this dream was actually a visitation, and I now believe this &#x201c;man&#x201d; to be one of my spirit guides for that time in my life. This doesn&#x2019;t mean the spirit guide is literally a bum. It&#x2019;s more like those Bible stories where people invite in the poor, and then later find out the person&#x2019;s an angel. I now believe a hobo is the unassuming image that my guide took so that I&#x2019;d understand the Sunday school reference and feel okay when he called my name. I was raised Roman Catholic and still practice this today, so I think my guide presented himself through my frame of reference, a little like how Spirit shows me signs and symbols during a reading now. They do it in a way that makes sense to me, so that it&#x2019;s easy for me to interpret the message.<br> <br>When I was four, a hobo equaled a gentle, godly man&#x2014;at least when I was awake. At night, seeing, hearing, and sensing one made me cry out like I was being violently attacked. Again, I don&#x2019;t think I was experiencing negative Spirit, and I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming that Spirit pushed me around or anything; the dreams themselves weren&#x2019;t &#x201c;bad.&#x201d; I was terrified because I&#x2019;d feel Spirit&#x2019;s energy, while seeing and hearing them talk to me, in this alarmingly real and personal way.<br> <br>My inconsolable screams rattled my family more than what caused them, and my social life became limited. I couldn&#x2019;t go to slumber parties or sleep at my grandmother&#x2019;s house without wondering what I&#x2019;d feel next. I didn&#x2019;t feel safe anywhere but at home, and even that wasn&#x2019;t a given. Besides the hobo, I also saw my great-�grandmother on my mom&#x2019;s side of the family. She&#x2019;d died four years before I was born, and I didn&#x2019;t realize who it was until much later when I saw a picture of her. But I&#x2019;ll never forget her standing at the foot of my bed&#x2014;she was short with dark hair and wearing a housedress. I&#x2019;d scream like a crazy person when I saw her too. Poor lady was no three-headed monster, though I sure reacted like she was!<br> <br>In the morning, I&#x2019;d forget most of these night terrors or how long they went on. I&#x2019;m told they&#x2019;d pass when my mom or dad would turn on the light and rush into the room. So did this make Spirit leave? I don&#x2019;t know. But after a while, Mom made up a prayer to help me keep Spirit at arm&#x2019;s length. It went, &#x201c;Dear God, please keep me safe through the night. Bless . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;and then I&#x2019;d name all the people in our lives, and those in Heaven. And wouldn&#x2019;t you know, every time I said that prayer before bed, I&#x2019;d sleep soundly, and so would my parents. I continued this when we eventually moved into our new home, the one my parents live in now, though I always kept the hall light on.<br> <br>Even when I traveled with my family, I never got a break from Spirit. We took a lot of vacations together, including an annual camping trip with my grandparents for the entire summer. Most people at the site were lucky to have a tent with a Bunsen burner; we had this awesome trailer with a shower, kitchen, a screened-in porch so the bugs wouldn&#x2019;t get at our food, everything. My grandmother made scrambled eggs and French toast in the mornings, and in the afternoons, we&#x2019;d have bicycle races and go tire swinging into the lake. At night, we&#x2019;d play pinball at the rec hall, roast marshmallows, and sing campfire songs. I was a regular Girl Scout! But no matter how much fun we had during the day, or how relaxed I felt, my night terrors would strike like they did at home. Only this time the whole area heard me! My grandparents even warned our fellow campers in advance&#x2014;if you hear someone screaming bloody murder, it doesn&#x2019;t mean there&#x2019;s a bear or maniac on the loose! It&#x2019;s just Theresa having a night terror. One time my parents wanted me to sleep with them in a tent, and I was deathly afraid of it. I felt safer in the camper, especially since I was seeing shadows against the canvas. I was so adamant about staying out that I kicked and screamed, and gave my father a fat lip. He was so mad. I was this close to knocking over the lantern and setting the whole tent on fire.<br> <br>Though I handled Spirit&#x2019;s appearances much better during the day, they were still a surprise. For instance, I clearly remember seeing three-dimensional people walk in front of the TV. I&#x2019;d be sitting on our green tweed sofa, watching Romper Room, when a person would pass by and then fade out. One time this happened when I had a babysitter over, and I asked her if she&#x2019;d just seen what I did. She said no and gave me a funny look, so I played it off. I kind of wondered if I was seeing things or had an overly active imagination, but I didn&#x2019;t dwell on it. It&#x2019;s like when you see a shadow out of the corner of your eye, or stare at a light too long and then watch a yellow shape float across the room&#x2014;you assume that you&#x2019;re just seeing things and don&#x2019;t think much of it. I also remember getting a kitchen set for Easter one year as a kid, arranging my pots a certain way when I was done playing house, and when I came back to them in the morning, they were in a completely different spot. That must&#x2019;ve been Spirit too. Listen, I know my brother, Michael, didn&#x2019;t touch them!<br> <br>Who&#x2019;s to Say What&#x2019;s Normal?<br> <br>As I got older, I began to feel anxious and strange in my body. I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on what could be causing it. I&#x2019;d say to Mom, I don&#x2019;t feel right. I don&#x2019;t feel like I belong. I feel different. I felt as if there was something going on that needed to be explained. One of the few places I actually felt safe and secure was in church. I even played guitar in a church folk group. God&#x2019;s house was the only other home, other than my own, where I felt peaceful and comfortable in my skin. I often say that if I weren&#x2019;t a medium, I could&#x2019;ve been a schizophrenic or a nun. Seriously, sometimes those felt like my two most realistic options. Imagine? My parents spoiled me with so much love, but that didn&#x2019;t take away from the fact that I sensed something about me was off.<br> <br>Sometimes I&#x2019;d ask God, Why is this happening? Why do I feel so afraid all the time? But I&#x2019;d never get mad or angry at Him, or lose my beliefs. That wasn&#x2019;t how I was raised. I don&#x2019;t like to use the word &#x201c;religious,&#x201d; but I did come from a strong faith family. I was taught to say prayers at night and before every meal. My parents also had an open mind about all spirituality. It&#x2019;s funny, because not all Catholics do. But to us, faith, spirituality . . . it all comes from God.<br> <br>When I wasn&#x2019;t at church, my anxiety could get so bad that I didn&#x2019;t want to leave the house. I didn&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;d sense or feel something, at any given moment of the day. I realized that every place I went came with a different sensation, and I sometimes felt like I was being watched. When I&#x2019;d tell this to Mom, she&#x2019;d sit me down and say, &#x201c;Your safe place is you.&#x201d; I could go anywhere, because I was my grounding force. For a long time, that mind-set worked.<br> <br>Even still, I was clearly seeing and sensing things that other people weren&#x2019;t. When I was out with my friends at the mall or the bowling alley, I&#x2019;d ask if they saw a man walk by or heard someone call their name, because I secretly had, and they&#x2019;d go, &#x201c;Uh, no. What are you talking about?&#x201d; Or sometimes I&#x2019;d receive a message, which I&#x2019;d assume was just my own random thought and not realize that it had any meaning, or that I&#x2019;d even thought of anything, until it was validated later. For example, if I was on my way to the fair, I might hear a voice tell me, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t eat the cotton candy.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ignore it, and then a friend would tell me the cotton candy made her sick. But even then, I just assumed that I got better hunches about people and situations than maybe some friends or strangers did.<br> <br>Again, I believed that I was my safe place. So seeing, hearing, and sensing something around me all the time became my normal. Doctors have always said that our bodies are built to adapt; if a feeling or experience goes on for long enough, the brain learns to disregard it, work around it, or just treat it as normal. I know now that seeing and sensing Spirit isn&#x2019;t most people&#x2019;s typical experience, but it was routine for me, and I didn&#x2019;t have too many people disputing it. As a child, my family and friends just laughed when I&#x2019;d occasionally say strange things, but never pursued the subject much further. (Mom recently joked that my abilities give a whole new meaning to when I used to say there was a monster, imaginary friend, or ghost in my room!) And for as many times as friends didn&#x2019;t agree with what I&#x2019;d heard or seen, I did have family who had similar experiences because they&#x2019;re also sensitive. In fact, my cousin Johnny Boy used to jokingly call me and my cousin Lisa &#x201c;freaks,&#x201d; and nicknamed us &#x201c;Para&#x201d; and &#x201c;Noid,&#x201d; when we told him we&#x2019;d see or feel things. We also used to go shopping separately and come home with the same outfits! But at the time, all Lisa and I knew was that we had unusual, shared experiences that made encounters with what we now know is Spirit just part of our lives. As for my smart-aleck cousin Johnny, he was living in my grandmother&#x2019;s house ten years later and saw her standing in the hall when he was coming out of the shower. Who&#x2019;s laughing now?<br> <br>When my peers became mouthy teenagers, things began to change. Between the ages of about twelve and fourteen, I began to feel less comfortable with what was happening around me, mostly because of how people reacted to my observations. My family was still blas� about stuff I said, but when I&#x2019;d casually ask if a friend saw or felt something, they&#x2019;d be like, &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s weird, there&#x2019;s nobody there. Nobody hears or sees things the way you do!&#x201d; What once seemed normal now wasn&#x2019;t, so I decided to block my experiences out altogether. I didn&#x2019;t say a special prayer to make Spirit stop or anything; I just didn&#x2019;t acknowledge Spirit&#x2019;s attempts to communicate with me. Keep in mind, this was before every TV channel had a ghost-hunting show and John Edward was a household name. People didn&#x2019;t talk about this stuff. Nobody, including me, could&#x2019;ve guessed what was really going on. It was never part of a comfortable, mainstream conversation.<br> <br>By the time I was sixteen years old, I was lucky that I hadn&#x2019;t lost a lot of loved ones, but this also means that I didn&#x2019;t have recognizable Spirit visiting me. When Nanny, my father&#x2019;s mom, died, I was devastated. We were very close, and everyone missed her a lot. After she passed, my dad&#x2019;s older sister, whom we call Auntie, had a psychic come to Nanny&#x2019;s house. I didn&#x2019;t know why at the time, but I now think it was to get in touch with her. I didn&#x2019;t want to go, and I felt a little afraid&#x2014;mostly because I didn&#x2019;t know what a psychic really was or did. But I knew I&#x2019;d feel safe at Nanny&#x2019;s house, so I went anyway. And for the first time in a long time I didn&#x2019;t block Spirit.<br> <br>I felt Nanny&#x2019;s energy and soul near the window, and my family kept asking me why I was by the drapes when everyone else was at the kitchen table. They also asked me whom I was talking to, though I don&#x2019;t remember what I was saying. (It&#x2019;s similar to how I can&#x2019;t recall most of what Spirit says after I channel for others.) After a minute of this, my family had to interrupt me in their usual, teasing way. They kept it lighthearted and didn&#x2019;t freak out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Theresa, who are you talking to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking to Nanny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure you are. Nanny&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know she&#x2019;s dead, but I&#x2019;m talking to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Auntie and my cousins might have been confused but didn&#x2019;t make it a big deal. I was known to blurt out crazy things, but was this any stranger than having a psychic over for coffee? They were clearly open to spiritual conversations that I hadn&#x2019;t considered yet.<br> <br>When I think about this memory now, I can physically smell Nanny&#x2019;s house and see everything in it&#x2014;the plastic-covered furniture, marble end tables, her sparkly dining room chandelier, a painting of The Last Supper, and those gold drapes. It was very gaudy Italian. And as I tell this story, I get a vision, like a quick filmstrip, of Nanny standing at the stove, smoking her cigarette all the way down to a really long ash that&#x2019;s dangling over a bubbling spaghetti pot. She&#x2019;d let that cigarette burn until only the filter was left, and yet the ashes never fell into her gravy. She loved her jewelry, and in my memory, she&#x2019;s wearing all these diamonds. Like me, you know?<br> <br>After my little encounter with Nanny, I went back to completely ignoring Spirit. My uncle Julie died during my senior year of high school, and around that time, my anxieties began to get much worse than they&#x2019;d been. I developed random phobias, many of which had to do with feeling claustrophobic. The night terrors had long past, but I still had restless sleep habits. Instead of waking up screaming, I&#x2019;d jump out of bed, feeling like I couldn&#x2019;t breathe to save my life.<br> <br>Then Along Came Larry</p><h2>Bach -- Selections from Anna Magdalena&#39;s Notebook (Alfred Masterwork Edition)</h2><p>This timeless collection contains selections attributed to J.

This feeling only deepened when his family moved from Japan to North Korea when Ishikawa was just thirteen years old, and unwittingly became members of the lowest social caste. His father, himself a Korean national, was lured to the new Communist country by promises of abundant work, education for his children, and a higher station in society. But the reality of their new life was far from utopian.</p><p>In this memoir translated from the original Japanese, Ishikawa candidly recounts his tumultuous upbringing and the brutal thirty-six years he spent living under a crushing totalitarian regime, as well as the challenges he faced repatriating to Japan after barely escaping North Korea with his life. <i>A River in Darkness</i> is not only a shocking portrait of life inside the country but a testament to the dignity&#x2014;and indomitable nature&#x2014;of the human spirit.</p></p><p><p>Born in 1947 in Kawasaki, Japan, Masaji Ishikawa moved with his parents and three sisters to North Korea in 1960 at the age of thirteen, where he lived until his escape in 1996. He currently resides in Japan.</p><p>&#x201c;A terrifying true story of life in North Korea...Told in simple prose, this is a shocking and devastating tale of a country&#x2019;s utter contempt for its citizens.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;In his achingly straightforward memoir, Ishikawa vividly describes the horrendous conditions that the tyrannical and cultish state inflicts on its people...Ishikawa relates his painful story with sardonic humor and unwavering familial love even in the depths of despair, making human the often impersonal news coverage of mysterious and threatening North Korea.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b></p><p>&#x201c;Like Kang Chol-hwan&#x2019;s <i>The Aquariums of Pyongyang</i> (2001)&#x2014;the book that spurred President George W.

As he grows, he becomes a skilled hunter and trader, and is so respected by the people in the area that their town is named after him. The story is pleasant and the artwork excellent but the value of this book as an authentic native legend is uncertain. It is simple enough to prove the factual existence of Chief Ignatius Petosegay, and perhaps even to establish him as the namesake of the town and the fossilized coral remnants referenced in the title. Unfortunately, since the author does not provide any sources, there is no indication that this tale accurately represents any traditional story of the Anishinabe peoples in Michigan. While the writing flows well, especially for reading aloud, the story seems a little too simplistic at face value. Frankenhuyzen's paintings are undeniably beautiful, full-page bleeds that cover each spread, with text well placed in unoccupied areas. As with <i>The Legend of Sleeping Bear</i>(Sleeping Bear, 1998) and other books by this author-illustrator team, <i>Petoskey</i> is sure to be scooped up by local legend lovers. The lack of documentation, however, prevents it from being considered a real gem.<i>&#x2013;Sean George, Memphis-Shelby County Public Library &amp; Information Center, Memphis, TN</i></p><h2>The Berenstain Bears' Please &amp; Thank You Book</h2><p>The cherished Bear family is coming to a new generation of toddler and preschool readers!

To the rescue comes Kabir Helminski, a modern-day Sufi who has wrapped up a sampler of Rumi's inspirational poems. Let's not object that about half of the translations are from Kabir's own hand (in cooperation with his wife, Camille) since they are excellent in their own respect and are accompanied by pieces from the likes of Robert Bly, Coleman Barks, and Andrew Harvey. As editor, Helminski spans the range of Rumi's oeuvre, from the contemplative "Stay Close, My Heart" to the ecstatic "Drowned in God" to the whimsical "Animal Cookies." The magic of Rumi is his imagery. The journey to God comes cloaked in such guises as a tailor, bread, buttermilk, a surgeon, chickpeas, the edge of a roof, a beggar, a jar, and an elephant's dream. Two of the tastiest treats are "Eating Poetry" and "Love Is Like a Lawsuit." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Kabir Helminski is the author of&nbsp;<i>Living Presence: A Sufi Way to Mindfulness and the Essential Self,&nbsp;</i>as well as the translator of numerous books of Sufi literature and especially Rumi.

But in a few short years, he lost his job, got divorced, and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. With no money or health insurance, he was forced to get a job at Starbucks. Having gone from power lunches to scrubbing toilets, from being served to serving, Michael was a true fish out of water.<br><br> But fate brings an unexpected teacher into his life who opens his eyes to what living well really looks like. The two seem to have nothing in common: She is a young African American, the daughter of a drug addict; he is used to being the boss but reports to <i>her</i> now. For the first time in his life he experiences being a member of a minority trying hard to survive in a challenging new job. He learns the value of hard work and humility, as well as what it truly means to respect another person.<br><br> Behind the scenes at one of America&#x2019;s most intriguing businesses, an inspiring friendship is born, a family begins to heal, and, thanks to his unlikely mentor, Michael Gill at last experiences a sense of self-worth and happiness he has never known before.<br><br><b>Watch a QuickTime trailer for this book.</b></p><p>The son of <i>New Yorker</i> writer Brendan Gill, Michael Gates Gill was a creative director at J. Walter Thompson Advertising, where he was employed for over twenty-five years. He lives in New York within walking distance of the Starbucks store where he works, and has no plans to retire from what he calls the best job he&#x2019;s ever had.Michael Gates Gills story of being pushed out of an alpha male job and forced to work in a service job is both entertaining and compelling. Gills insecurities, class consciousness, and poor relationship with his self-absorbed father compounded his fall from high-flying marketing executive to retail grunt who found himself serving coffee to the kind of person he used to be. Most poignantly, his Starbucks job led to important life lessons through his experiences with African-Americans and others whom he says he looked down on in his previous career. With his pleasing elocution, sensitivity to nuances in dialogue, and obvious appreciation for the authors experiences, Dylan Baker carries the weight of this story without being heavy-handed with its morality lesson.

Based on Jim Magnuson&#x2019;s <i>Agate Hunting Made Easy</i> and featuring the professional rock photography of Carol Wood, this guide helps to turn agate hunts into successful ones. You'll learn to pick up on those clues valuable to beginners and experts alike: Learn the common agate features to look for, see what rough agates look like in the field, recognize the different varieties of Lake Superior agates, and identify the agate imposters that might fool you. The easy-to-use format means you&#x2019;ll quickly find what you need to know. Plus, the quick guide is much easier to use than laminated foldouts, and the tear-resistant pages help to make the book durable in the field.</p></p><p><p>Rock hounding is more than a hobby for author <b>Jim Magnuson</b>, it&#x2019;s a serious and rewarding avocation that helps him connect with nature. He has been an avid hunter and student of various gems, minerals, and fossils since his childhood, when he first began to hunt for stones in his native state of Illinois. In addition, Jim enjoys sharing his passion not only through showing and gifting some of his finds but also through writing, another lifelong interest. Throughout Jim&#x2019;s career as an Information Technology professional, he has developed his technical writing skills while creating new processes that reduce complexity and improve efficiency. These same skills proved to be invaluable as he set out to create a modern-day guide for beginning agate hunters. Jim is also a member of the Minnesota Mineral Club and enjoys attending other rock and mineral clubs as a way to further his learning and branch out into other types of agates, gemstones, and geology.</p> <p><b>Carol Wood</b> took up professional photography as a means of satisfying a lifelong passion for creating and sharing things of beauty. She has a keen eye for seeing perspectives in things that on the surface appear to be mundane or quite simple. Given her training and natural instincts for perspective and complementary lighting that enhances visual clarity, Carol is able to produce high-definition photographic images that enhance but don&#x2019;t distract from the given subjects. These skills are essential in providing a guidebook that novice agate hunters can use as a just-in-time visual reference guide. In addition to Carol&#x2019;s photographic pursuits, she also enjoys outdoor activities with her friends and family, especially activities that have both a mental and physical component. As a result, she has become an avid rock hound in her own right and has gradually built a collection of beautiful agates that adorn her home in northern Illinois. Carol&#x2019;s personal interest in the hobby has helped her to walk in the shoes of the beginning rock hound and thereby envision and create a photographic learning experience.</p></p><h2>The New Rules of Coffee: A Modern Guide for Everyone</h2><p><b>An illustrated guide to the essential rules for enjoying coffee both at home and in cafes, including tips on storing and serving coffee, coffee growing, roasting and brewing, plus facts, lore, and popular culture from around the globe.</b><br><br>This introduction to all things coffee written by the founders and editors of Sprudge, the premier website for coffee content, features a series of digestible rules accompanied by whimsical illustrations.

Humans have been enjoying it steadily since the sixteenth century, and its origin story goes back millennia. Chances are you grew up drinking it, and have memories of how everyone in your your family liked to take theirs&#x2014;cream or no cream, maybe honey, as a breakfast table staple or weekend afternoon snack with cookies. But in the last decade something special has happened to this age-old beverage: a new boom of quality and entrepreneurship (embodied by pioneering coffee companies like Stumptown and Blue Bottle) has been met by a great wave of public interest and enthusiasm, leading to an unmistakable new golden era for coffee lovers worldwide. Coffee tastes better and means more than it ever has. There have never been more ways to drink it and brew it, and coffee&#x2019;s place in our society gets bigger every day.<br><br>Wherever you live on the planet, chances are there&#x2019;s a new place serving coffee in your neighborhood. That&#x2019;s not an accident&#x2014;it&#x2019;s part of something much bigger.<br><br>Thus, <i>The New Rules of Coffee</i>. We hope this book can serve as a helpful primer to the wonders of modern coffee, while paying respects to the beverage&#x2019;s past and&nbsp;looking ahead to the future. Whether you&#x2019;re enjoying a pumpkin spice latte or a delicate AeroPress of rare, exotic Wush Wush (that&#x2019;s a coffee cultivar), it has never been a better time to be a coffee drinker&#x2014;and a coffee lover.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve spent the last decade at Sprudge reporting on coffee every day through stories big and small, from our homes in Portland, Oregon, and from cafes, coffee farms, and coffee festivals around the world. We work with hundreds of journalists all across the planet, chasing coffee stories wherever we can find them, and over the years, we&#x2019;ve learned a thing or two about coffee along the way. We&#x2019;re sharing everything with you in the pages that follow.<br><br>With these fifty-five rules, we&#x2019;re dishing it all to you: from advice and travel tips to background information on what coffee actually is and why it matters now more than ever. And while we&#x2019;re sure this book will be responsible for kicking off a new coffee obsession or two, we hope above all else that it brings you a little bit of satisfaction, a moment of enjoyment, a chance perhaps to laugh and wonder&#x2014;not unlike a nice cup of coffee.</p><h2>Devotions from the Kitchen Table</h2><p><p><strong>Taste and see God&#x2019;s goodness from the heart of your home&#x2014;the kitchen table.</strong></p><p>A simple meal shared around a table.

In one clarifying and readable volume, the whole story of communism is graphically told and includes the tragic histories of China, Korea, Russia, the UN, Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley, General MacArthur, and others. National broadcaster Paul Harvey at CBS said, "I have never given any volume such an unqualified endorsement."<br><br><i>The Naked Communist</i> contains a distillation of more than one hundred books and treatises on communism, many written by Marxist authors. This text that reviewers have called "the most powerful book on communism since J. Edgar Hoover's <i>Masters of Deceit</i>"sees the communist as he sees himself - stripped of propaganda and pretense. Readers are offered an explanation of the appeal of communism, its history, its basic and unchanging concepts - even its secret timetable of conquest.<br><br>Among the many questions it answers are:<br>* Who gave the United States' nuclear secrets to the Russians?<br>* How did the FBI fight communism after it was forced underground in 1918?<br>* Why did the West lose 600 million allies after World War II?<br>* What really happened in Korea?<br>* What is communism's great secret weapon?<br>* Is there an answer to communism?<br>* What lies ahead?<br>* What can I do to stop communism?<br>* How can we stop communism without a major war?<br><br>**This is for the classic edition of <i>The Naked Communist. </i>For the updated version with a section about The Making of <i>The Naked Communist</i> and an update on the 45 Communist Goals search for ISBN 978-1630720797 (Hardback) and&nbsp; 978-0910558808 (Paperback).</p><p>W. Cleon Skousen (1913-2006) was a world-renowned teacher, lecturer and scholar whose books on freedom, the Constitution and communism sold in the millions. He earned his Juris Doctorate at George Washington University, served 16 years in the FBI, was Chief of Police in Salt Lake City, and was a popular university teacher. He gave thousands of seminars on the Constitution to several million across the U.S. and Canada including dozens of U.S. Senators and Representatives, two Supreme Court justices and several candidates for president. Among his 30+ books are the national best sellers The 5,000 Year Leap and The Naked Capitalist.

You will be alarmed, you will be informed and you'll be glad you heard him (W. Cleon Skousen).<br>-- <b>President Ronald Reagan, United States President</b><br><br>"I went back and I read '<i>The Naked Communist'</i> and at the end of that Skousen predicted [that] someday soon you won't be able to find the truth in schools or in libraries or anywhere else because it won't be in print anymore. So you must collect those books. It's an idea I read from Cleon Skousen from his book in the 1950s, '<i>The Naked Communist</i>,' and where he talked about someday the history of this country's going to be lost because it's going to be hijacked by intellectuals and communists and everything else. And I think we're there."<br><b>--Glenn Beck, Host of the </b><b>"Glenn Beck Radio Program"</b><br><br>"I feel certain that your efforts on this important subject (communism) will receive widespread attention and consideration."<br><b>--J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation</b><br><br>"<i>The Naked Communist</i> lays out the whole progressive plan. It is unbelievable how fast it has been achieved."<br><b>--Dr. Ben Carson, The Sean Hannity Show, May 23, 2014</b><br><br>"We believe in a moral code. Communism denies innate right or wrong. As W. Cleon Skousen has said in his timely book, <i>The Naked Communist</i>: The communist 'has convinced himself that nothing is evil which answers the call of expediency.' This is a most damnable doctrine. People who truly accept such a philosophy have neither conscience nor honor. Force, trickery, lies, broken promises are wholly justified."<br><b>-- Ezra Taft Benson, United States Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower</b></p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Probability and Statistics, 4th Edition: 897 Solved Problems + 20 Videos (Schaum&#39;s Outlines)</h2><p><p><b>Tough Test Questions?

Was he a national covenant maker like Moses, Abraham, Lehi, or Captain Moroni? Did he understand that he was fighting for the liberty of a promised land protected by God, a place where the Lord's holy temples could be built? <p><i>The Washington Hypothesis</i> explores the intriguing evidence that Washington and the other Founding Fathers knew the Lord had a greater purpose for America. It takes us on a fascinating historical journey through the miracles of the Revolutionary War to the foundational documents of this great nation to the symbolism evident in every corner of the nation's capital. Exploring what Washington believed and how his beliefs framed his every action, author Timothy Ballard draws compelling conclusions about the divinity of that great leader's calling. As we see the evidence of the Lord's hand in Washington's life and consider what we know about this promised land, we may discover a much greater design at work in the founding of our nation and thus a greater desire to strive to preserve those promised blessings.</p></p><p>Timothy Ballard graduated cum laude from Brigham Young University in Spanish and political science, then went on to receive an MA (summa cum laude) in international politics from the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

In the past decade, as our material existence and environmental footprint has grown exponentially, architects around the globe have become particularly interested in the possibilities of the minimal, low-impact, and isolated abode.</p><p>This Bibliotheca Universalis edition of Cabins combines insightful text, rich photography, and bright, contemporary illustrations by Marie-Laure Cruschi to show how this particular architectural type presents special opportunities for creative thinking. In eschewing excess, the cabin limits actual spatial intrusion to the bare essentials of living requirements, while in responding to its typically rustic setting, it foregrounds eco-friendly solutions. The cabin comes to showcase some of the most inventive and forward-looking practices of contemporary architecture, with Renzo Piano, Terunobu Fujimori, Tom Kundig, and many fresh young professionals all embracing such distilled sanctuary spaces.</p><p>The book showcases the variety of cabins in use and geography. From an artist studio on the Suffolk coast in England to eco-home huts in the Western Ghats region of India, this collection is as exciting in its international reach as it is in its array of briefs, clients, and situations. Constant throughout, however, is architectural innovation, and an inspiring sense of contemplation and coexistence as people return to nature and to a less destructive model of being in the world.</p></p><p>Philip Jodidio studied art history and economics at Harvard, and edited Connaissance des Arts for over 20 years.

Interoception enables us to experience essential feelings such as hunger, fullness, thirst, itch, pain, body temperature, nausea, need for the bathroom, tickle, physical exertion and sexual arousal. Additionally, interoception allows us to feel our emotions. As with other sensory systems, the interoceptive system can be impacted in individuals with conditions such as autism, trauma, anxiety, depression, ADHD and eating disorders. Interoception is a hot topic in research fields, however, up until this point, little has been discussed about interoception in the practical treatment of these conditions. </p> <p>Interoception: The Eighth Sensory System provides a detailed connection between interoception and common experiences of individuals with these and similar conditons. &#x201c;Mahler provides research and practical strategies that can be easily implemented across the lifespan to help individuals manage their bodies, emotions and self-regulation&#x201d; (Brenda Myles, PhD).</p> <p>The research showing just how important interoception is to many aspects of life is unequivocal. Interoception: The Eighth Sensory delivers an overview of this research and describes the clear link between interoception and important skill areas such as self- awareness, self-regulation, problem solving, social intuition, perspective taking and many more.</p></p><p>Kelly Mahler, MS, OTR/L, is a pediatric occupational therapist in the Central Pennsylvania region. She specializes in the development of self-regulation and social cognition skills. Additionally, Kelly is co-founder of Destination Friendship which is an organization providing fun, community-based opportunities targeted at developing friendship skills in children, adolescents, and teenagers with ASD.

She has presented at numerous national, state and local conferences. Kelly resides with her family in York, PA.When Kelly first mentioned the concept of interoception, a light bulb went off. This was a missing piece that people should have been discussing in the field of ASD.... Many individuals with ASD ... cannot label how something feels internally. The research that has gone into this book is superb, and it must be read by any professional, parent, or service provider who seeks to provide better services for an individual with ASD. --Kerry Mataya, author of Successful Problem-Solving for High-Functioning Students With Autism Spectrum Disorders.<br><br>The connection between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and interoception is essential to understanding and supporting learners on the spectrum. This innovative, groundbreaking book presents new information that will help family members, individuals on the spectrum, and those who support them understand the important rol of interoception in ASD. Mahler provides research and practical strategies that can be easily implemented across the lifespan to help individuals manage their bodies, emotions, and self-regulation. --Brenda Myles, PhD, consultant with the Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence (OCALI) and the Ziggurat Group<br><br>Kelly Mahler has managed to clearly explain a range of research on interoception and how this links to the experience, awareness, and expression of emotions for those on the autism spectrum. The practical assessments and strategies provided are easy to understand will be applicable both at home and in schools/preschools. This book explores the link between interoception, sensory difficulties, and self-regulation and the autism spectrum. Example from autistic children and young people enable the reader to understand this complex concept and see the benefit of applying the strategies described to increase interoceptive awareness in any person that struggles in this area. As an autism consultant and adviser, I can see how useful this book could be within homes and schools and look forward to a growing understanding of the role of interoception in autistic achievemen. --Dr. Emma Goodall, PhD, MA, BEd Hons, Dip Mont</p><h2>North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide To Edible And Inedible Fungi (Falconguide)</h2><p><i>North American Mushrooms</i> is a field guide to more than 600 edible and inedible mushrooms that can be found across the United States and Canada.

In this magically illustrated story the young girl Miyuki, who we first met in the critically acclaimed <em>Time for Bed, Miyuki</em>, anxiously awaits the opening of one sleepy flower. When, on the first day of spring, the flower still hasn't bloomed, Miyuki begins a frantic search for water to wake it up. Her grandfather gently encourages her to sit and watch with him, as she learns the important lesson that good things come to those who wait.</p><p>Prize-winning writer, poet, and children's book author Roxane Marie Galliez has a doctorate in the history of ancient civilizations and traveled the Pacific Islands for several years as a researcher and journalist. She lives near Saint-Etienne, France.<br><br>A graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, illustrator and painter Seng Soun Ratanavanh lives outside Paris, France."Galliez's lively, descriptive text pairs nicely with Ratanavanh's bright, graphic illustrations that feature bold floral patterns in red, yellow, and green as well as iconic Japanese objects such as the swan. Throughout, natural elements such as flowers, rushing water, insects, birds, and more appear prominently both in the foreground and the background, and Ratanavanh plays a bit with perspective as well-sometimes Miyuki appears quite small next to a giant frog and a big white rabbit. Eager young readers will find a kindred spirit in eager Miyuki." <br> - Kirkus Reviews<br><br>STARRED REVIEW "Bursting with enthusiasm at the first signs of spring, Miyuki ignores her grandfather's reminders to be patient and wanders far from home in search of the purest water to entice a promising bud to blossom. The book's springtime scenes, lucky cats, and colorful yukata in origami paper patterns pay cheerful tribute to traditional Japanese style and customs. It's destined to be a modern classic." <br> - Foreword Reviews</p><h2>Critical Care: A New Nurse Faces Death, Life, and Everything in Between</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Among all the recent books on medicine, <em>Critical Care</em> stands alone.&#x201c; &#x2014; Pauline Chen, author of <em>Final Exam</em> </p><p>&#x201c;A must read for anyone who wants to understand healthcare.

Brown, a former English professor at Tufts University, chronicles here her first year as an R.N. in medical oncology. As she does so, Brown illuminates the unique role of nurses in health care, giving us a deeply moving portrait of the day-to-day work nurses do: caring for the person who is ill, not just the illness itself.</p><p><em>Critical Care</em> takes us with Brown as she struggles to tend to her patients' needs, both physical (the rigors of chemotherapy) and emotional (their late-night fears). Along the way, we see the work nurses do to fight for their patients' dignity, in spite of punishing treatments and an often uncaring hospital bureaucracy. We also see how a twelve-hour day of caring for the seriously ill gives Brown herself a deeper appreciation of what it means to be alive. Ultimately, this is a book about embracing life, whether in times of sickness or health.</p><p>As she takes us into the place where patients and nurses meet, Brown shows us the power of human connection in the face of mortality.

He pushed back his chair. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it for tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the next studio, through the glass wall, they could see the national news anchorman, Richard Kramer, on the air. Delaney knew that Don was in line to take that spot when Kramer retired. She got up, left the studio, stopped in her office and changed from the purple blouse to a yoga top. She had been substituting for the usual co-anchor, Stephanie Lewis, who had called in sick. Delaney was especially happy that she was covering the Betsy Grant trial. It&#x2019;s going to be fascinating, she thought.<br> <br>She picked up her shoulder bag and, responding to a series of &#x201c;See you Delaney&#x2019;s,&#x201d; walked down several long corridors and onto Columbus Circle.<br> <br>Much as she loved summer, Delaney knew she was ready for autumn. After Labor Day, Manhattan takes on vibrancy, she thought, and then realized she was trying to distract herself from what was bothering her. The feature about the adoption had ripped open the walls that she had always tried to build around herself to keep the same subject from haunting her again.<br> <br>She needed to find her birth mother. James and Jennifer Wright had adopted her when she was hours old, and their names were on her birth certificate. She had been born with a midwife in attendance. The woman who had arranged the adoption was dead. There was no trace of the name of the midwife. Her birth had been registered in Philadelphia.<br> <br>It was a seemingly dead end. But she knew she was going to make a decision. She had heard about a retired detective who specialized in tracing the untraceable in cases like hers. She was so deep in thought as she began her one-mile walk home that, almost without noticing, she passed Fifth Avenue.<br> <br>At 54th Street she turned east. Her apartment in one of the older buildings was next to the one where Greta Garbo, the legendary actress from the 1930s had once resided. Garbo&#x2019;s famous quote, &#x201c;I &#x2018;vant&#x2019; to be alone,&#x201d; often ran through Delaney&#x2019;s mind at the end of a particularly frantic day at the studio.<br> <br>The always-smiling doorman, Danny, opened the door for her. Her apartment was a generous three rooms but certainly a vast difference from the large and beautiful home where she had been raised in Oyster Bay, Long Island. She dropped her bag, took a Perrier from the refrigerator, and, putting her feet on a hassock, settled in her comfortable chair.<br> <br>On the table directly across the room was a large family picture taken when she was three years old. She was sitting on her mother&#x2019;s lap next to her father. Her three brothers were lined up behind them. Her black curly hair and dark brown eyes so obviously leaped out of the so-called family picture. The others had several shades of reddish blonde hair. Their eyes were varying shades of light blue and hazel.<br> <br>It was a distinct memory. The first time she saw the picture she had begun to cry. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I look like all of you?&#x201d; she had wailed. That was when she was told that she was adopted. Not in those words, but as best as they could, her parents had explained to her, at that very young age, that they had very much wanted a little girl, and as a baby she had become part of their family.<br> <br>Last month in Oyster Bay there had been a big family reunion gathering for her mother&#x2019;s seventy-fifth birthday. Jim came in from Cleveland, Larry from San Francisco and Richard from Chicago, with their wives and children. It had been a truly happy time. Her mother and father were moving to Florida. They had given away the furniture they didn&#x2019;t need, telling Delaney and her brothers to pick out what they wanted. She had taken a few small pieces that fit in her apartment.<br> <br>She looked at the family picture again, visualizing the mother she had never known. Do I look like you? she wondered.<br> <br>The phone rang. Delaney raised her eyes to Heaven but then saw who was calling. It was Carl Ferro, the producer of the six o&#x2019;clock show. His voice was exultant. &#x201c;Stephanie took the job with NOW News. We&#x2019;re all thrilled. She was getting to be a &#x2018;royal,&#x2019;?&#x201d; he paused, &#x201c;?&#x2018;nuisance.&#x2019; She had the mistaken impression that she knew more than Kathleen.&#x201d; Kathleen Gerard was the executive producer of the News Department. &#x201c;Her resignation is coming in the morning. You&#x2019;re our new co-anchor with Don Brown. Congratulations!&#x201d;<br> <br>Delaney gasped. &#x201c;Carl, I&#x2019;m delighted! What else can I say?&#x201d; Then she added, &#x201c;My only regret is to miss covering the Grant trial.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We still want you to. We&#x2019;ll use rotating co-anchors until after the trial. You&#x2019;re a great reporter. This kind of trial is right up your alley.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t get any better than that, Carl. Thanks a lot,&#x201d; Delaney said.<br> <br>But as she put down the phone, she had a sudden disquieting moment. Her former nanny, Bridget O&#x2019;Keefe, had an expression, &#x201c;When things seem too good, there&#x2019;s trouble on the way.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Book of Hallowe&#39;en: The Origin and History of Halloween</h2><p><p>Since its original publication in 1919, Ruth Edna Kelley's THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN remains the all time classic exploration of Halloween history, from the mysterious year end rites of the ancient Celts, to the autumnal reign of Samhain, the Druid god of death, to the coming to Europe of Christianity and "All Saints Day," to the charming early 20th Century Halloween beliefs and customs of Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, France, Germany and America.

Every person, even the atheist, will admit that death is certain. Death, however, is not the last event in this life of ours. Immediately after death, we shall be judged and then again on the Day of Judgment when all humanity will know us for what we are.</p> <p>Too often the reality of Heaven and salvation are highlighted at the expense of the Church's teachings on Death, Judgment, Purgatory, and Hell. Yet, these important doctrines of the Church hold the truths of salvation truths that can lead us to Heaven or can pull us away from it.</p> <p>In these pages, Fr. Wade Menezes, EWTN television host and Assistant General of the Fathers of Mercy, shows us that God has not called us to His wrath, but to salvation. He shows us that Heaven and Hell, salvation and damnation, eternal life and eternal punishment are all complementary doctrines. They need each other to be complete and we must understand the Church's teachings on all of these doctrines in order to have a balanced view of the world.</p> <p>Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell these are the Four Last Things toward which we are moving each hour of the day and night. Read this book, and you'll have a firm grasp of one of the most important doctrines of Holy Mother Church that holds the truths of Heaven and our own salvation.</p></p><p><p>"In <i>The Four Last Things</i> Father Wade Menezes offers a wonderful guide to help us gauge our preparation for eternal life with God.

Baker, S.T.D.<br> Bishop of Birmingham, AL</b></p> <p> "By reminding us of the Four Last Things, Fr. Menezes summons us to hope for the ultimate good of spending eternity with God and reminds us of a proper fear to avoid condemnation in hell. He urges us to live this life with that love of God and neighbor that prepares us for eternal life of love, and to avoid all hatred, that would only prepare us for the isolating hatred in hell. Contemporary culture entertains itself with immortality if it includes hideous devouring zombies or beautiful blood-sucking vampires. Fr. Menezes calls us to the beauty of immortality in the image and likeness of God." <br> <b>Fr. Mitch Pacwa, SJ</b></p> <p>"We all wonder what will come when we draw our last breath of life, and in this profoundly important book Father Wade Menezes draws back the veil of mystery to give us insight and instruction about the ultimate <i>final four</i> death, judgment, heaven, hell. With skill and precision, he weaves together Sacred Scripture, Church teaching, and the wisdom of the saints to encourage us to strive for the ultimate prize life on high in Christ Jesus for all eternity.

From the windswept steppes of Mongolia to the sweltering desert of Dubai to the rooftop bars of Manhattan, this epic thriller weaves the global political events of the past twelve years into a tapestry so close to believable that it will leave you wondering where the line between fantasy and reality is drawn. The truth is, it is true. Inside of every good conspiracy is an even better idea. Inside such an idea would be a Herculean opportunity. The perfect global coup d'�tat would combine the brilliance of every conspiracy to pull off, but it is possible, and it has happened. The audacity of stealing all of the G-7 assets right out from under the noses of the world&#x2019;s self-proclaimed elite is so amazing it would not have to be hidden. No one would believe it. A conspiracy to overthrow those powerful men alleged to be the puppet masters of the world goes beyond the imagination of most, but not all. &#x2013; Leaving names like Rockefeller, Morgan, Kennedy, Rothschild, Oppenheimer, Blankfein, and Goldman scratching their heads would take genius, but it is not impossible. The plot leaves the rich and powerful wondering who in the hell had the audacity to actually use their hubris as the fulcrum to empty their collective pockets as well as their personal money machine of the Treasury of the United States. Best of all, and easiest of all is use the media &#x2013; novelists like Dan Brown; networks like CNN, FOX, al-Jazeera; and BBC; and Hollywood films &#x2013; to leak just enough of the truth to insure that the actual operation wouldn&#x2019;t require secrecy. If you convince people that what was really happening was an illusion created by the media, the truth could unfold and no one would believe it. It is a world wide conspiracy hatched in the dark back rooms playing out in the bright light of day. Praise for Coup d&#x2019;Twelve &#x201c;Compelling...! Martin&#x2019;s book is prophetic. The truth shall set you free? You honestly don&#x2019;t want the truth! If you read only one book in your life, this is the one!&#x201d; - Frank X. Vitolo, Producer &amp; Actor If you liked The Matrix, Da Vinci Code, or the Bourne Identity then you are going to love Coup d'Twelve. The world is waking up and this book is like drinking Red Bull from a fire hose. We need to know that humans were meant to thrive. We need to know that there is a global agenda in place that seeks to maximize gain for the few at the expense of the many. We need to remember that the most powerful force in the universe is the power of human creativity. We also need to remember that we are at one of the most critical moments in human history and this book is part of the tipping point towards a new global renaissance of human thriving.

University of Kent at Canterbury. <br> Uncle Tom's Cabin is the most popular, influential and controversial book written by an American. Stowe s rich, panoramic novel passionately dramatises why the whole of America is implicated in and responsible for the sin of slavery, and resoundingly concludes that only 'repentance, justice and mercy' will prevent the onset of 'the wrath of Almighty God!'.</p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.Uncle Tom, Topsy, Sambo, Simon Legree, little Eva: their names are American bywords, and all of them are characters in Harriet Beecher Stowe's remarkable novel of the pre-Civil War South. <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> was revolutionary in 1852 for its passionate indictment of slavery and for its presentation of Tom, "a man of humanity," as the first black hero in American fiction. Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work -- exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward "the peculiar institution" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families "sold down the river." An immediate international sensation, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> sold 300,000 copies in the first year, was translated into thirty-seven languages, and has never gone out of print: its political impact was immense, its emotional influence immeasurable.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Elementary Drum Method</h2><p>A complete drum method containing the elementary principles of music and an introduction to bass drum and cymbals.</p><p></p><h2>Madeline and the Bad Hat</h2><p><b>&#x201c;</b><i>In an old house in Paris</i><br><i> that was covered with vines</i><br><i> lived twelve little girls</i><br><i> in two straight lines</i><br><i> the smallest one was Madeline.</i><b>&#x201d; </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing frightens Madeline&#x2014;not tigers, not even mice.

Can she and Pepito ever get along?&nbsp;<br><br> Ludwig Bemelmans (1898-1962) was the author of the beloved Madeline books, including <i>Madeline</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book, and <i>Madeline's Rescue</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal.</p><p>One day the Spanish ambassador moves into the Parisian house next door to Miss Clavel, Madeline, and her 11 classmates. And, His Excellency has a boy! Pepito, as he is named, is not just any boy: according to Madeline, he is a "bad hat"--for starters, he's equipped with an irksome slingshot, he "ghosts," and he boasts. And when Miss Clavel gives him a box of tools to function as an "outlet for his energy," he makes a guillotine for the cook's chickens. ("He ate them ROASTED, GRILLED, AND FRITO! Oh what a horror was PEPITO.") Children will love Ludwig Bemelmans's jaunty rhymes and simple, evocative drawings, and the ferocity with which the feisty Madeline suspects, condemns, and rebuffs the boisterous new boy neighbor. In the end, however, everything comes out right, and we, along with Miss Clavel, can relax.

The uneven power dynamic can mess with your head and make you approach conversations far more delicately than you need to, or even convince you not to have the conversation at all.<br><br>But for the most part, you&#x2019;ll get the best results if you approach your boss as if she&#x2019;s a normal human, not royalty or a terrible ogre. That&#x2019;s sometimes easier said than done, though, so here are some general operating instructions to follow:<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t overthink it. Overthinking will cause you a lot more stress and anxiety than is probably warranted and it&#x2019;s likely to make you less effective, too. You&#x2019;ll wind up dancing around the issue, or using formal wording that sounds odd and unclear. Just be direct and straightforward.<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your ego at bay. The more you can approach the conversation from an emotionally detached place, the more effective you&#x2019;re likely to be. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that you can&#x2019;t have emotions; it just means that you can&#x2019;t let them drive the conversation. For example, if your boss gives you some critical feedback and you get defensive or upset, you&#x2019;re less likely to truly process the guidance she&#x2019;s giving you. Instead, calmly ask for more information and talk through your options. That should lead you away from defensive responses like &#x201c;No one told me not to do it that way!&#x201d; and toward more constructive responses like &#x201c;Would it be better to do X?&#x201d; or &#x201c;I think X is happening because of Y. Let me try Z and see if that solves it.&#x201d;<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think like a consultant. Employees&#x2019; relationships with their managers sometimes resemble a parent/child dynamic more than a peer-�to-�peer relationship&#x2014;�and that&#x2019;s not a good thing. To avoid that, try thinking of yourself as a consultant and your boss as your client. Consultants are able to sidestep that parent-�child dynamic because they&#x2019;re independently offering their services, and while they want to make their clients happy, if they ultimately can&#x2019;t see eye to eye on something important, they can part ways without a ton of drama. And really, that&#x2019;s true for employees, too&#x2014;�employees just tend to lose sight of it.<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you bring concerns to your boss, frame them from the perspective of &#x201c;What makes the most sense for the organization and why?&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;I want X.&#x201d; The former is the perspective that your boss will need to take, so it&#x2019;s better for both of you if the conversation starts there. However&nbsp;. . .<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If something really just comes down to &#x201c;I want X,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s okay to be straightforward about that. If you&#x2019;re in pretty good standing with your boss and you have some credibility built up (in part because you don&#x2019;t approach her with &#x201c;I want X&#x201d;-�type requests on a daily basis), then sometimes it&#x2019;s okay to say, &#x201c;I know that this doesn&#x2019;t sound like a big deal, but it&#x2019;s driving me crazy. Could we try doing X instead?&#x201d; or &#x201c;X is really important to me. Can we talk about whether there&#x2019;s any way to make that happen?&#x201d; Good bosses want to make good employees happy, so knowing what would make you happier is actually great information for them to have.<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make it clear that you understand that your boss may have different information or a different perspective than you. In many cases, your boss really will have more information than you do, and you should approach sensitive conversations with that in mind. For example, if you&#x2019;re concerned about why your boss moved a high-�profile project from you to your coworker, start by saying, &#x201c;I realize that there might be reasons for this that I&#x2019;m not privy to&#x201d; as opposed to just launching into &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really upset about losing this project.&#x201d; You&#x2019;ll have more credibility, and you won&#x2019;t put your boss on the defensive.<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases you&#x2019;ll get better results by asking for a short-�term experiment rather than a permanent change. If your boss is resistant to what you&#x2019;re asking for, suggesting a short-�term trial rather than a permanent change can be a good way to lower the stakes. For example, if you want to work from home on Thursdays and your boss isn&#x2019;t convinced it makes sense, she might agree more easily if you don&#x2019;t ask her to commit to it forever. Instead, say, &#x201c;Could we try it for the next three Thursdays and see how it goes? If it causes problems, of course I wouldn&#x2019;t continue. But it could be a good way to test it out.&#x201d; This approach works for all kinds of requests, from asking for more autonomy in your work to suggesting a different format for staff meetings.<br><br>1. Your boss seems unhappy with your work<br><br>Sometimes it&#x2019;s clear that your boss is unhappy with your work: You&#x2019;re getting a lot of critical feedback and/or she tells you directly that she&#x2019;s concerned. Other times, you might be less certain. Maybe you have a vague sense that she&#x2019;s dissatisfied without having anything concrete to point to, or you might not know whether the amount of criticism you&#x2019;re getting is par for the course or something to worry about.<br><br>In all these cases, the worst thing you can do is silently worry. You might think that raising the issue will make it worse, but really, if your boss has concerns about your performance, it&#x2019;s much better to know and to try to address the situation. If you avoid the topic, you won&#x2019;t ever know what you could be doing better. And you might be denying yourself peace of mind, too, if in fact your boss isn&#x2019;t as worried as you think.<br><br>So, name what you&#x2019;re worried about and ask for more insight. Here are some ways you can say it:<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the sense that you&#x2019;re concerned about how I&#x2019;m handling X and Y. If so, I&#x2019;d really like to talk it through with you and get your feedback.&#x201d;<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I might be misreading, but you seemed disappointed with how project X went. Could we talk about how you think it went?&#x201d;<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can I ask about some of the feedback you&#x2019;ve given me lately? I wasn&#x2019;t sure if this is the amount and type of feedback you&#x2019;d normally expect to give the person in my role, or if I&#x2019;m having a tougher time than you&#x2019;d generally expect.&#x201d;<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Could we talk about how things are going overall? I&#x2019;d �really like to get your feedback on how I&#x2019;m doing, in the big picture.&#x201d;<br><br>2. The job isn&#x2019;t what you agreed to<br><br>If you find yourself in a new job that&#x2019;s significantly different from the one you signed up for, you should speak up. First, if you don&#x2019;t speak up, your boss may not even realize this is happening; he may be so busy with other things that he hasn&#x2019;t fully focused on what&#x2019;s going on with you. Second, you want to find out whether you&#x2019;re just pinch-�hitting for someone else short-�term (maybe until someone has time to train you on your primary responsibilities or until something else changes) or this is what the job will look like long-�term. And third, you need to be clear that you&#x2019;re not okay with doing a different job than the one you signed up for. (Don&#x2019;t assume that this is obvious.)<br><br>Start by saying something like this:<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Since I started a month ago, I&#x2019;ve been spending most of my time on database maintenance. Could we talk about the plan for getting the accounting work transferred over to me? I was happy to help out with the database because I know we were in a pinch with Niles being out, but I&#x2019;d r�eally like to focus on the accounting work I was hired for.&#x201d;<br><br>If your manager says that there are no immediate plans to make that happen, you could say:<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Would you be open to talking about handling it differently? I hadn&#x2019;t expected the job to be centered on database work when I took it, and it&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;d normally seek to make part of my role.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s possible that this conversation will make your manager realize that he needs a different plan&#x2014;�in which case, great, problem solved. But it&#x2019;s also possible that you&#x2019;ll hear, &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m sorry it worked out this way, but this is what we need from the role now.&#x201d; If that&#x2019;s the case, you&#x2019;ll need to decide if you want the job under these new terms. That&#x2019;s definitely not fair&#x2014;�but if it&#x2019;s the reality of the situation, it&#x2019;s better to figure that out sooner rather than later so that you can decide how you want to proceed.<br><br>3. You have concerns about a colleague&#x2019;s work<br><br>Let&#x2019;s say you have a coworker who isn&#x2019;t very good at her job. Her work is full of mistakes, or she doesn&#x2019;t return calls from her clients so they end up contacting you for help instead, or she&#x2019;s frequently late in finishing up her piece of a joint project.<br><br>A lot of people will tell you that if the problems aren&#x2019;t impacting your ability to do your own job, you should stay out of it. And sometimes that&#x2019;s true&#x2014;�if the problems are minor. But if the problems are significant and you can see that they&#x2019;re affecting your team or your organization, a good manager will appreciate a discreet heads-�up about what&#x2019;s going on.<br><br>Of course, &#x201c;significant&#x201d; is the key here. Your coworker coming in two minutes late every day probably doesn&#x2019;t meet that bar, but clients complaining that your coworker never responds to their calls probably does. The question to ask yourself is: How does this affect our work, and by how much? If it&#x2019;s more than mildly annoying and has a real impact on the work, a good boss will want to know about it.</p><h2>Tomie dePaola&#39;s Mother Goose</h2><p>"Bobby Shaftoe, Old Mother Hubbard, Simple Simon, Jack Sprat, Little Miss Muffet . . . they are all here, along with 200 others . . . From start to finish a treasure house of delight." --<em>Booklist</em> starred review <br><br>Tomie dePaola's collection of traditional rhymes is a visual treat for both children and parents. His cheerful, humorous style enlivens 200 rhymes that star both the familiar Mother Goose cast of characters and those not as well known. Some pages are devoted to one rhyme--including all the verses--while other pages feature a variety of shorter rhymes or thematic groupings (such as verses about weather). Amidst the nursery rhymes are American poems such as "Yankee Doodle" and "Hush Little Baby," along with traditional poems such as "Three Little Kittens." This collection is a delightful introduction to poetry as well as an entertaining, comprehensive Mother Goose book. Parents could read a few rhymes to younger children and longer segments to older preschoolers. Beginning readers who have grown up with this book will move naturally into reading Mother Goose on their own. (Ages 1-6)</p><p><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background. By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration.</p><p>Tomie dePaola has published almost 200 children's books in fifteen different countries. He remains one of the most popular creators of books for children, receiving more than 100,000 fan letters each year.</p><p>Tomie lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs.

Renowned Trial Lawyer, Co-Founder of Legal Zoom</p><p>What if you knew you could get what you want in negotiation? What if you knew you could feel powerful, confident and in control of the entire process? Top 1% attorney, author and media personality Rebecca Zung shares her proven method for successfully negotiating anything in her latest book, "Negotiate Like You MATTER: The Sure Fire Method to Step Up and Win" provides powerful and easy steps you can take to level up your business and your life! </p><p>Every single person wants to feel seen, heard, understood and know they MATTER. This is true in any human interaction, but in negotiations the stakes are higher. The outcome of a negotiation becomes an outward measurement of our value, and if you haven't done your internal growth work, then at the deepest, darkest level, a "loss" in negotiations feels like YOU are less, not just that you RECEIVED less. That risk of vulnerability is often not worth the potential gain. Using her years of experience in litigating divorces for the world's most powerful people, attorney Rebecca Zung shares, through easy to understand language and humorous stories, the exact steps to the secret of how to get what you want. A totally innovative approach to negotiation, she blends the worlds of self-help, quantum physics, and body language with all the more traditional negotiation skills, strategies, tactics and techniques.</p><p>80% of winning a negotiation happens before you even walk into the room. To properly prepare, you must move from your inside out. This means that you must start from dealing with your own internal dialogue and knowing you have value. Next, you move to the external preparations. This means doing the research, preparing the arguments, creating leverage, discovering pain points, determining the best and worst case scenarios, doing risk analysis, deciding where the negotiations should be, what to wear, and what your first offer will be. The final step is the actual negotiation itself. Here you must prepare for how to command the entire process by determining how to walk into the room, how to greet the other person, how to use powerful body language (and read the other side's), how to present your offer, how to use embedded commands and mirroring, and much more. The methodology in this book works no matter what field you are in, and regardless of how powerful the other side is.</p><p>Throughout the book, you'll be given easy to remember mnemonics, catchy phrases, tools, resources and exercises, all to remember exactly what to do to win every negotiation, in any situation, every time - and have the other side be happy about it. Get ready to feel empowered, inspired and actually look forward to negotiating!</p><p> </p></p><p>Rebecca Zung is one of the Top 1% of attorneys in the nation, having been recognized by U.S. News &amp; World Report as a "Best Lawyer in America", as "Legal Elite" by Trend Magazine, and recognized by her peers and the judiciary as AV(c), preeminent rated in family law, the highest possible rating for an attorney by Martindale Hubbell.

The nerve endings would go dead for twenty or thirty minutes, like I&#x2019;d woken up on a limb that fell asleep. Sometimes the fingers of my right hand lost sensation, and then a prickly blanket of numbness would spread to my wrist and up my arm. I could&#x2019;ve banged on my hand with a hammer and still felt nothing.</p><p>At first I thought there must be a simple explanation, like a pinched nerve. I was twenty-eight years old, with no history of serious illness. But when the episodes became more frequent, I got the name of a neurologist in Manhattan and made an appointment.</p><p>Sitting in the dingy waiting room, I nervously flipped through a half-dozen dog-eared magazines, hoping to take in some news from the real world. It was mostly bad. Bombings in Istanbul, suicide attacks in Iraq, the passing of Johnny Cash.</p><p>A nurse called me to the reception window and handed me a stack of forms to fill out. Name, age, height, and weight were easy--Scott Charles Harrison, twenty-eight, six foot one, and a slim 170 pounds, thanks to a steady diet of Marlboro Reds--but the long list of questions about my lifestyle wasn&#x2019;t so simple. Looking through the packet, I realized that I didn&#x2019;t dare answer truthfully, lest the doctors think the presentable college grad in front of them was some kind of degenerate.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you smoke cigarettes? (Two to three packs a day. Is that too much?)</p><p>Do you consume alcohol? How many drinks per day? (Up to ten drinks, but I try not to mix. My current favorites, in order: Champagne, beer, and vodka and Red Bull.)</p><p>Do you use recreational drugs? If so, how frequently? (Well, that really depends on how much I&#x2019;ve had to drink. Cocaine, two to three times a week; Ambien to come down; MDMA whenever I can get my hands on it.)</p><p>Anyone who knew the full extent of my partying would&#x2019;ve said it was no wonder I was finally having health problems. But I&#x2019;d come here for a brain scan and a quick diagnosis, not a lecture. And the fact was, getting wasted every night was my job.</p><p>For the last ten years, I&#x2019;d climbed the ranks of New York nightlife to become one of the top club promoters in the city. Most nights, you&#x2019;d find me at the hottest party in town, sitting at the owner&#x2019;s table with beautiful women, drinking expensive Champagne (or occasionally spraying it), and looking like the guy who had it all. And for a while, I did.</p><p>I was making about $200,000 a year but living like a millionaire, thanks to the perks. The place I called home was a big, industrial Midtown loft with a baby grand piano in the living room, a killer stereo system, and a private rooftop patio. Bacardi and Budweiser each paid me $2,000 a month just to be seen drinking their brands in public. On my wrist, I wore a Rolex Oyster Perpetual, which I loved to flash at club photographers with a knowing smirk. The watch had been a gift from my then-girlfriend, a nineteen-year-old Danish model whose face graced the covers of Vogue and Elle.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t always lived like this. Ten years earlier, when I moved to the city and began collecting these superficial markers of success, one of my first mentors in nightlife said, &#x201c;Scott, you&#x2019;re too nice. If you&#x2019;re going to do this right, you need to be seen out every night, spending money, with a hot model on your arm.&#x201d;</p><p>Mission accomplished. But somewhere along the way, the sameness of nightlife--booze, drugs, girls, repeat--made me restless. I wanted change, and the more things stayed the same, the more booze, drugs, and girls I&#x2019;d needed to force my mind and body to show up for work with a smile. It&#x2019;s like what Ernest Hemingway said about going bankrupt: It happened gradually, then suddenly. For me, &#x201c;suddenly&#x201d; would involve a gun, a bottle of Scotch, and a cobalt-blue Mustang. But that comes later.&nbsp;</p><p>Over several weeks in the fall of 2003, I endured a battery of medical tests, searching for the cause of my numbness. Technicians examined my brain and spinal cord with an MRI and a CT scan, looking for possible culprits: tumors, blood clots, bone and tissue irregularities. Doctors put sensors on my arms and legs, monitoring the electrical activity from my brain to my muscles and nerves. Nurses stuck me with needles, drew blood, and ordered me to urinate in small plastic cups.</p><p>But in the end, all my tests came back normal. They couldn&#x2019;t find anything wrong with me. I was simply going numb.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s the cigarettes?&#x201d; I said to my business partner, Brantly Martin, as I fumbled to open my third pack of Reds for the day. We were on our way to a club.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try to cut down to two packs and chill on the booze?&#x201d; he offered.&nbsp;</p><p>We joked about it, but inside, I was gripped with a quiet certainty that I was dying of some terrible disease that the doctors and their tests had missed. I used to find humor in darkness. I even laughed in the face of death once. It was a few years back. I was high on ecstasy and trying to get a friend&#x2019;s attention, and I crashed my hands through the floor-to-ceiling windows of a building at New York University. The pane shattered into pieces, and shards of glass rained down, making cuts all over my face and hands. I bled all over the backseat of the cab on my way to the ER, but I couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing about it. I didn&#x2019;t care. At twenty-five, you think you&#x2019;re going to live forever. Until one day, you don&#x2019;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Alone in my loft later that night, I typed &#x201c;numbness&#x201d; into Google, trying to self-diagnose my condition. Trying to find a solution that the doctors couldn&#x2019;t. There, high in the results, among the generic medical advice, I was surprised to see a religious essay. I clicked the link and got lost in a sermon about spiritual numbness, about how one&#x2019;s conscience can become seared to the point where it no longer works. Near the end of the sermon, the author asked, &#x201c;Are you right with God?&#x201d;</p><p>As a child, I&#x2019;d heard that question a hundred times from the pulpit, but now it filled me with existential terror. I wondered what would happen if I actually died. Would a childhood full of fervent bedtime prayers, Bible study, and church band still count? I wasn&#x2019;t so sure. I turned off my computer and climbed into bed, my right arm still tingling like a pincushion being poked by a thousand needles.&nbsp;</p><p>My father&#x2019;s worried voice filled my head. &#x201c;Please pray for our son. He&#x2019;s gone prodigal,&#x201d; Dad would tell his friends at church.&nbsp;</p><p>It was true. When I left home at nineteen, I&#x2019;d turned my back on faith, virtue, and just about everything else that mattered most to Chuck and Joan Harrison. I still called my parents every few weeks, though. Mom would always ask about my spiritual life. Dad would ask how the nightlife business was going, and then he&#x2019;d pass along words of wisdom from the Bible, trying to reignite my interest in faith. &#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say, before changing the subject. That&#x2019;s how our conversations went for almost ten years. But now, at twenty-eight, although I&#x2019;d never have admitted it to my father, I knew I had to change.</p><p>Just start over, I&#x2019;d think to myself. Do something different with your life.</p><p>But I was too numb to make a move. And what would I do, anyway? You don&#x2019;t just leave nightlife and become a successful doctor or lawyer or banker. I felt trapped in the shallow end of the pool.</p><p>And so, every night, I&#x2019;d snort another line of cocaine and pass the rolled-up bill to another pretty girl and think to myself, This is not who I am. This is not who I want to be. This is not how I thought my life would turn out.</p><p><br>2</p><p>Poison</p><p>Moorestown, New Jersey, January 1980<br><br></p><p>On New Year&#x2019;s Day 1980, my mother collapsed in her bedroom, unconscious. I was four years old and asleep in my own room, so I have no memory of my father lifting her to her feet as she briefly regained consciousness and then passed out again.</p><p>It would take another year before my parents figured out what was wrong with her, twelve more months before they learned that an invisible gas was spreading throughout our two-story Colonial home, robbing Mom&#x2019;s body of oxygen and vitality.</p><p>Long-term, low-level exposure to carbon monoxide works like a steady drip of poison, with symptoms so subtle that doctors miss it all the time. For Mom, the effects came in the form of nausea; tight, throbbing headaches; and muscles that were too sore to lift a coffee cup. She figured she had the flu or was stressed out from having set up our new home.</p><p>We&#x2019;d moved to Moorestown two months earlier so that my dad, Chuck, a sales manager for a manufacturing company, could shorten his one-hour commute to twenty-two minutes. The drab gray house wasn&#x2019;t love at first sight, but my parents liked that it was on a cul-de-sac in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood, and that there was a respected elementary school at the end of the block. Pragmatism won out.</p><p>My mom, Joan, thrives on order. She wanted everything to be perfect in time for Christmas, so she spent weeks inside our polluted house, unpacking, organizing, and hanging paintings on the walls. When she passed out on the floor, Dad called our neighbor, Dr. Joe Winston. He gave Mom a physical exam, and she scheduled a series of appointments with an infectious disease specialist and an allergist. They discovered that she was mildly allergic to mold and pollen, but they couldn&#x2019;t find anything to explain the fatigue, soreness, or dizziness she was feeling. She kept looking for answers.</p><p>In the back of her mind, Mom wondered if chasing after me was just tiring her out. After all, ever since I learned to walk and talk, I&#x2019;d been a strong-willed, curious kid with fast legs, a loud mouth, and boundless energy. Mom still tells the story about the time she took me with her to the bakery and I stuck my fingers into a fruit pie to find out if it tasted as good as it looked. She apologized to the baker and bought the pie. Next, we went to a bookstore, where I ripped the pages from a pop-up book. She bought the book. Next stop, a hardware store, where she rescued me seconds before I whipped a chainsaw off the shelf. That was the last time she took me shopping for a while.</p><p>The medical tests continued all throughout the spring, summer, and fall. But by winter, Mom was still sick and getting sicker. One day, she almost passed out making me oatmeal on the gas stove. Every time the heater in our house fired up, her heart would race.</p><p>&#x201c;Joan, you do seem to feel better when you&#x2019;re outside,&#x201d; Dr. Winston said after reviewing another batch of inconclusive test results. &#x201c;I wonder if something inside your house is making you sick?&nbsp;</p><p>That clue sent Dad to the library to do research on indoor pollution. He called the Environmental Protection Agency, and spent hours talking to experts about asbestos, formaldehyde, radon, and other common household pollutants. He had the gas company inspect our furnace, stove, and water heater. A chimney expert examined the fireplace flue. But everything checked out okay.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening to me, Chuck?&#x201d; Mom asked Dad one night in despair. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a year, and I&#x2019;m only getting worse. I&#x2019;m scared.&#x201d; My dad, forever the optimist, is a consummate problem solver, but nothing he tried was helping her. Pretty soon his coworkers started questioning her illness. &#x201c;Some women don&#x2019;t take to change well,&#x201d; they told him. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s probably just upset with you about having to move.&#x201d;</p><p>Another colleague put it more bluntly: &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s all in her head.&#x201d;</p><p>If you ask Dad what first drew him to Mom, he&#x2019;ll grin and tell you, &#x201c;Her long legs.&#x201d; In the summer of 1967, Dad spotted a pretty girl in a miniskirt at a party and walked up to introduce himself.&nbsp;</p><p>Mom took one look at the dark-haired naval officer in the crisp white uniform and knew exactly what she wanted. A few dates later, Joan Kleppinger informed her mother that she&#x2019;d met the man she was going to marry. Chuck Harrison possessed all her &#x201c;must-haves&#x201d; for a husband. He was ambitious, smart, educated, tall, and good-looking. His sense of humor, she said, was a bonus.</p><p>At twenty-four years old, Mom had just earned a master&#x2019;s degree in English. She was kind and caring, smart but gullible, and easy to bring to laughter--the kind of girl who remains a virgin until her wedding night. Dad was twenty-six, a hard-drinking, hard-smoking former naval officer who served on a 370-foot U.S. Navy destroyer while putting himself through business school. They dated for a year, spending Thanksgiving with Mom&#x2019;s family and Christmas with Dad&#x2019;s. By New Year&#x2019;s Eve, Mom had practically picked out her wedding dress.</p><p>They got married in August of the next year, 1968, in a candlelight service. Mom walked down the aisle in a simple bridesmaid gown, arm in arm with her father. Mendelssohn&#x2019;s Wedding March filled the chapel. Traditional music, followed by traditional vows.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, to love her in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, until death do you part?&#x201d; the minister said.</p><p>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Dad said, never taking his eyes off Mom--not knowing just how fiercely this vow would be tested.&nbsp;</p><p>Seven years later, on September 7, 1975, I came along, and then we were three. On the night I was born, Dad wasn&#x2019;t content to sit on the sidelines. Instead, he stood by Mom&#x2019;s side, watching the fetal monitor and coaching her through the contractions.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, now . . .&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Okay. You&#x2019;re almost at the top. You&#x2019;ve got it now! There you go!&#x201d; The nurses called Dad the Howard Cosell of the delivery room.</p><p>At the time, Mom had been working as a feature writer and photographer for a suburban Philly newspaper, but she felt torn about going back to work. While second-wave feminism swept through the country and Time magazine awarded its 1975 Man of the Year cover to &#x201c;American Women,&#x201d; Mom decided this wasn&#x2019;t her fight. She told my dad, &#x201c;Jobs can wait, babies can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>I can tell from family photo albums that this was the happiest time for her. She took me to the zoo and the children&#x2019;s museum, to parks and family gatherings. I don&#x2019;t have the memories to call upon, but I know that these were the only years in my life when Mom got to be a normal parent.</p></p><h2>Invading Babylon: The 7 Mountain Mandate</h2><p><p><b>You were transformed to transform your world!</b></p> <p>For too long, Christianity has been defined by a false concept of church.

He reflects on the power of the Trinity in our lives, the meaning of knowledge, the importance of spiritual disciplines and much more. Dallas Willard offers poignant thoughts about what it will be like to transition into the very presence of Christ in heaven. Now in paperback, this book is adapted from the talks given at the February 2013 Dallas Willard Center "Knowing Christ Today" conference in Santa Barbara, California. Each chapter is followed with an illuminating dialogue between Dallas Willard and John Ortberg. The book closes with the theme of offering a blessing to one another. These reflections form an apt conclusion to Dallas Willard's public ministry. It is a gift of grace. A conversation guide written by Gary W. Moon is included. Also available is the companion <em>Living in Christ's Presence DVD.</em></p><p>Dallas Willard (1935&#x2013;2013) was a professor in the School of Philosophy at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. A highly influential author and teacher, Willard was as celebrated for his enduring writings on spiritual formation as he was for his scholarship. His books include <em>The Divine Conspiracy</em>, <em>The Spirit of the Disciplines</em> and <em>Hearing God</em>."My soul grew reading this book. Or perhaps more precisely, my soul grew as this book read me." (Lee Eclov, Leadership Journal 2015 Book Awards, Winter 2015)<br><br>"<em>Living in Christ's Presence</em> is a superb discussion of the many issues surrounding the reality of life in the kingdom of God here and now. I recommend it highly." (Richard J. Foster, author of Celebration of Discipline, Streams of Living Water and Sanctuary of the Soul)<br><br>"I actually think the best moments with Dallas are in Q and A sessions where you can get that wisdom in kind of bite-sized chunks that all of us are able to access and absorb. So they opportunity to do that, to just sit in a chair with him and say 'Hey, Dallas,' and ask him those questions and see what happened in the moment, and he?ll get this little sly glint in his eye, and then he?ll just drop these statements on you that literally could not come from anybody else, partly because of his mind and partly because of his heart. "I've known Dallas for about 25 years, and he has impacted me like nobody else has. His writings, his book <em>Spirit of the Disciplines</em>&#x2015;outside of the Bible has had the biggest impact on my life. And so the chance to do this conference together was really powerful. Then when he got sick and it was clear that barring a miracle he was not going to be on earth for a real long time, it took on a whole added dimension of substance. We actually thought about, just given his health, should we not do the conference? And Dallas said, 'Nope, I want to do it. There are things that need to be said, and this is the chance to say it.'" (John Ortberg, senior pastor of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church and author of Soul Keeping)<br><br>"When I finished the book, I experienced a joy as deep and wide as the love of God in Christ. How many books can you say that about? Thanks, Dallas Willard, for a life well lived." (Randy Harris, The Christian Chronicle, September 2014)<br><br>"Touching on many topics . . . Willard and Ortberg's collaboration here is devotional gift. It is also a compass for finding one's way through the shadows to a life lived in the kingdom with God. An essential for your library, liberally furnishing inspiration for pastors, teachers, and songwriters." (Andrea Hunter, Worship Leader Magazine, March/April 2014)<br><br>"Willard shares in his last book insights about the process of transforming a person into Christlikeness, the gift of stepping into the kingdom, the challenge to become a person of blessing, and more. Ortberg discusses the primacy of learning from Jesus how to live in the kingdom, the connection between the Trinity and community, the distinction between training and trying in regard to spiritual disciplines, and more. Their talks complement and build on each other."

And there were those hits: &#x201c;Wild One,&#x201d; &#x201c;Volare,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Forget Him,&#x201d; to name a few. He was far more than just a teen idol. Bobby&#x2019;s voice and boy next door charm earned him a spot singing, acting, and dancing with Ann-Margret in the film adaptation of the hit musical comedy, Bye Bye Birdie. His comedic talents made him a nighttime fixture during the golden age of TV variety shows, and his phrasing and musicianship led to dozens of headlining gigs in the casino showrooms of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Frank Sinatra anointed him as his favorite pop singer of the early &#x2018;60s. But early success took a toll on his life. Bobby Rydell&#x2019;s brutally honest street corner narrative evolved during an eighteen-month collaboration with Allan Slutsky, the award-winning author and producer of the widely acclaimed book and documentary film, Standing in the Shadows of Motown. Inspiring, gut-busting, and, at times, heartbreaking, Teen Idol On The Rocks gives you a front row seat to the turbulent, six decade journey of one of rock and roll&#x2019;s earliest, and most celebrated teen idols.</p><p><b>Bobby Rydell</b>&nbsp;was the Justin Beiber of the early '60s.

His acting and comedic skills made him a fixture on dozens of TV variety shows (Red Skelton, Danny Thomas, Jack Benny, Perry Como, Ed Sullivan, etc.) and landed him the co-starring role with Ann-Margret in the smash film version of the Broadway musical,&nbsp;<b><i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>.</b>&nbsp;At the age of 74, Bobby continues to perform around the world as a solo act and with Frankie Avalon and Fabian in the Golden Boys.<b>Allan Slutsky</b>&nbsp;is a Grammy Award-winning musician, author and film producer best known for writing&nbsp;<b><i>Standing In The Shadows of Motown,</i></b>&nbsp;and producing the hit documentary film of the same title that was released in 2002. &nbsp;His&nbsp;<b>Doctor Licks</b>&nbsp;series of guitar books sold all over the world for throughout the '80s and '90s, and his musical arrangements have been played on&nbsp;<i>American Idol, the Tonight Show, the Emmys</i>, and numerous other TV productions."Pure rock 'n roll nostalgia with a big dose of personal memories that will tear your heart out. &nbsp;. . . . another reason to embrace him even more!"--<b><i>The Huffington Post</i></b><br><br>"No B.S. &nbsp;. . . . an autobiography laden with darkness and tragedy that would give even Keith Richards pause."--<b><i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></b><br>&nbsp;"A highly entertaining, deeply personal, sometimes painful rumination of a life lived in the spotlight." --<i><b>A.D.

Lily and her fierce-hearted black &#x201c;stand-in mother&#x201d; escape the racism of their hometown and find refuge with an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters, whose world of bees, honey, and the Black Madonna is mesmerizing.</p><p>In Sue Monk Kidd's <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i>, 14-year-old Lily Owen, neglected by her father and isolated on their Georgia peach farm, spends hours imagining a blissful infancy when she was loved and nurtured by her mother, Deborah, whom she barely remembers. These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words "Tiburon, South Carolina" scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed, <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i> is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"This is the story of a young girl's journey toward healing, and of finding, at its end, not only wholeness, but the intrinsic sacredness of living in the world. I think it is simply wonderful" (Anne Rivers Siddons) <p>"Sue Monk Kidd's eccentric, inventive, and ultimately forgiving novel is reminscent of the work of Reynolds Price in its ability to create a truly original Southern voice." (Anita Shreve) </p><p>"I am amazed that this moving, original, and accomplished book is a first novel. It is wonderfully written, powerful, poignant, and humorous, and takes a line which is -- refreshingly -- strongly female without being cliche-feminist. It is also deliciously eccentric, which lifts it out of the usual category of a rite-of-passage novel into the realms of real distinction. DO read it." (Joanna Trollope) </p><p>"What a splendid novel! It's wonderfully thoughtful and sensitive and <i>compulsively</i> readable." (Susan Isaacs) </p><p>"The Secret Life of Bees is a novel of love and almost unbelievable courage, the quest of one young girl in search of her mother and so much more. Sue Monk Kidd takes on huge things, and by writing about what is mysterious, even difficult, in life, illuminates what is beautiful. She proves that a family can be found where you least expect it--maybe not under your own roof, but in that magical place where you find love. <i> The Secret Life of Bees</i> is a gift, filled with hope." (Luanne Rice, author of <i>Dream Country</i>) </p><p>"Writing with the intimate voice of the memoirist and with the Southerner's abiding sense of place, Sue Monk Kidd has written a forgiving story for the motherless child in all of us." (Shelby Hearon) </p><p>"Sue Monk Kidd has written a wonderful novel about mothers and daughters and the transcendent power of love, all the while masterfully illuminating the feminine face of God." (Connie May Fowler) </p><p>"With imagination as lush and colorful as the American South, a clutch of deliciously eccentric characters, and vivid prose, Sue Monk Kidd creates a rich, maternal haven in a harsh world." (Christina Schwarz) </p><p>"Sue Monk Kidd is an extraordinary storyteller. In "The Secret Life of Bees," she explores a young girl's search for the truth about her mother; her courage to tear down racial barriers; and her joy as she claims her place within a community of women. Beautifully written."

Written by the founder of RO DBT, Thomas Lynch, this comprehensive volume outlines the core theories of RO DBT, and provides a framework for implementing RO DBT in individual therapy.</p><p>While traditional dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) has shown tremendous success in treating people with emotion dysregulation, there have been few resources available for treating those with <i>overcontrol</i> disorders. OC has been linked to social isolation, aloof and distant relationships, cognitive rigidity, risk aversion, a strong need for structure, inhibited emotional expression, and hyper-perfectionism. And yet&#x2014;perhaps due to the high value our society places on the capacity to delay gratification and inhibit public displays of destructive emotions and impulses&#x2014;problems linked with OC have received little attention or been misunderstood. Indeed, people with OC are often considered highly successful by others, even as they suffer silently and alone.</p><p>RO DBT is based on the premise that psychological well-being involves the confluence of three factors: receptivity, flexibility, and social-connectedness. RO DBT addresses each of these important factors, and is the first treatment in the world to prioritize social-signaling as the primary mechanism of change based on a transdiagnostic, neuroregulatory model linking the communicative function of human emotions to the establishment of social connectedness and well-being. As such, RO DBT is an invaluable resource for treating an array of disorders that center around overcontrol and a lack of social connectedness&#x2014;such as anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, postpartum depression, treatment-resistant anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, as well as personality disorders such as avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, and paranoid personality disorder.</p><p>Written for mental health professionals, professors, or simply those interested in behavioral health, this seminal book&#x2014;along with its companion, <i>The Skills Training Manual for Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy</i> (available separately)&#x2014;provides everything you need to understand and implement this exciting new treatment in individual therapy&#x2014;including theory, history, research, ongoing studies, clinical examples, and future directions.</p></p><p><b>Thomas R.

Lynch&#x2019;s primary research interests include understanding and developing novel treatments for mood and personality disorders using a translational line of inquiry that combines basic neurobiobehavioral science with the most recent technological advances in intervention research. He is founder of radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT).<br><br> Lynch has received numerous awards and special recognitions from organizations such as the National Institutes of Health-US (NIMH, NIDA), Medical Research Council-UK (MRC-EME), and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD).

Rhoades Psychotherapy Research Endowment, and a Beck Institute Scholar.&#x201c;Radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT) is a truly innovative treatment, developed through translation of neuroscience into clinical practice, integrating various influences from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based approaches, emotion, personality and developmental theory, evolutionary theory, and Malamati Sufism. RO DBT is applicable to a spectrum of disorders characterized by excessive inhibitory control or <i>overcontrol</i> (OC). This is the first treatment that directly targets social signaling and nonverbal aspects of communication not only in clients but also in therapists. ... This book on the theory and practice of RO DBT, together with the skills training manual that describes the content of skills classes, are excellent guides for clinicians who want to embark in delivering transdiagnostic treatments based on science and clinical practice.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;</b><b>Mima Simic, MD, MRCPsych</b>, joint head of the child and adolescent eating disorder service, and consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London, UK (Mima Simic, MD, MRCPsych)<br><br>&#x201c;A new and comprehensive statement from one of the more creative minds in evidence-based clinical intervention today, RO DBT brings together a contemporary focus on a limited set of key transdiagnostic processes, with new assessment and intervention techniques for moving them in a positive direction. Emphasizing flexibility, openness, connection, and attention to social signaling, RO DBT specifies the details that can matter, from how you arrange your consulting room furniture to how nonverbal cues signal social information.

Hayes, PhD)<br><br>&#x201c;RO DBT offers an intriguing reconceptualization of traditional views of internalizing and externalizing disorders, and provides the clinician with valuable new tools to address a number of problems that have been particularly resistant to standard CBT approaches. I will definitely include RO DBT theory and techniques in my graduate-level intervention class. I know beginning clinicians in particular will be grateful to have a systematic way to approach these slow-to-warm-up clients who are difficult to establish rapport with. Their early termination from therapy and failure to respond to traditional approaches often leaves clinicians befuddled and critical of their own skills. RO DBT provides a compassionate way for clinicians to view this type of resistant client, as well as to work on some areas that are likely to benefit them.

Jessica Shortall shares the nitty-gritty basics of surviving the working world as a breastfeeding mom, offering a road map for negotiating the pumping schedule with colleagues, navigating business travel, and problem-solving when forced to pump in less-than-desirable locales. Drawing on the war stories, hacks, and humor of working moms, and on her own stories from her demanding job and travel in developing countries, she gives women moral support for dealing with the stress and guilt that come with juggling working and breastfeeding.

Then she vanished.In the fall of 1895, Etta Place falls in love with Harry Longabaugh, alias the Sundance Kid. She gives up everything to follow him and his partner-in-crime, Butch Cassidy, in their outlaw life across the continent and beyond. Breathtakingly beautiful and every inch a lady, Etta can also ride and shoot as well as any man. As their fugitive life begins to crumble, she finds herself alone and living in a convent with her newborn son.

He was in his seventies, hadn&#39;t been on a bike for years, and had never ridden more than a few miles at a time. But, in May 2002, putting doubters-and self-doubt-behind him, Petterson headed west. Laboring against strong headwinds, struggling up steep hills, or coping with extreme weather, he sometimes wondered what in the world he was doing. But he kept going-the lure of riding his bike across the Golden Gate a compelling incentive. Ahead of him lay many challenges-among them, riding his loaded bike over the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, crossing the Great Plains in brutal summer heat, dealing with the aftermath of a collision with a car, and traversing Nevada&#39;s basin and range country and the Great Salt Lake&#39;s desert. His rewards included passing through spectacular mountain forests, experiencing the aching beauty of the lonely plains, and viewing the grandeur of the West&#39;s sculpted canyons and mesas. In Old Man on a Bicycle, the author relates how he prepared for the 3,600-mile journey and what he saw and did during the two months he was on the road. In addition he rebuts the misconception that aging means debilitating decline and, drawing on certain events of his ride, offers research-based advice on how to ease the physical aspects of aging. It&#39;s an inspirational account, emphasizing the importance of exercise to physical and mental well-being.</p><p>A retired Foreign Service officer whose ten overseas assignments included ambassadorships to Somalia, Tanzania and Sudan, Don Petterson is the author of Inside Sudan and Revolution in Zanzibar.

Leaders everywhere recognized the validity of resonant leadership, but struggled with how to achieve and sustain resonance amid the relentless demands of work and life. Now, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee provide an indispensable guide to overcoming the vicious cycle of stress, sacrifice, and dissonance that afflicts many leaders. Drawing from extensive multidisciplinary research and real-life stories, Resonant Leadership offers a field-tested framework for creating the resonance that fuels great leadership. Rather than constantly sacrificing themselves to workplace demands, leaders can manage the cycle using specific techniques to combat stress, avoid burnout, and renew themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. The book reveals that the path to resonance is through mindfulness, hope, and compassion and shows how intentionally employing these qualities creates effective and enduring leadership. Great leaders are resonant leaders. Resonant Leadership offers the inspiration--and tools--to spark and sustain resonance in ourselves and in those we lead.</p><p>Unlike most other books, <i>Resonant Leadership</i> undersells itself. With easy justification, the authors or their editors at Harvard Business School Press could have applied a more expansive moniker like "Secrets of Enduring Leaders", or "How to Deal with Burnout," or perhaps even "Being Happy at Work." The work's modest title, though, takes nothing away from its grand ambition: to explain what makes leaders effective amid unrelentingly stressful situations.<p> The authors, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee, will be familiar to many businesspeople and management theorists. They collaborated with Daniel Goleman on the bestselling <i>Primal Leadership</i>, which extended Goleman's seminal work on emotional intelligence, and explained how "EQ", not just IQ, underpins success in guiding and directing organizations. With this latest book, Boyatzis and McKee have continued developing their holistic view of management. It's an attractive one. <i>Resonant Leadership</i> begins with recognition of leaders' essential humanity and analyzes the physical, mental, and emotional triggers that make men and women strong or weak as leaders. As readers might expect from an HBS Press offering, Boyatzis and McKee's methodology is appropriately academic, with extensive footnotes and research citations, but it also uses a nice blend of anecdotes from their field work as consultants, and is expressed through decidedly touchy-feely language. What emerges is a highly engaging, readable work that takes business audiences into somewhat unusual psychological territory, far beyond the usual bar charts and spreadsheets.</p><p> The book's organization is simple. Boyatzis and McKee start by describing the highly stressful conditions in which leaders operate today, and explain sympathetically how many well-intentioned people fall into what they call "dissonance" due to burnout. Whereas the authors' earlier book focused on the initial ingredients for leadership effectiveness, their interest now is in ongoing, enduring resonance--leaders who can be effective today, but also maintain their edge into tomorrow, as well. <i>Resonant Leadership</i> thus moves from this initial exposition of problems--management ineffectiveness, and/or burnout--to solutions. The authors anchor their prescription around three core qualities which they believe resonant leaders must continually cultivate: mindfulness, hope, and compassion. These may sound like ephemeral concepts, but they form the touchstone of <i>Resonant Leadership</i> and are cited again and again. Readers of Boyatzis and McKee's latest--whether already-strong leaders looking to maintain their effectiveness, or burned-out ones aiming to get back in the proverbial saddle--will find this is a thought-provoking read. <i>--Peter Han</i></p>Richard Boyatzis is Professor in the Department of Organizational Behavior at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve.

Knight Foundation.INTRODUCTION<br> Ben Jealous<br> &nbsp;<br> I was blessed to grow up in a home where stories of great black men and women were served up as frequently as spoon bread and fried apples. My grandmother told and retold stories of ancestors who had been born slaves and went on to found universities and banks and become statesmen during Reconstruction. My grandfather maintained an informal basement bar where I<br> spent valuable evenings and weekend afternoons listening to his friends, all of whom were born into segregation but rose up above the walls of limitation. My parents told me bedtime tales<br> about their experiences fighting Jim Crow with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the National Association for<br> the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Together, these stories inspired me to dream big dreams of helping to increase opportunity for all people. Perhaps even more importantly, they instilled in me the habit of seeking out the stories of others. Their stories and the dreams they inspired started me on my own path toward leadership.<br> Since the beginning of time, imitation has always been the first step for those who achieve great things. Children pick up sticks to reenact the battles of great soldiers. Toddlers preach to congregations of teddy bears and puppets. Babies step into their parents&#x2019; shoes and try to walk. However, here&#x2019;s the rub: each of us can only imitate what we know. We cannot imitate<br> that which we have never seen, heard, or read about.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the rapid advances of technology, young men of color today often lack access to positive images and stories about others who look like them. With the exception of stories about one black man who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the reporting we see about men of color on the nightly news often leaves little good to imitate.<br> Occasionally, the images of our greatest heroes do break through. Black-and-white film reels of Martin Luther King Jr. and Thurgood Marshall flicker in classrooms on rainy days across the country. However, the grainy images place these icons in another era, in a time when the battles seemed perhaps simpler, the outcomes predetermined. Their lives are remembered in a way that makes them so flawless, so impossibly<br> angelic, that their stories and achievements seem unattainable.<br> This is a book of everyday heroes. It is a collection of men known and unknown, most of whom have grown up since desegregation, all of whom have faced challenge, and all of whom have lived their lives in ways that are&nbsp; relevant to each of us. It is offered as a gift of gifts: each man featured in these pages sat down with us to tell his story so that it could be combined with the stories of others and handed down from parents, godparents, aunts and uncles, older brothers and peers to young men seeking to find their way.<br> My hope is that this book will empower you, as my family&#x2019;s stories empowered me, with examples of black men who have overcome great challenges to do even greater things. I encourage you to read these stories, to ask your elders for their own and, ultimately, empowered with that new knowledge, to live a life of meaning that will leave a legacy for generations to come.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> INTRODUCTION<br> Trabian Shorters<br> &nbsp;<br> You could hear a pin drop when I told my board of directors at the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation that I would step down in three months to build a new network called the<br> BMe Community. The sudden hush was followed by raucous applause.<br> Through the course of my work at the Knight Foundation, I enjoyed incredible access to elite people and their information, and I stumbled upon a number of discoveries that made it imperative to launch BMe.<br> We are in the middle of the biggest cultural transfer in the history of the nation. The baby boomers, who have defined the American story for decades, are aging out at the exact moment<br> that the millennial generation is coming of age. The millennials are inheriting the narrative left behind by these analog immigrants to their digital world, but they aren&#x2019;t necessarily embracing it.<br> On the contrary, America on the millennials&#x2019; watch will no longer have a racial majority. All of the social myths will be updated, for better or for worse. If we make a concerted effort<br> to understand each other over the next decade, I think we can change them for the better.<br> This optimism is based, in part, on the social science that has permeated popular culture over the past few years&#x2014;the research and writing of Daniel Kahneman, Chip and Dan Heath, and others. Our brains use all sorts of shortcuts to process information. People make decisions based not upon facts, but upon their <i>perceptions </i>of reality, and these perceptions are primed by the stories already running in our heads. As a result, we are prone to certain consistent, persistent mistakes in perception. One of these mistakes is that &#x201c;what you see is all there is.&#x201d; When black males are portrayed everywhere we look in a negative light, our brains&#x2014;no matter our race or sex&#x2014;are prone and primed to believe that this portrayal is correct, even the norm. In fact, it&#x2019;s not. Not by a long shot.<br> People, however, need more than just statistics to change their perspectives. Statistics are often rejected if they do not reinforce preexisting beliefs. On the other hand, <i>stories </i>involving<br> relatable characters are &#x201c;experienced&#x201d; by the mind. When we hear a story, we put ourselves in that person&#x2019;s shoes for a minute. The story gives us an opportunity to reconsider our perspective<br> and position. And we tend to choose the perspective that leaves us looking the best, even if that means discarding a mistaken position from before.<br> This is a book of stories about men whom you know but perhaps have not been erceiving fully. They are normal black men. They are good men. They are imperfect men, flawed, with&nbsp; struggles just like yours and decisions just as good or just as poor as some that you&#x2019;ve made. Every one of the men in this book is also a community builder, somebody who wants us all<br> to live in a more caring and prosperous world.<br> We encourage everyone, of all races and sexes, to explore life through the eyes of these men. Once you do, it will become very easy to see brothers like these in your day-to-day life.<br> The mission of the BMe Community is to build caring and prosperous communities inspired by black men. All proceeds from the sale of this book will go to support that positive aspiration. Anyone can join the BMe Community, regardless of race or sex, because our mission is actually about building communities, not about saving the black man. We believe in building upon positive people, positive aspirations, and positive opportunities to tell the truth to one another and work together for a better future.</p><h2>1001 Ways to Be Romantic: More Romantic Than Ever</h2><p><p><strong>#1 Bestseller, 1.6 million books sold!</strong></p><p><em>Sure, you could buy some roses.<br>Yes, you could cook an elegant romantic dinner.<br>Of course, you could give a heart-shaped box of chocolates.</em></p><p>But sometimes you want to do more than that.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christcentered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. <br><br>Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. <br><br><i>Exalting Jesus in Matthew</i> is the second volume in the series and is solely authored by Platt (best-selling author of <i>Radical</i>). Other projected contributors to the series include notable authors such as Russell D. Moore, Al Mohler, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Mark Dever, and others.<br></p><p><b>David Platt</b>&#x2019;s first love in ministry is making disciples&#x2014;sharing, showing, and teaching God&#x2019;s Word in everyday life. He has traveled extensively to serve alongside church leaders around the world. David is the president of the International Mission Board and the founder of Radical, a resource ministry that exists to serve the church in accomplishing the mission of Christ. He is also the author of several books, <i>Follow Me</i>, <i>Radical</i>, and <i>Radical Together</i> and most recently <i>Counter Culture (</i>to be released February 2015<i>)</i>.&nbsp; He is the founder of Radical (Radical.net) a resource ministry devoted to serving churches and disseminating disciple-making resources. David and his wife, Heather, have four children: Caleb, Joshua, Mara Ruth, and Isaiah.Confidence in the truth and power of God&#x2019;s written Word should prompt pastors and teachers not only to say worthy things about the Bible, but also to preach and teach with faithfulness&nbsp;<i>from</i>&nbsp;the Bible.&nbsp;The <i>Christ-Centered Exposition</i> series helps us to do just that.&nbsp;Theologically rock solid, this series is a clear, practical, and useful guide to the kind of biblical exposition that will please the Lord and build up his church.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Timothy George</b><br> Founding dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University and general editor of the&nbsp;<i>Reformation Commentary on Scripture</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There is nothing more helpful to a pastor than resources that are biblically faithful and pastorally applicable. &nbsp;The Christ-Centered Exposition series hits the bull&#x2019;s eye. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the Scripture in its context in order to apply it in real life.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Darrin Patrick</b><br> Lead pastor of The Journey, St. Louis, and co-author of <i>For the City</i><br> David Platt, Tony Akin, and Tony Merida have launched a series that will give a rising generation of pastors a tremendous resource for seeing how all the Scriptures prepare for and proclaim the ministry of Christ. The pastoral focus, the preaching tools and the redemptive insights make this a series of immediate use and great aid to pastors who want to equip their people to serve the Lord in the joyous power of the gospel &#x2013; rather than in the vain pressures of servile dread or slavish fear.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Bryan Chapell</b><br> President Emeritus, Covenant Seminary and Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church<br><br> It's one thing to know Bible stories; it's another to know the story of the Bible. It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series. It models for preachers and teachers how to proclaim&#x2014;with pastoral focus and exegetical care&#x2014;the beauty of the gospel from every page of Scripture.<br><br><b>Matt Smethurst</b><br> Associate Editor for The Gospel Coalition<br><br> Few things are more important for faithful biblical interpretation than reading Scripture in light of its master narrative. The Christ-Centered Exposition series aims to do just that.&nbsp; In a postmodern age, these commentaries provide pastors and lay people an invaluable resource that is unswervingly committed to the authority of Scripture and the centrality of the Gospel in the Bible&#x2019;s storyline.<br><br><b>Dr. R.

The artificial intelligence system, created by DeepMind, had been fed nothing but the rules of the Royal Game when it beat the world's strongest chess engine in a prolonged match. The selection of ten games published in December 2017 created a worldwide sensation: how was it possible to play in such a brilliant and risky style and not lose a single game against an opponent of superhuman strength? For Game Changer, Matthew Sadler and Natasha Regan investigated more than two thousand previously unpublished games by AlphaZero. They also had unparalleled access to its team of developers and were offered a unique look &#x2018;under the bonnet' to grasp the depth and breadth of AlphaZero's search. Sadler and Regan reveal its thinking process and tell the story of the human motivation and the techniques that created AlphaZero. Game Changer also presents a collection of lucidly explained chess games of astonishing quality. Both professionals and club players will improve their game by studying AlphaZero's stunning discoveries in every field that matters: opening preparation, piece mobility, initiative, attacking techniques, long-term sacrifices and much more. The story of AlphaZero has a wider impact. Game Changer offers intriguing insights into the opportunities and horizons of Artificial Intelligence. Not just in solving games, but in providing solutions for a wide variety of challenges in society. With a foreword by former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov and an introduction by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.</p><p>Matthew Sadler (1974) is a Grandmaster who twice won the British Championship and was awarded an individual Gold Medal at the 1996 Olympiad. He has authored several highly acclaimed books on chess and has been writing the famous &#x2018;Sadler on Books' column for New In Chess magazine for many years. Natasha Regan is a Women's International Master from England who achieved a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. Matthew Sadler and Natasha Regan won the English Chess Federation 2016 Book of the Award for their book Chess for Life. Garry Kasparov (1963) is a former World Chess Champion. After his retirement from chess in 2005 he devoted his time to politics and writing. His latest book is Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins. Demis Hassabis (1976) is co-founder and CEO of DeepMind, the world's leading AI research organisation which developed &#x2018;AlphaGo', the first program to master Go. A child chess prodigy, he is also a renowned computer scientist, neuroscientist and videogame designer."Chess has been shaken to its roots by AlphaZero" (Garry Kasparov, Former World Chess Champion)<br><br>""Most unnerving was that AlphaZero seemed to express insight. It played like no computer ever has, intuitively and beautifully, with a romantic, attacking style." (Steven Strogatz, Professor of mathematics at Corner <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Quite inspirational. I was thinking at several points during the game [in Round 11 of the 2019 Tata Steel Chess Tournament]: how would AlphaZero have approached this?" (Magnus Carlsen, World Chess Champion)<br><br>"I love Game Changer. This is a phenomenal book."

Maybe you have a large collection, too. Perhaps you have a few books that are your favorites and you reread them every year or two. But if you have favorites, why read others? The answer, of course, is so that you can understand and experience new things. Maybe you'll find a new favorite, too. <br>For many decades I have worked with astrology. It's my favorite. But I have also worked with the Tarot, runes, and other divinatory systems. In recent years, palmistry seems to have been overlooked by most readers. Perhaps they think that clients won't see the magick unless there are mystic tools on the table. <br>I think this is shortsighted. Palmistry can be a wonderful addition to your divinatory skills and can be used at a moment's notice. And one of the best introductions to this ancient art is Richard Webster's <i>Palm Reading for Beginners. <br></i>One of the most famous palmists of all time was Count Louis Hamon who used the name "Cheiro." He lived into the 20th century and looked a bit like Franklin D. Roosevelt. Because of his amazing skills he was in demand by famous personalities all over the world and he hobnobbed with them all. <br>Now, I can't guarantee you'll become as famous as Cheiro, but I can assure you that with this book you will learn how to read palms. You'll learn the meaning of the shape of the hand and all the lines. You'll be able to interpret the all of the major and minor lines, the phalanges (sections of fingers) and the nine mounts on the palm. The book also shows how you can blend all of the information into a coherent, inviting, and exciting reading. <br>So whether you want to learn your first method of divination or want to add to what you already know, this is a book you should study and use. <br> <br><p><strong>Richard Webster</strong> (New Zealand) is the bestselling author of more than one hundred books<em>. </em>Richard has appeared on several radio and television programs in the US and abroad, including guest spots on&nbsp;WMAQ-TV (Chicago), KTLA-TV (Los Angeles), and KSTW-TV (Seattle).

What can we do for our twenty- and even thirty-somethings who can&#x2019;t seem to grow up? How can we help our depressed, dependent, or addicted adult children, the ones who can&#x2019;t get their lives started, who are just marking time or even doing it? What&#x2019;s the right strategy when our smart, capable &#x201c;adultolescents&#x201d; won&#x2019;t leave home or come boomeranging back? Who can we turn to when the kids aren&#x2019;t all right and we, their parents, are frightened, frustrated, resentful, embarrassed, and especially, disappointed?<br><br>In this groundbreaking book, a social psychologist who&#x2019;s been chronicling the lives of American families for over two decades confronts our deepest concerns, including our silence and self-imposed sense of isolation, when our grown kids have failed to thrive. She listens to a generation that &#x201c;did everything right&#x201d; and expected its children to grow into happy, healthy, successful adults. But they haven&#x2019;t, at least, not yet&#x2014;and meanwhile, we&#x2019;re letting their problems threaten our health, marriages, security, freedom, careers or retirement, and other family relationships.<br> <br> With warmth, empathy, and perspective, Dr. Adams offers a positive, life-affirming message to parents who are still trying to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; their adult children&#x2014;Stop! She shows us how to separate from their problems without separating from them, and how to be a positive force in their lives while getting on with our own. As we navigate this critical passage in our second adulthood and their first, the bestselling author of <i>I&#x2019;m Still Your Mother</i> reminds us that the pleasures and possibilities of postparenthood should not depend on how our kids turn out, but on how we do!</p><p>So your adored son is nearing 30--or past it already--and still living at home, unable to hold onto a McJob for longer than six months running, relying on you to feed him and make his car payments. Your beautiful, brainy daughter is anorexic, or addicted to drugs, or unwilling to leave the man who hits her. Increasing numbers of baby boomers are finding that their grown children have fallen far short of their expectations. These parents are confused, angry, guilt-ridden, and ashamed. Jane Adams&#x2019;s <i>When Our Grown Kids Disappoint Us</i> is for them. She reveals the kinds of disappointments that other parents are facing: kids who are unable or unwilling to support themselves, kids who are addicts or convicts, kids who&#x2019;ve joined cults or seemingly dropped off the face of the earth. She stresses that these are real problems--but that they aren&#x2019;t the parents&#x2019; problems. Adams reassures parents that they&#x2019;ve done their jobs and that they don&#x2019;t have to spend the rest of their lives picking up the pieces for their grown children, emotionally, financially, or otherwise. Continuing to prop up kids who&#x2019;ve repeatedly fallen on their own teaches them nothing; it&#x2019;s just a temporary fix. Beyond offering sympathy, reassurance, and wisdom, the book doesn&#x2019;t lay out a plan for solving anyone&#x2019;s problems, but reading it may help disappointed parents shuck some of their guilt and shame, gather the courage to take back their own lives, and let their grown children fend for themselves. <i>--Jennifer Lindsay</i>Jane Adams has spent over two decades researching and reporting on how Americans live, work, and love, and especially how they respond to social change.

And basic to that study is a simple outline of states, countries and continents. In Draw Africa I have tried to give students an easy introduction to committing the map of Africa to memory. Through simple, step-by-step instructions, kids learn to draw each country as it connects to its neighbors and, with a little practice, will be able to draw Africa as a whole.</p><p>Education seeks to broaden a children's minds, to entice them to explore. Through books, and videos kids can virtually travel to faraway places; studying geography will augment those travels and their journey will be that much richer because they know where they are going.</p><p>By giving children a primer in the borders and locations of states, provinces and countries I hope to invite them further into the beautifully complicated world of geography.</p></p><p></p><h2>Pollyanna (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)</h2><p><p>Chatty, idealistic Pollyanna can always find something to be glad about.

"Look at me," says the more experienced click beetle, giving a loud CLICK and flipping onto its feet. But try as he might, the clumsy little click beetle just can't get the hang of it--or can he? In the tradition of <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, Carle creates a winning story of perseverance and pride in achievement complete with an ingenious fiber-optic microchip that truly gives voice to the valiant little beetle as it CLICKs its way through the colorful pages and somersaults into your heart.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Very Clumsy Click Beetle</i>:</b><br><br>"Sure to be loved and requested again and again, Click Beetle is a well-crafted story, joyfully illustrated, that speaks to the hearts of young children."<b>--</b><i>Library Journal&nbsp;</i><br><br>"At once stark and sophisticated, Carle's trademark collage art fills the pages of his latest Very volume."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Carle's trademark artwork, featuring large, colorful collages set against expansive white space, is--as always--a strong attribute."--<i>Booklist</i></p><p>Eric Carle first published <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> in 1969, fully intending to create a series of interactive creature books for children. The beloved busy spider, quiet cricket, and lonely firefly books followed, but the artist's quest was not truly complete until <i>The Very Clumsy Click Beetle</i> was born. Carle, who says he'd rather watch a bug attempt to climb over a pebble than join an expedition to Mount Everest, appreciates the small things in life: the Eyed Elator (<i>Alaus oculatus</i>), to be exact--unremarkable except for that when this beetle falls on its back, it can't roll over to get up. Instead, it will stretch and release a snap mechanism that clicks and flips the beetle through the air, and ideally, back onto its feet. <p> The very clumsy click beetle has no trouble with the clicking and flipping part, but it does have trouble landing on its feet. The young beetle tries and tries again, encouraged by an ambling turtle, a slithering snail, and a scurrying mouse. Finally, when a curious boy approaches, the beetle takes coaching from a wise old click beetle ("QUICK, CLICK and FLIP!") and succeeds. Children will love the bright, bold, tissue-paper illustrations that tell this story of perseverance, as well as--of course--the unusual clicking sound (emanating from an electronic chip with built-in battery and light sensor) that accompanies this playful book.

The eldership must be actively functioning, competent and spiritually alive. The lack of elder and deacon training is an extremely critical problem. We are not training those who lead and have oversight of our churches. We erroneously believe that our serving elders and deacons understand spiritual oversight and care, but in fact our churches are filled with elders and deacons who confess that they are unprepared and untrained for their work. The <i>Biblical Eldership Study Guide</i> provides twelve comprehensive lessons regarding biblical eldership principles. It is designed for use (along with the text, <i>Biblical Eldership</i>) by the prospective new elder under the direction of a mentoring elder, or could also be used in group study.</p><p>Alexander Strauch was raised in New Jersey and converted to Christ at a Bible camp in New York State.

Sustaining belief without any doubts for one&#x2019;s entire life is a very rare accomplishment. Indeed, many would say that examining one&#x2019;s faith at least once is a central part of the Christian condition. In this landmark work, esteemed theologian Paul F. Knitter explains the unique path that he took to overcome his doubts, becoming a stronger Christian in the process.<br><br>Honest and unflinching, Without Buddha I Could not be a Christian narrates each spiritual dilemma that Knitter has struggled with and explains how a Buddhist worldview has allowed him to resolve each one. From the petitioning&#x2019; nature of Christian prayer to how Christianity views life after death, Knitter argues that a Buddhist standpoint can help inspire a more person-centred conception of Christianity, where individual religious experience comes first, and liturgy and tradition second. Moving and revolutionary, this edition comes with a new postscript in which Professor Knitter reflects on and re-evaluates his position as a double-belonger.<br></p><p>&#34;The dialogue between Christianity and Buddhism is one of the most important conversations of our time, and Paul Knitter&#39;s new book shows why. It offers much more than words: religion at its best transforms us, and herein we see its fruits.

Dunny drove slowly on the pebbled gray asphalt back roads to Bois Sauvage, encountering a house, a trailer, another car once every mile in the wilderness of woods, red dirt ditches, and stretches of swampy undergrowth. Joshua watched Dunny blow smoke from his mouth and attempt to pass the blunt he&#x2019;d rolled on the river beach to Christophe. Christophe shook his head no. Shrugging and sucking on the blunt, Dunny turned the music up so Pastor Troy&#x2019;s voice rasped from the speakers, calling God and the Devil, conjuring angels and demons, and blasting them out. Christophe had taken off his shirt and lumped it into a wet ball in his lap. His bare feet, like Joshua&#x2019;s, were caked with sand.<br> <br>Joshua stretched across the backseat, shirtless also, and tossed the twig on the carpet. He lay with his cheek on the upholstery of the door, his head halfway out the window. Joshua loved the country; he loved the undulating land they moved through, the trees that overhung the back roads to create green tunnels that fractured sunlight. He and Christophe had played basketball through junior high and high school, and after traveling on basketball trips to Jackson, to Hattiesburg, to Greenwood, and to New Orleans for tournaments, he knew that most of the south looked like this: pines and dirt interrupted by small towns. He knew that there shouldn&#x2019;t be anything special about Bois Sauvage, but there was: he knew every copse of trees, every stray dog, every bend of every half-paved road, every uneven plane of each warped, dilapidated house, every hidden swimming hole. While the other towns of the coast shared boundaries and melted into each other so that he could only tell he was leaving one and arriving in the other by some landmark, like a Circle K or a Catholic church, Bois Sauvage dug in small on the back of the bay, isolated. Natural boundaries surrounded it on three sides. To the south, east, and west, a bayou bordered it, the same bayou that the Wolf River emptied into before it pooled into the Bay of Angels and then out to the Gulf of Mexico. There were only two roads that crossed the bayou and led out of Bois Sauvage to St. Catherine, the next town over. To the north, the interstate capped the small town like a ruler, beyond which a thick bristle of pine forest stretched off and away into the horizon. It was beautiful.<br> <br>Joshua could understand why Ma-mee&#x2019;s and Papa&#x2019;s families had migrated here from New Orleans, had struggled to domesticate the low-lying, sandy earth that reeked of rotten eggs in a dry summer and washed away easily in a wet one. Land had been cheaper along the Mississippi gulf, and black Creoles had spread along the coastline. They&#x2019;d bargained in broken English and French to buy tens of acres of land. Still, they and their poor white neighbors were dependent on the rich for their livelihood, just as they had been in New Orleans: they built weekend mansions along the beach for wealthy New Orleans expatriates, cleaned them, did their yard work, and fished, shrimped, and harvested oysters. Yet here, they had space and earth.<br> <br>They developed their own small, self-contained communities: they intermarried with others like themselves, raised small, uneven houses from the red mud. They planted and harvested small crops. They kept horses and chickens and pigs. They built tiny stills in the wood behind their houses that were renowned for the clarity of the liquor, the strong oily consistency of it, the way it bore a hole down the throat raw. They parceled out their acres to their children, to their passels of seven and twelve. They taught their children to shoot and to drive young, and sent them to one-room schoolhouses that only advanced to the seventh grade. Their children built small, uneven houses, married at seventeen and fourteen, and started families. They called Bois Sauvage God&#x2019;s country.<br> <br>Their children&#x2019;s children grew, the government desegregated the schools, and they sent them to the public schools in St. Catherine to sit for the first time next to white people. Their children&#x2019;s children could walk along the beaches, could walk through the park in St. Catherine without the caretakers chasing them away, hollering nigger. Their children&#x2019;s children graduated from high school and got jobs at the docks, at convenience stores, at restaurants, as maids and carpenters and landscapers like their mothers and fathers, and they stayed. Like the oyster shell foundation upon which the county workers packed sand to pave the roads, the communities of Bois Sauvage, both black and white, embedded themselves in the red clay and remained. Every time Joshua returned from a school trip and the bus crossed the bayou or took the exit for Bois Sauvage from the highway, he felt that he could breathe again. Even seeing the small, green metal exit sign made something ease in his chest. Joshua rubbed his feet together and the sand slid away from his skin in small, wet clumps that reminded him of lukewarm grits.<br> <br>When Joshua and Christophe talked about what they wanted to do with their lives, it never included leaving Bois Sauvage, even though they could have joined their mother, Cille, who lived in Atlanta. She sent Ma-mee money by Western Union once a month to help with groceries and clothing. Cille had still been living with Ma-mee when she had the twins, and when she decided to go to Atlanta to make something of herself when the boys were five, she left them. She told Ma-mee she was tired of accompanying her on jobs, of cleaning messes she didn&#x2019;t make, of dusting the undersides of tabletops, of mopping wooden living room floors that stretched the entire length of Ma-mee&#x2019;s house, of feeling invisible when she was in the same room with women who always smelled of refined roses. She told Ma-mee she&#x2019;d send for the twins once she found an apartment and a job, but she didn&#x2019;t. Ma-mee said that one day after Cille had been gone for eleven months, she stood in the doorway of their room and watched them sleep in their twin beds. She gazed at their curly, rough red-brown hair, their small bunched limbs, their skin the color of amber, and she decided to never ask Cille if she was ready to take them again. That was the summer their hair had turned deep red, the same color as Cille&#x2019;s, before it turned to brown, like a flame fading to ash, Ma-mee said.<br> <br>Three weeks after that morning, Cille visited. She didn&#x2019;t broach the subject of them coming back to Atlanta with her. She and Ma-mee had sat on the porch, and Ma-mee told her to send $200 a month: the boys would remain in Bois Sauvage, with her. Cille had assented as the sound of the twins chasing Ma-mee&#x2019;s chickens, whooping and squealing, drifted onto the screened porch from the yard. Ma-mee said it was common to apportion the raising of children to different family members in Bois Sauvage. It was the rule when she was a little girl; in the 1940s, medicine and food had been scarce, and it was normal for those with eleven or twelve children to give one or two away to childless couples, and even more normal for children to be shuffled around within the family, she said. Joshua knew plenty of people at school who had been raised by grandparents or an aunt or a cousin. Even so, he wished he hadn&#x2019;t been torturing the chickens; he wished that he&#x2019;d been able to see them talking, to see Cille&#x2019;s face, to see if it hurt her to leave them.<br> <br>Now Cille was working as a manager at a beauty supply store. She had green eyes she&#x2019;d inherited from Papa and long, kinky hair, and Joshua didn&#x2019;t know how he felt about her. He thought he had the kind of feelings for her that he had for her sisters, his aunts, but sometimes he thought he loved her most, and other times not at all. When she visited them twice a year, she went out to nightclubs and restaurants, and shopped with her friends. Joshua and Christophe talked about it, and Joshua thought they shared a distanced affection for her, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure. Christophe never stayed on the phone with Cille longer than five minutes, while Joshua would drag the conversation out, ask her questions until she would beg off the phone.<br> <br>But once when she&#x2019;d come home during the summer of their sophomore year, a kid named Rook from St. Catherine&#x2019;s had said something dirty about her at the basketball court down at the park while they were playing a game, something about how fine her ass was. Christophe had told Joshua later the particulars of what Rook had said, how the words had come out of Rook&#x2019;s mouth all breathy and hot because he was panting, and to Christophe, it had sounded so dirty. Joshua hadn&#x2019;t heard it because he was under the net, digging his elbow into Dunny&#x2019;s ribs, because he was the bigger man of the two. Christophe was at the edge of the court with the ball, trying to shake Rook, because he was smaller and faster, when Rook said it. Christophe had turned red in the face, pushed Rook away, brought the ball up, and with the sudden violence of a piston had fired the ball straight at Rook&#x2019;s face. It hit him squarely in the nose. There was blood everywhere and Christophe was yelling and calling Rook a bitch and Rook had his hand under his eyes and there was blood seeping through the cracks of his fingers, and Dunny was running to stand between them and laughing, telling Rook if he wouldn&#x2019;t have said shit about his aunt Cille, then maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten fucked up. Joshua was surprised because he felt his face burn and his hands twitch into fists and he realized he wanted to whip the shit out of dark little Rook, Rook with the nose that all the girls liked because it was fine and sharp as a crow&#x2019;s beak but that now was swollen fat and gorged with blood. Even now Joshua swallowed at the thought, and realized he was digging his fingers into his sides. Rook, little bitch.<br> <br>Joshua felt the wind flatten his eyelids and wondered if Cille would be at the school. He knew she knew they were graduating: he&#x2019;d addressed the graduation invitations himself, and hers was the first he&#x2019;d done. He thought of her last visit. She&#x2019;d come down for a week at Christmas, had given him and Christophe money and two gold rope chains. He and Christophe had drunk moonshine and ate fried turkey with the uncles on Christmas night in Uncle Paul&#x2019;s yard, and he&#x2019;d listened as his uncles talked about Cille as she left the house after midnight. She&#x2019;d sparkled in the dark when the light caught her jewelry and lit it like a cool, clean metal chain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where you going, girl?&#x201d; Uncle Paul had yelled at her outline.<br> <br>&#x201c;None of your damn business!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d yelled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Cille,&#x201d; Paul had said. &#x201c;Never could stay still.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2019;cause she spoiled,&#x201d; Uncle Julian, short and dark with baby-fine black hair, had said over the mouth of his bottle. &#x201c;She the baby girl: Papa&#x2019;s favorite. Plus, she look just like Mama.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop hogging the bottle, Jule,&#x201d; Uncle Paul had said.<br> <br>Joshua and Christophe had come in later that night to find Cille back in the house. She was asleep at the kitchen table with her head on her arms, breathing softly into the tablecloth. When they carried her to bed, she smelled sweetly, of alcohol and perfume. The last Joshua remembered seeing of her was on New Year&#x2019;s morning; she&#x2019;d been bleary and puffy eyed from driving an hour and a half to New Orleans the night before and partying on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. He and Christophe had walked into the kitchen in the same clothes from the previous day, fresh from the party up on the Hill at Remy&#x2019;s house that had ended when the sun rose, to see Cille eating greens and corn bread and black-eyed peas with Ma-mee. Ma-mee had wished them a Happy New Year and told them they stank and needed to take a bath. They had stopped to kiss and hug her, and after he embraced Ma-mee, Joshua had moved to hug Cille. She stopped him with a raised arm, and spoke words he could still hear.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a way to start off the New Year.&#x201d;<br> <br>He had known she was talking about his smell, his hangover, his dirt. He had given her a small, thin smile and backed away. Christophe left the room without trying to hug her, and Joshua followed. After they both took showers, Cille came to their room and embraced them both. Joshua had followed her back to the kitchen, wistfully, and saw her hand a small bank envelope filled with money to Ma-mee. She left. Joshua thought that on average now, she talked to them less and gave them more.<br> <br>He couldn&#x2019;t help it, but a small part of him wished she would be there when they got home, that she had come in late last night while he and Christophe were out celebrating with Dunny at a pre-graduation party in the middle of a field up further in the country in a smattering of cars and music under the full stars. Wrapped in the somnolent thump of the bass, Joshua closed his eyes, the sun through the leaves of the trees hot on his face, and fell asleep. When he woke up, they were pulling into the yard, Dunny was turning down the music, and there was no rental car in the dirt driveway of the small gray house surrounded by azalea bushes and old reaching oaks. Something dropped in his chest, and he decided not to think about it.<br> <br>Ma-mee heard the car pull into the yard: a loud, rough motor and the whine of an old steel body. Rap music: muffled men yelling and thumping bass. That was Dunny&#x2019;s car. The twins were home, and judging by the warmth of the air on her skin that made her housedress stick, the rising drone of the crickets, and the absence of what little traffic there was along the road in front of her house, they were late. She&#x2019;d pressed their gowns and hung them with wire hangers over the front door. She thought to fuss, but didn&#x2019;t. They were boys, and they were grown; they took her to her doctor&#x2019;s appointments, cooked for her, spoke to her with respect. They kept her company sometimes in the evenings, and over the wooing of the cicadas coming through the open windows in the summer or the buzzing of the electric space heater in the winter in the living room, described the action on TV shows for her: Oprah and reruns of The Cosby Show and nature shows about crocodiles and snakes, which she loved. They called her ma&#x2019;am, like they were children still, and never talked back. They were good boys.<br> <br>The front screen door squealed open and she heard them walk across the porch. She heard Dunny step heavily behind them and the sound of wet jeans pant legs rubbing together. The twins&#x2019; light tread advanced from the front porch and through the door. The smell of outside: sun-baked skin and sweat and freshwater and the juice of green growing things bloomed in her nose. From her recliner seat, she saw their shadows dimly against the walls she&#x2019;d had them paint blue, after she found out she was blind: the old whitewash that had coated the walls and the low, white ceiling had made her feel like she was lost in an indefinite space. She liked the idea of the blue mirroring the air outside, and the white ceiling like the clouds. When she walked down the narrow, dim hallway, she&#x2019;d run her fingers over the pine paneling there and imagined she was in her own private grove of young pines, as most of Bois Sauvage had been when she was younger. She&#x2019;d breathe in the hot piney smell and imagine herself slim-hipped and fierce, before she&#x2019;d married and born her children, before she started cleaning for rich white folks, when she filled as many sacks as her brothers did with sweet potatoes, melons, and corn. She spoke over the...</p><h2>Tratado de la Verdadera Devoci�n a la Sant�sima Virgen Mar�a (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Fr. de Montfort&#39;s masterpiece has lost nothing of its power and beauty with the passing of time and holds within its pages a rich spiritual treasure for the contemporary believer who is willing to enter into the Mystery of Jesus living in Mary and there to be formed by the Spirit of God into full maturity in Jesus Christ.</p><p></p><h2>Catechism of the Catholic Church With Theological Commentary</h2><p><p>"The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends.

Consider the numbers we choose when buying a lotto ticket--birth dates, anniversaries, ages, and addresses as well as other hopefully lucky numbers. They each have some personal meaning. Through the centuries, numerologists have been studying the significance of &nbsp;numbers and perfecting their art in the belief that numbers strongly influence both our behavior and our fate. They have learned that by understanding the meaning of numbers, we can gain greater insight into ourselves. <br><br> In <i>Numerology: Key to Your Inner Self, </i>world-renowned numerologist Hans Decoz and accomplished writer Tom Monte have teamed together to produce an easy-to-understand guide that introduces the reader to the basic concepts and applications of numerology. Presented here is a technique that relates the major questions of an individual&#x2019;s life &#x2013;his talents, challenges, career, and personal growth--with the basic numeric facts of his existence--his birth date and name. <br><br> The book begins with a fascinating explanation of what numerology is and an intriguing look at the philosophy that lies behind it. It then examines how numerology works, focusing on the numeric meanings of personal names, birth dates, and language in general. Included is a step-by-step guide to calculating your own numbers and interpreting them in chart form.</p><p><b>Hans Decoz</b> has traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. After settling in the United States in 1978, he established himself as one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts in numerology&#x2014;setting new standards for the quality and depth of numeric analysis.

Here I am on a seventeen-mile mountain bike ride at an altitude of 6,700 feet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The air I'm breathing in this pristine environment is clear and cool. It's a fresh, warm, early summer afternoon, and along with some new friends I am relishing a bit of free time at one of the most enlightening medical conferences I've ever attended. The event is devoted to using food to prevent and heal illness, and I feel so inspired that I can't wait to get back to Tucson to begin writing. I want very much to share all this new and exciting information with you, such as<br> </p><p> </p><li>how cancer can be prevented and reversed using food. </li><li>how heart disease can be treated using specific foods and nutrients. </li><li>how Alzheimer's disease can be prevented and treated with food and nutrients. </li><li>how food can cure chronic fatigue. </li><li>how diet and vitamins can restore emotional energy. <p><br> It turns out that every major ailment has a specific natural food prescription that can reverse its course. This is the cutting edge of medicine. </p><p> The Buddha wrote:<br> </p><p> Don't chase after the past,<br> Don't seek the future.<br> The past is gone.<br> The future hasn't come yet.<br> See clearly on the spot<br> That object which is now.<br> </p><p> In my work as a physician specializing in integrative medicine, I have used nutrition as part of my practice for many years. This type of medicine, as you may know, is the emerging field that blends the best of conventional Western science with ancient healing therapies such as yoga, meditation, nutrition, herbal medicines, and acupuncture. Because I use both Eastern and Western medicine, many of my patients have made unexpected recoveries from illnesses they had been struggling with for many years. Some of them have considered their recoveries to be miraculous, but I see only the natural outcome of good science and good sense. The one thing I have come to believe while participating in these recoveries with my patients -- whom I call my healing partners -- is that your body has the ability to heal itself if you just give it a chance. Using food as medicine gives my patients the greatest chance of all to heal. </p><p> One of the chief reasons my program has been so successful is that it treats each person as a unique being. If you come to see me, I take into consideration your biochemical uniqueness and then design a program to restore you to maximum physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. When that happens -- when you once again attain a healing balance in your body, mind, and spirit -- it certainly feels miraculous. It is the answer to your deepest prayer. </p><p> The practical use of modern nutritional principles, which I will present in this book, will allow you to activate your own natural inner healing force and bring you back into a balanced state. Since no two patients are alike, no two require exactly the same therapy. When a patient comes to me for pain, fatigue, memory loss, cancer recovery, high blood pressure, or some other ailment, I always have my nutritionist, Luz-Elena Shearer, R.D., M.S., meet with us. Working together, my patient, the patient's family, Luz, and I construct a perfect dietary prescription based on patient needs and preferences. Only rarely do two patients receive the same diet. I will present the information in this book so that you will be able to create a unique healing experience for yourself. </p><p> What I learned at the conference in Wyoming brought my knowledge and ability to help heal to a higher level. I learned the latest information on preventing and healing illness at the cellular level by using food to maintain genetic integrity. If you have been following the news about the human genome project, you are probably aware of the great advances it promises. One day, drugs or therapies will fight illness by treating our genes. But I believe we can do that right now by using food as our form of genetic therapy. My program will act on your body, your brain, your mind, and your spirit. It will also touch you on your deepest inner level: your soul. After all, mind, body, and spirit are united; they are one. True healing requires we affect them all. This is the future of medicine -- and here we are together at this precious moment.<br> </p><p> <b>SPIRITUAL NUTRITION</b> </p><p> Perhaps you are one of the many people today who are aware of the deep spiritual awakening occurring on the planet. You can see it in the latest best-selling books and seminars. Some of the most popular speakers of our day, such as my colleagues Dr. Deepak Chopra and Debbie Ford, bring a spiritual slant to everything they say and do. Take a look at Oprah Winfrey's show, the most popular program on daytime television, which has showcased many influential new authors and spokespersons for the benefits of a spiritual lifestyle. Each Oprah program ends with a segment called "Touching Spirit," which is very popular and empowering to the members of her audience. It stirs them at a deep level. </p><p> This kind of elevation in consciousness recently touched one of my healing partners, a forty-year-old woman named Jane, who had spent a lot of time searching for help in dealing with her serious case of chronic fatigue syndrome. Jane had visited some of the most highly regarded physicians in America but had made little progress. One renowned doctor saw her for fifteen minutes, glanced at her chart in a cursory way, and told her that he wasn't optimistic about her recovery. Despite that unpleasant experience, she kept searching for a cure -- or at least someone who believed in her ability to heal. Finally, she was referred to me. Working together, Jane and I designed a program that returned her to wellness. </p><p> One day she wanted to discuss a realization she had had, based on her meditation practice and reinforced by her travels around the country. She felt that something important was happening in the minds of people, but she couldn't put her finger on it. She asked me if I knew what it was. I told her that I saw the situation as more than just a change from the old way of treating people medically to a new way. The real shift we are witnessing today, I said, and still believe, is in how we look at the world in relation to ourselves. </p><p> I have written about the reasons behind this shift before. As I discussed in my book Meditation as Medicine, we are now entering a new age: the Age of Aquarius. Age shifts are natural phenomena that occur every two thousand years. Jesus Christ ushered in the previous transition, from the Age of Sagittarius to the Age of Pisces. Astrological scholars believe that the world changed again at midnight on November 11, 1991. At that moment the Age of Pisces ended and the Age of Aquarius began. Astrological transitions are marked by three seven-year periods totaling a twenty-one-year cusp. This current transition will end in 2012. Each seven-year stage brings with it accelerated change. I think you will agree that we are certainly seeing such a positive change now as people become more aware of their spiritual nature. But we are also witnessing the polar opposite of that positive change. The negative corollary in this age of transition includes an increase in terrorism, fear, violence, and rage. On a medical level, we can see a rising incidence of illnesses such as chronic fatigue and obesity, as well as escalating rates of some cancers. </p><p> The single most significant change we are witnessing in this Age of Aquarius is how it revolves around experience rather than information. In its initial stages, the Age of Aquarius still centered on information and its effects on us. For example, our collective quest for information led to the development of the personal computer and the rise of the Internet. During the information age, the cry was "I want to know, I want to know." While it is still useful, the desire for pure information for its own sake has subsided as we realize that what we need most is useful personal experience. As we ride the crest of the second seven years of this cusp, a new impulse has emerged. Now the shout is "I want an experience." This is readily apparent in many aspects of modern life -- in reality TV, for example, and in the increase in adventure travel. </p><p> This change in paradigm is especially vivid in the practice of medicine. Because patients have become so utterly discouraged with medical practice as driven by big business and HMOs, they now visit the offices of alternative medical practitioners in droves. In the 1980s, very few Americans had consulted an alternative medical practitioner, be it a nutritionist, yoga therapist, meditation expert, chiropractic physician, massage therapist, acupuncturist, or herbalist. However, in a 1991 Harvard study, this number had increased to 34 percent, and in 1999 over 50 percent of Americans had visited an alternative medical practitioner. This number is further climbing with every passing day. Extrapolation of the 1991 Harvard study suggests that Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of alternative medicine in 1990 alone. The financial ramification of this shift to integrative medicine is staggering. Expenditures associated with unconventional medical therapy in 1990 were approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which was paid by patients out of their own pockets. These uninsured costs are now up to $27 billion, based on a survey reported recently by the New England Journal of Medicine. </p><p> The reason people are embracing integrative medicine is apparent. Patients crave the experience of wellness that this type of treatment gives. It is what I call the feeling of healing. You usually leave the office of an alternative medical doctor feeling a lot better than when you entered. You have hope and the experience of happiness. The practitioner usually spends quality time with you, asking questions and seeking feedback. It has been my experience that when conventional doctors see you they are rarely in the moment. Their minds seem to be elsewhere. Many people tell me that a trip to the doctor leaves them feeling like a number or a file, not a person. It's no wonder, then, that so many patients, even those with chronic illnesses, are bailing out of the system. For the most part, conventional medicine does little to provide them with a true healing experience. </p><p> However, because patients demand it, conventional medicine has been forced to integrate proven natural healing techniques into the standard care of surgery, radiation therapy, and drugs. Yet, there is still a long way to go. One reason the evolution toward alternative or holistic medicine becomes bogged down is that we are taught to rely on technology instead of on our lifestyles and ourselves to heal. We have been taught that optimal health, deep healing, satisfaction, gratification, happiness, and even God can be found out there somewhere. This concept of looking outside is simply not correct. All answers lie within. As long as words have been written, saints, sages, poets, writers, philosophers, and yogis have commented on this concept and shared this truth. About five hundred years ago, an Indian guru named Arjun clarified my favorite interpretation of this reality. He was known as the Fifth Master, the king of this world and the next. Here is what he wrote: </p><p> All things are within the heart,<br> The home of the self.<br> Outside there is nothing.<br> Those who look outside themselves<br> Are left wandering in doubt.<br> </p><p> Guru Arjun tells us that the truth we seek is within ourselves, and I agree. The answers to many of our greatest desires, needs, and longings are inside. We only need to learn how to retrieve them. </p><p> The most powerful vehicle for retrieving our longed-for answers is applied intelligence, which is the combination of information and experience. Applied intelligence brings true wisdom because it includes experience, usually on a deep level. Because times are changing, medicine must embrace change. It will do so for one simple reason: we, the people, want it to.<br> </p><p> <b>FORWARD TO THE FUTURE</b> </p><p> In his best-selling book Eating Well for Optimal Health, Andrew Weil, M.D., outlined his seven basic principles of diet and health. I'd like to repeat them here for you: </p><p> <br> </p></li><li>We have to eat to live.<br> </li><li>Eating is a major source of pleasure.<br> </li><li>Food that is healthy and food that gives pleasure are not mutually exclusive.<br> </li><li>Eating is an important focus of social interaction.<br> </li><li>How we eat reflects and defines our personal and cultural identity.<br> </li><li>How we eat is one determinant of health.<br> </li><li>Changing how we eat is one strategy for managing disease and restoring health.<br> <br> <p> From Eating Well for Optimal Health by Andrew Weil, M.D. Copyright 2000 by Andrew Weil, M.D. Used by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc. </p><p> I'm sure you will agree that all seven principles are reasonable and true. Nevertheless, I believe we can continue to go forward in our approach to food based on available new knowledge. We can begin with Dr. Weil's last principle and move beyond it with a new intensity. In the pages of this book, I will show you why it is so vitally important to leave your old nutritional habits of the past century behind and chart a new and different course. For example: </p><p> </p></li><li>I will tell you how food acts as a messenger to your genes and <br> </li><li>how you can use that knowledge to create vibrant health and healing.<br> </li><li>I will give you an introductory course on the latest scientific knowledge about why food is actually medicine for your body, mind, and spirit.<br> </li><li>I will share with you my new seven principles of eating a modern healing diet. You will learn about organic foods and determine how to identify them and where to find them. I will also tell you about the risks of genetically modified foods and how to avoid them.<br> </li><li>I will teach you how to gently and safely detoxify your body from the environmental pollutants you absorb every day.<br> </li><li>I will lead you to discover uncommon uses for common natural foods.<br> </li><li>I will teach you to craft special food combination diets for specific illnesses.<br> </li><li>I will teach you to use organic juices as natural medicines.<br> </li><li>I will show you how to institute specific vitamin and herbal therapies to accelerate healing.<br> </li><li>I will provide you with innovative recipes for meals that heal. Many of them come from my own family. My wife, Kirti, is Italian, and she is a wonderful cook. My son, Sat, is a professional natural food chef. My daughter, Hari, is a graduate of the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics. All of them have happily agreed to share some of their cooking ideas. Finally, with the blessings of my teacher, Yogi Bhajan, and his talented wife, Bibiji, I will instruct you on the preparation of spiritual nutrition recipes from the ancient healing tradition of yoga nutritional therapy.<br> <p> You will be asked to complete various assignments during the course of the book to determine your intake of food and help design the best diet for your ailment, issue, or conce...</p></li></p><h2>The Year of Cozy: 125 Recipes, Crafts, and Other Homemade Adventures</h2><p>From the author of the popular blog, <i>A Cozy Kitchen,</i> comes a beautifully photographed one-stop-shop book with all the recipes and projects you&#x2019;ll need for some cozy inspiration this holiday season&#x2014;and all year long.

There's little to no sweating, and mosquitoes aren't flying around. And the leaves, oh, the leaves! Autumn is, hands down, the best season to pack up some lunch and sit on a blanket in nature. I don't like to make it too much of a production. In order to cut the work down, I embrace the idea of half store- bought, half homemade. This means I buy cheeses, charcuterie, bread, and wine but make a fall salad and dessert at home.<br><br>My favorite fall salad is as simple as can be. I like to mix a bit of lemon juice and olive oil in a mixing bowl. Then I add a few pinches of salt and pepper. I like to add fresh herbs like Italian parsley and dill, and slices of fall fruit like Fuyu persimmons and/or apples. Pomegranate seeds add some nice color and texture.<br><br>My favorite on-the-go dessert is an apple galette. I like to slice up 2 Honeycrisp apples and toss them with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a squeeze of lemon juice. I roll out a single piecrust (see page 162), arrange the apples in the center, fold over the edges of the piecrust, brush the dough with an egg wash, and bake at 350�F for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.<br><br>GRAIN-FREE DOGGIE DOUGHNUTS<br><br>A dog turning a year older should always be an event. You don't have to make it a full-on party (doggie parties can get strange very quickly--trust me, I know), but I do think a small celebration of doughnuts and a candle is fun for the soul. Amelia hates talking about her age, so let's just say she turned 1. Again. MAKES 1 DOZEN<br><br>2 cups chickpea flour<br><br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br><br>1/2 cup natural creamy peanut butter (stir to incorporate any oil on top)<br><br>2 tablespoons honey<br><br>3 tablespoons melted coconut oil<br><br>2 large eggs<br><br>1/2 cup water<br><br>1 cup shredded apples (about 2 apples, peeled)<br><br>1 Preheat the oven to 325�F. Coat a doughnut pan liberally with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda. Add the peanut butter, honey, oil, eggs, and water. Mix until completely combined and then fold in the shredded apples.<br><br>2 Divide half the dough among the 6 cavities in the doughnut pan. Transfer to the oven to bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the doughnuts are lightly golden brown and spring back when touched.<br><br>3 To remove from the pan, run a butter knife along the inside and outside edges of the doughnuts. Place a wire rack on top of the doughnuts and flip it over, inverting the doughnuts. Repeat the process of spraying the pan, filling it up with the remaining batter, and baking it. Doughnuts will keep for 3 to 5 days when stored in an airtight container at room temperature.<br><br>HOMEMADE CANDLES<br><br>I have a bit of an obsession with candles. I'm not sure when it became en vogue to buy fancy candles, but I jumped on that bandwagon very quickly. I love them all: girly and floral, woodsy, musty, and spicy. And unfortunately for me, I love to burn these pricey candles all the time! So to curtail my expensive candle-buying habit, I figured it might be time I begin making them at home. At this time of year I love candles to smell like pine needles and cinnamon. It's in anticipation of what's to come. Feel free to customize them according to your liking--there's no wrong way to make candles. The ratios below will give you something that smells like the air a few days before Christmas. If you like, double the batch and have them ready for those last-minute gifts that often come in handy this time of year. MAKES 4<br><br>SUPPLIES<br><br>4 candlewicks<br><br>4 (1/2-cup) vessels of choice (glass jars or ceramic pots)<br><br>8 skewers<br><br>11/2 cups soy wax or beeswax pellets<br><br>Candle-making pot or double boiler<br><br>1 tablespoon cedarwood essential oil<br><br>4 drops lime essential oil<br><br>Tip: All of these candle-making supplies can be found at a craft store and online. The essential oils are easy to find at Whole Foods or other health food stores.<br><br>1 To start, set 1 wick in the center of each of the vessels.<br><br>2 Rest the skewers closely on both sides of the wicks. When we pour in the hot wax, the wicks will want to move around a bit and these skewers will help stabilize them.<br><br>3 Add the wax to your candle-making pot or double boiler top. (You can create a makeshift double boiler by placing a stainless steel bowl over a large pot filled with a few inches of water.) Turn the flame to medium.<br><br>4 Heat the wax until melted, about 6 to 8 minutes, being sure not to overheat, which will cause cracking in the final product (if this does happen, not to worry--the candle will still smell delicious and work just fine). When the wax is melted, pour in the cedarwood essential oil and lime essential oil. Mix. Give it a whiff and add a bit more if you like. Pour the hot wax into each of the vessels.<br><br>5 Allow the wax to cool completely, 2 to 4 hours, before using the candles.<br><br>BURNT BUTTER-PEAR-GINGER CRUMBLE<br><br>I love when I can feel fall creeping in. The nights become a bit chillier, the sun begins to set a little earlier, and the light takes on a golden quality. This feeling always makes me want to run to my oven to bake. This crumble will warm your house with all of the smells of the season.<br><br>The butter in this crumble is burnt, not browned. Burnt. I learned to burn my butter from my friend and baker, Hourie. She always takes the butter a bit too far, and it pays off in the flavor department. The spice from the fresh ginger and sweetness from the baked pears make you feel all cozy inside. And since I'm a crazy fan of icy and hot combinations, I say this must, must be eaten with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. MAKES 4 TO 6 SERVINGS<br><br>FILLING<br><br>3-4 baking pears, peeled, cored, and finely chopped (see note)<br><br>1/4 cup granulated sugar<br><br>1/4 cup brown sugar<br><br>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br><br>1/2" knob peeled fresh ginger, finely chopped<br><br>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br><br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br><br>CRUMBLE TOPPING<br><br>1 cup all-purpose flour<br><br>1/3 cup granulated sugar<br><br>1/4 cup oat flakes<br><br>1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts<br><br>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed<br><br>1 To make the filling: Preheat the oven to 350�F. No need to dirty a bowl: In an 8" x 8" baking dish, combine the pears, sugars, flour, ginger, vanilla, and salt. Toss until the pears are thoroughly coated. Set aside.<br><br>2 To make the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, oat flakes, and walnuts.<br><br>3 In a small saucepan set over medium-high heat, add the cubed butter. Brown the butter until it goes from yellow and bubbling to a very, very dark brown color. It might appear burnt (and it is), but not to worry, it'll taste delicious.<br><br>4 Pour the burnt butter into the medium bowl that's holding the flour and oat mixture. Using a spoon, stir the mixture until it's clumpy and everything is coated in butter.<br><br>5 Pour the crumble atop the filling and spread it out evenly. Transfer to the oven to bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crumble is bubbling and the top is golden brown.<br><br>Note: The best pears for baking are Boscs, Bartletts, green or red Anjous, or Forelles. All hold up nicely in the oven.<br><br>MARBLED BOWLS<br><br>It's no big secret that I love marble, actual natural marble. The lines and variances of shapes are so beautiful. Last Christmas, I took my obsession with marble into the kitchen when I made a cranberry-marbled cheesecake for my blog. And now, I'm taking it into my craft closet with these marbled bowls. If you're like me and have bottles of nail polish just sitting in your bathroom, then this DIY is perfect for you. This technique of marbling with nail polish can be applied to a variety of vessels like vases, mugs, and ramekins.<br><br>A few tips to keep in mind before you start:<br><br>Get everything prepped and then move quickly. The nail polish dries in the water very fast!<br><br>Use hot water. Cold water will make the nail polish seize.<br><br>Pour the nail polish close to the surface of the water. If you pour it from too high a distance, it will bead up and sink to the bottom.<br><br>Pour the 2 nail polishes at the same time.<br><br>If on the first try you don't succeed, don't worry. Remember that nail polish remover is your friend, if you need to start again.<br><br>SUPPLIES<br><br>Shallow container such as a pie pan (I used a shallow baking dish)<br><br>Gray nail polish<br><br>Mint green nail polish<br><br>Skewer<br><br>White bowls (see note)<br><br>Craft paper or old newspaper<br><br>Note: Do not use any vessel that is unglazed. I used very inexpensive white CorningWare bowls that I purchased from Target in the sale section. These bowls work very well because they are high gloss, which means that the nail polish rubs off very easily with a bit of nail polish remover. I also recommend using white bowls so the nail polish colors pop.<br><br>1 Fill the shallow container with hot water.<br><br>2 Open the 2 nail polishes and hold them close to the surface of the water. Pour them into the water at the same time.<br><br>3 Moving quickly, run the skewer through the center, creating a swirl effect.<br><br>4 Dip the sides of a bowl into the water. In order to get swirls all the way around, you'll need to repeat with fresh water and nail polish. If any nail polish has seeped into the center of the bowl, remove it using nail polish remover and a cotton ball. Repeat with the rest of the bowls. Place the bowls on a sheet of craft paper or old newspaper to dry for 5 hours.<br><br>5 Once the bowls are completely dry, remove any excess nail polish on the bottoms of the bowls or around the rim. Wash the insides of the bowls thoroughly with soap and water. These bowls are food safe (as long as there is no nail polish inside them) and should be strictly hand-washed.<br><br>Tip: The container that held the water and nail polish mixture will have some bits of nail polish on the sides and the bottom. I removed the nail polish with a cotton ball and nail polish remover and washed the container thoroughly with hot water and soap.<br><br>PEANUT BUTTER CUPS<br><br>Amelia is my spirit animal. We are sometimes cranky and bossy, usually lovable, optimistic at the core, and we both love, love peanut butter. There have been moments when she and I have lain in bed together eating apple slices dipped in peanut butter. They weren't our highest moments, but it happened and we've moved on. When it comes to Halloween, Amelia and I are lukewarm about the holiday. The spooky decor actually scares me, and Amelia always feels objectified when I dress her up in embarrassing costumes, though I still do it because, well, she's just too entertaining for me not to. The one redeeming thing about the holiday is homemade candy. And it should come as no surprise that my ultimate favorite is homemade peanut butter cups. MAKES 9<br><br>1/2 cup unsalted or salted creamy peanut butter<br><br>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar<br><br>Sea salt<br><br>1 cup cocoa powder<br><br>1/2 cup coconut oil, melted and warm<br><br>1/3 cup maple syrup<br><br>11/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br><br>Note: I recommend using natural peanut butter because the flavor is far superior and it contains no sugar. Just be sure to give it a good stir so the oil that resides on the top is reincorporated.<br><br>Tip: Since this recipe contains no stabilizers for the chocolate, if the peanut butter cups are kept at room temperature for too long, they'll melt, so just be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until serving.<br><br>1 Place liners into 9 muffin cups. In a small bowl, add the peanut butter and the confectioners' sugar. Using a hand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat until light, fluffy, and completely combined. If using unsalted peanut butter, add a few pinches of sea salt to taste (I like Maldon).<br><br>2 In a medium bowl, combine the cocoa powder, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Stir until very smooth.<br><br>3 Spoon 1 tablespoon of chocolate mixture into each liner. Smack the muffin tin on the counter to even out the chocolate. Transfer to the freezer for 5 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm.<br><br>4 Remove the muffin tin from the freezer and add 1 to 2 teaspoons of peanut butter mixture to each cup. Top with 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of chocolate and place in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until firm. Transfer to the refrigerator to thaw for about 30 minutes. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. When it's time to serve, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt atop each peanut butter cup.</p><h2>Once upon a Mastodon: All About Prehistoric Mammals (Cat in the Hat&#39;s Learning Library)</h2><p><b>How cool!

THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENING."<br>--Newsweek<br><br>"ENORMOUSLY ENTERTAINING."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"THIS BOOK SCARED THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME. . . . Manages to grab you with the authenticity of its scientific detective work and haunt you with its sheer plausibility."<br>--Entertainment Weekly<br><br>Five days ago, a homeless man on a subway platform died in agony as startled commuters looked on. Yesterday, a teenager started having violent, uncontrollable spasms in art class. Within minutes, she too was dead.<br><br>Dr. Alice Austen is a medical pathologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. What she knows is that the two deaths are connected. What she fears is that they are only the beginning. . . .</p><p>In New York City in the late '90s, a 17-year-old girl heads off to her private school even though she has a cold. By art class her nose is gushing mucus and she's severely disoriented. Within seconds, it seems, she's in convulsions and, most bizarrely, can't stop biting herself. All the reader can do is hope she'll die quickly, but Kate Moran's body still has a few more disgusting turns to undergo, and Richard Preston--a Jacobean master of ceremonies par excellence--takes us through them in bizarre and bloody detail. <p> Clearly, whatever Kate had was a head cold with a scientific vengeance. Preston's heroine, Alice Austen, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, realizes--in the first of several gripping autopsy scenes--that the girl's nervous system had been virtually destroyed. So far, only one other person is known to have died in the same way, but he was a homeless man. Austen must connect the two cases, seemingly linked only by the subway, before the media gets hold of them and drums up a paranoia-fest--and before the virus's creator can kill again. </p><p> <i>The Cobra Event</i> is itself a paranoia-fest, a provocative thriller that makes you wonder exactly how much bioterrorism is taking place in the real world. Preston, best known for his terrifying chronicle of the Ebola virus, <i>The Hot Zone</i>, and other impeccably researched nonfictions, is not content to create fast-paced nightmarish scenes. His novel is instead a complex morality tale anchored in uncomfortable fact. Preston is keen to convey the "invisible history" of bioweapons engineering and, equally, to show the unsung heroism of his scientific detectives (along with that of the nurses and technicians who literally sacrifice their lives for medicine). Like their creator, these characters are not without a sense of humor. One calls the manmade virus "the ultimate head cold." Readers will never forget literally dozens of scenes and will never again see the subway, rodents, autopsy knives, and--above all--runny noses in the same light.</p><b>Praise for Richard Preston and The Hot Zone</b><br> <br>"A tour de force...Preston uses the power of simple narrative to drive deep his story's urgent truths."<br> --<b>Los Angeles Times Book Review</b><br> <br>"Expertly done, as spine-chilling a narrative as I've read in recent years."<br> --<b>Chicago Sun Times</b><br> <br>"The first chapter of <b>The Hot Zone</b> is one of the most horrifying things I've ever read in my whole life...What a remarkable piece of work.

That smoky, seared flavor derived from barbecuing is synonymous with summer, carefree cuisine and great grilled gastronomy. </p><p>Now, there's a new kid on the barbecue block: the electric indoor grill, which lets you enjoy grilling all year round from the comforts of your kitchen. No fuss, no mess, no fat -- no brainer! </p><p>Indoor grills have taken the North American market by storm, jiving with an increasing penchant for high protein, low-carb meals. They are now widely available at department stores, supermarkets, drugstores and via the Internet. They have become the microwaves of the twenty-first century as the must-have appliance for every household. An estimated 2.5 million indoor grills are sold each year. Indoor grills promise -- and deliver -- convenience, versatility and uncomplicated cooking. What's not to like about that? </p><p>The easy-to-use appliance replicates the outdoor barbecue taste and texture without the worries of singeing your hair, burning the meat, flame flare-ups or any of the other pesky problems associated with outdoor grilling. The result is mouth-watering, grilled, lower-fat fare in mere minutes. </p><p>Ideal for any apartment, house or cottage, your portable indoor grill will create healthy and economical meals, usually in less than fifteen minutes. And, as you'll soon discover, it's wonderful, for more than simply cooking burgers and hot dogs! Indoor grilling is a fast and satisfying way to prepare gourmet meals such as pesto chicken and honey dill salmon with Dijon mustard, or to rustle up your favorite comfort foods such as grilled tuna melts and saucy pork chops. </p><p>True, the indoor grill is perfect for fast and flavorful family meals on busy weekdays when time is of the essence. You'll come to rely on homemade teriyaki chicken breasts, perfect panini and fast fajitas. You'll rarely be tempted to go the fast-food route when you can so easily prepare your own fast food -- from chicken nuggets to maple-glazed pork chops to the ultimate hamburger -- on the indoor grill in less time than it takes to order in a pizza. </p><p>However, the indoor grill is also suited to entertaining dinner guests. You can skillfully grill succulent pepper steak, lamb kofte, coconut mango chicken or honey orange salmon with thyme. For a cocktail party, whip up bacon-wrapped scallops, spicy shrimp kabobs, tempura vegetables and grilled eggplant baba ghanouj. Brunch or lunch favorites include French toast, grilled cheese and asparagus rolls, Reuben sandwiches, chicken Caesar salad and Thai noodle salad. </p><p>Not only can you can create classy, delicious cuisine for family and friends. hut you can do it quickly and almost effortlessly. You can marinate meat, poultry, fish or seafood earlier in the day and prepare all of the accompaniments, such as rice pilaf, vegetables and salad, in advance. When your guests arrive, you can grill the "all set to go" appetizers (most are ready in minutes!), enjoy time visiting and then grill the main entr�e just before you are ready to sit down to dinner. Entertaining doesn't get much easier than that! </p><p>Unlike with a backyard barbecue, there's no need to constantly check, flip and fret about your grill grub or be anxious about running out of propane. No worries, either, about whether the food will be charred on the outside but undercooked on the inside. The uniform heat of the indoor grill results in evenly and thoroughly cooked foods, especially in the covered contact grill, which I highly recommend. </p><p>One of the most enticing aspects of the indoor grill is its accessibility. You don't need to be a barbecue authority, or even have outdoor barbecue experience. Anyone can learn to indoor grill, and with the help of 125 Best Indoor Grill Recipes, you will become hooked on the fabulous fish, the moist boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs, the flavorful steaks and burgers. And you will be amazed at the mealtime options open to you, rain or shine, when you can confidently assume grilling duties and count on your handy indoor grill to serve up speedy suppertime solutions. </p><p>If you already own an indoor grill, you'll discover a world of possibilities you may never have considered. If you're a novice indoor griller, you will be amazed at what this little appliance can do for your dinner menu. </p><p>You will love my innovative twist on typically deep-fried faves such as grilled southern fried chicken, jalape�o poppers and tempura shrimp and vegetables. And my original indoor grill recipes such as chicken and bean burritos, blackened red fish and veal Parmagiana will motivate you to adapt your own favorites to the indoor grill. I have also included a myriad of marinades to season and spice up main entree meats, poultry and fish.

In I Hear, a child listens to his Grandpa's wristwatch and his baby sister's yelp.

The "I" in the title of each book says it all; the toddler is at the center of his or her cozy universe. Oxenbury's rosy babies are characteristically winsome.

Rhetoric Alive! Book 1: Principles of Persuasion, written by Alyssan Barnes, an experienced rhetoric teacher with a PhD in rhetoric, is a clear, compelling, and delightful text on rhetorical theory and practice. The highly engaging Rhetoric Alive! explores the principles of winsome speech as developed in the foremost text on persuasion, Aristotle&#39;s Rhetoric. The fifteen chapters of Rhetoric Alive! step through the essential components of persuasion: the three appeals; Ethos (speaker&#39;s credibility), Pathos (audience&#39;s emotion), and Logos (argument&#39;s reasoning), the three types of speech; Deliberative (exhort or dissuade), Ceremonial (praise or blame), Judicial (accuse or defend), and the five canons; Invention, Organization, Style, Memory, Delivery. Each chapter includes an exemplary classic text for analysis and discussion, spanning from Pericles&#39;s &#39;Funeral Oration&#39; to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#39;s, &#39;Letter from Birmingham Jail.&#39; Students also have plenty of practice developing their own rhetorical skill through weekly workshops, imitation assignments, and oratory presentations.</p><p>Rhetoric Alive! is a highly knowledgeable, comprehensive, and clear Aristotelian treatment of the art of rhetoric. . . . Its virtues are many, but two are especially prominent: its patient pedagogy and its detailed and interesting exercises. . . . This is a living rhetoric bound to animate the spoken and written suasions of any teacher or student who submits to its instruction. (Taken from the foreword.) --Scott F. Crider, PhD, Author of The Office of Assertion: An Art of Rhetoric for the Academic Essay<br><br>This text has the potential to shake up English studies at the secondary level. It is a formidable and appealing innovation that is wonderfully old-fashioned and yet as fresh as anything I've seen in a long time. --John Briggs, PhD, Director, University Writing Program, UC Riverside<br><br>Rhetoric Alive! moves Aristotle's ideas and concepts out of the classical past and sets them on the bottom shelf for high school students and the accomplishment is that it does so without reducing them, but instead revealing their relevance and worth. It delivers on the aspiration of the title: It brings Aristotle's Rhetoric alive. --Craig Doerksen, Head of the School of Rhetoric, Regents School of Austin</p><h2>Purpose Driven Youth Ministry: 9 Essential Foundations for Healthy Growth (Youth Specialties (Paperback))</h2><p><p>For the past decade, youth pastors around the world have used the bestselling <em>Purpose Driven Youth Ministry</em> to help guide them as they build a healthy youth ministry that is aimed at impacting the lives of teenagers.

What The Purpose-Driven Church has done for pastoral ministry, this book is about to do for youth ministry. Doug Fields, the youth pastor at Rick Warren&#39;s Saddleback Church, reveals the foundations for a powerful, Purpose-Driven? Youth Ministry (PDYM). Youth leaders passionate about a ministry that fulfills the five scriptural purposes of evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, ministry, and worship will discover a proven, team approach that reduces burnout and incorporates the strengths of the church as a whole. What they won&#39;t get is another Six Easy Steps book. Says Fields, You will not find the PDYM to be a cookie-cutter approach promoting do it my way because there&#39;s only one way. Rather, it&#39;s a model that can be adapted to fit the unique needs, personality, and circumstances of any church. Developing a Purpose-Driven? Youth Ministry is a flexible and exhaustive approach to building a healthy, self-sustaining youth ministry based on nine components: Power of God Purpose Potential Audience Programs Process Planned Values Participating Leaders Parents Personnel Here in detail and depth is the theory behind effective youth ministry. And here is the application--the means for translating sound principles into practical action.

For almost twenty years, I&#39;ve been living with the overwhelming responsibility to develop a youth ministry that equips students rather than a youth ministry that coordinates events, says Fields. I don&#39;t want to direct programs; I want to disciple students. This book captures the sweep of Fields&#39; experience and vision.

For more information, visit LornaByrne.com.A Message of Hope from the Angels <br><br> <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br>A message of hope for these challenging times<br> <br>&#x201c;THE ANGEL OF HOPE IS A BEACON OF LIGHT IN all our lives. He helps to keep the light of hope burning inside all of us throughout our lives,&#x201d; the angel told me. &#x201c;Hope plays an enormous part in everyone&#x2019;s life. Hope makes the impossible possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was about twelve years old when an angel told me this.<br> <br>I have been seeing and talking with angels since I was a little baby. I see angels every day and I see them physically as I see someone sitting in front of me. Angels are my friends and companions and I talk with them all the time, sometimes using words and sometimes without words. I have no idea why I should be able to see angels and you don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just an ordinary person.<br> <br>I had seen the Angel of Hope previously, but this day when I was twelve was the first time that I learned who this particular angel was and how he helps us.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope doesn&#x2019;t look like any other angel I have ever seen. He looks like a massive flame. Within this very bright flame, I am shown a faint human appearance, which is masculine, and a beautiful dazzling emerald green color, holding a torch&#x2014;like an Olympic flame. The brightness of the Angel of Hope looks different to any other angel; I think this is because it&#x2019;s a light within a light.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope is enormous, the height of a mature tree. When I see him, he always seems to be very far away from me. So he should then look small, but he&#x2019;s always massive. It&#x2019;s quite strange&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as if he&#x2019;s very far away but right in front of me at the same time, hard as that is to explain.<br> <br>He seems to be forever moving, turning back constantly to encourage whoever he is leading at the time with a gentle smile. His expression is one of love and encouragement.<br> <br>Lately I have been seeing the Angel of Hope a lot more than I would have previously. I probably see him every day. People seem to be needing hope so much at this time.<br> <br>All those years ago, the angel showed me a vision of the Angel of Hope at work, so that I could understand more about him. I was shown the Angel of Hope guiding soldiers through a trench battlefield. I have no idea what nationality the soldiers were. I was shown one particular soldier crawling exhausted through the mud. I could see he was injured. The Angel of Hope was moving in front of him, constantly beckoning him forward. I was allowed to see through the soldier&#x2019;s eyes. The soldier could not see the Angel of Hope, but he saw a light, and within this light the soldier could see those he loved&#x2014;his wife and young children, his elderly parents. The Angel of Hope was giving him the strength to stay alive, encouraging him not to give up, by giving him hope of a reunion with the family he loved.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you understand, Lorna?&#x201d; the angel said. &#x201c;The Angel of Hope can&#x2019;t stop the war, heal this soldier, or rescue him, but he can give him the strength to make it to where he can be rescued.&#x201d; The angel smiled at me and continued. &#x201c;That soldier died in his bed many years later.&#x201d; I was so pleased with this news. The love that the young soldier had for his family was very beautiful.<br> <br>Whenever things have been difficult for me and my family I see the Angel of Hope there, trying to give me encouragement. This is in addition to my guardian angel and the other angels who will be around me helping.<br> <br>I remember one particular period&#x2014;being very stressed and worried about whether my husband, Joe, would get a job. He had been sick for a long time and off work but was now well enough to work. This was the 1980s in Ireland, though: things were tough, and jobs were hard to find. We had three children to feed, and I used to worry desperately. I kept on seeing the Angel of Hope, in the distance, turning toward me and smiling in encouragement. He kept the hope burning inside of me that Joe would eventually be successful in getting one of the jobs that he had applied for. It was quite a while before he did, and I was almost despairing&#x2014;but not quite. Seeing the Angel of Hope kept me going throughout this difficult period and helped me in giving encouragement and support to Joe. Joe was eventually successful in finding employment.<br> <br>The importance of hope should never be underestimated. With hope in our heart, we can do so much.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I know a family whose second child was born with severe genetic difficulties. The doctors had told the parents that there was only a small chance their little girl would walk. The first time I saw this child, she was about nine months old. As her parents chatted to me with her in her father&#x2019;s arms, they were surrounded by angels who were very tall, a bright translucent, white and gave a female appearance. I could vaguely see wings. As with all angels, they were extremely beautiful. One of the angels told me, without words, that this family would not give up hope that this child would walk, no matter what the doctors said. As we talked, the father put the baby on the floor, and the angels around her encouraged her to move her legs and kick.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope appeared for one moment. His light was so bright, and it was as if everything disappeared except for the parents and the child. It was as if the parents could see the light of the Angel of Hope and could see his encouraging smile and were being filled with the light of hope. I know that every time they encountered a problem in relation to their daughter, the Angel of Hope would instill in them the courage to keep going.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope is one angel, but he is there to help everyone and can be in many places at once. In this he is like an archangel. He is there, briefly, whenever people need hope to lead them on and give them courage. Of course, other angels help to give us hope too.<br> <br>I see a guardian angel with everyone, regardless of their religion or nationality. I have never seen anyone, anywhere in the world, without a guardian angel. Your guardian angel is with you from before you are conceived until after your death and never leaves you even for one moment. It loves you unconditionally and will do everything possible to guide you through life and keep you filled with hope. Your guardian angel can let other angels in to help you too.<br> <br>A year or so later, I saw the child again. There were lots of adults there, and the child was being passed from one to another, the focus of everyone&#x2019;s love and attention. The child looked so bright to me, and the angels told me it was because of the level of encouragement the whole family was giving to the child. They were clearly all listening to their guardian angels and playing their part. At one stage, the father put the little one standing beside him. It was beautiful to see the angels encircling the child to try and keep her wobbly little legs strong, to stop them from giving under her. She is now three and she is walking. Not only is she walking, but they had brought her to the beach recently, and she had started to run&#x2014;if not very steadily.<br> <br>The parents and all of the family kept the light of hope burning for this child. They helped her to walk and are now hoping she will learn to talk properly too. This child is a beacon of hope, and the light of this hope has lit up the family, filling them and giving them hope in other areas of their lives. And it&#x2019;s not just the immediate family&#x2014;the wider family and neighbors have been inspired and filled with hope as a result of this example.<br> <br><br> <br>I see a lot of angels holding lights<br>in front of people, helping<br>to encourage them.<br> <br><br> <br>I see angels all of the time working hard to give us hope. I was sitting in a hotel reception recently, waiting for a journalist to arrive. The angels with me told me to get up and go and sit in the lounge. There was a man sitting at a low table by the window. On the table in front of him were some papers and a laptop. There were four angels sitting surrounding him. One of the angels was holding a bright light, about the size of a marble, in front of the man at chest height. When I see an angel holding a light in front of someone, I know that the person is having a tough time and that the angel is holding the light to help to give them hope and the courage to keep on going.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>One of the angels told me without words that the man was extremely worried and stressed over his business. I have no idea what his business was. The angels were encouraging him to see a solution, and they told me there was a solution somewhere within the papers, but he was too anxious to see it. One of the angels was trying to calm him down while one of the others kept reaching out and pointing to one particular sheet of paper. When he did this, the man would reach out to the sheet of paper but didn&#x2019;t seem to be seeing the solution. All of the time he was writing notes and crossing things out on his writing pad. At times, the light would get brighter for a moment and, without the angels telling me, I knew that was him seeing a glimpse of a solution, a glimpse of hope, a way out of his business difficulties. I sat there for about twenty minutes, as the journalist was late. I prayed for the businessman to find the solution. My heart went out to him. He looked so stressed and concerned. As I left, I asked the four angels around the table if he would see the solution before the day was out, and I was told that he mightn&#x2019;t see the whole solution but that he would at least have the idea, and over the next few days he would find a solution to the problem.<br> <br>These days I see a lot of angels holding lights in front of people, helping to encourage them. I see angels helping to kindle hope in us all the time&#x2014;hope at an individual, a community, a national, or a global level.<br> <br>Hope often starts with the little initiatives. One evening a few weeks ago, I came across a group of neighbors cleaning up a green near where I live. It&#x2019;s an area which has looked grubby and neglected for a long time. As they worked, they were surrounded by angels, who were whispering in their ears, encouraging them. As I walked past one, the angel said to me, &#x201c;Can you see the hope that is stirred up in these people?&#x201d; I smiled and the angel continued: &#x201c;Through small steps like this they can make their world a better place.&#x201d;<br> <br>The following day, I walked past the green again. I was amazed at how different it was. They had picked up the litter, cut the grass, and tidied up the flowerbed. The entire place felt so much brighter. One of the angels who was there called my attention to a little blackbird that was able to find a worm in the soil they had loosened. I had seen no birds there the day before.<br> <br>Hope brings a community together to make things better, and when it does, I see people get brighter, shine more, and then they can go on to achieve greater things. People who believe things can be changed for the better are beacons of light for us&#x2014;and need to be supported.<br> <br>Hope can be given to others. It gives strength and courage, and then hope grows. We all have a part to play in growing hope. In the past, people looked to leaders of churches, communities, businesses, countries to provide a vision of hope for the future, but now many of our leaders are struggling. They are failing to see the hope that is in front of them. They are failing to see all the ways in which we can make our world a better place to live.<br> <br>The angels have told me so much about hope and how much we have to be hopeful about, and have showed me so many different ways in which they help to give us hope.<br> <br>Everything I share with you in this book is from God and his angels. This book is a message of hope that has been given to me to share with each and every one of you, to help grow the light of hope within you.</p><h2>Awkward Family Photos</h2><p>Based on the hit website, AwkwardFamilyPhotos.com (&#x201c;painful, regrettable, horrifyingly awesome snaps of family bonding, you will laugh so hard that people in adjoining offices will ask what&#x2019;s wrong with you&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Esquire</i>), this full color book features never-before-seen photos and hilarious personal stories covering everything from uncomfortable moments with relatives, teen angst, sibling rivalry, and family vacations from hell.

Kennedy, 1917 - 1963</h2><p>The #1 bestseller that forever changed how we thought about JFK, published with a new epilogue in time for the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination.<br><br>When it was originally published in 2003, AN UNFINISHED LIFE brought to light new revelations about JFK's health, his love affairs, his brothers and father, and the path JFK would have taken in the Vietnam entanglement if he had survived. A blockbuster bestseller, the book was embraced by critics and readers as a landmark assessment of our 35th president. Now, in time for what promises to be remarkable media attention on Kennedy's death and legacy, AN UNFINISHED LIFE returns with a new, strikingly incisive examination by Robert Dallek in which he further assesses JFK's impact and hold on American culture.</p><p>Robert Dallek is one of the most highly regarded historians in America today and<b> </b>the author of more than a dozen books, including his two-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson, <i>Lone Star Rising</i> and <i>Flawed Giant</i>, and <i>Nixon and Kissinger</i>. Currently a faculty member at Stanford University's prestigious Washington program, he has also taught at Boston University, Columbia University, UCLA and Oxford.This newest biography of JFK is indeed a profile in courage. The impression of youthful vigor must have come at great cost because the man was almost always sick and frequently in pain. Richard McGonagle brings the president to life, mimicking the famous accents so well that his renditions of Kennedy speeches compare favorably to Kennedy's own renderings, also available at Audible.com. The biography attempts to hit all the high points, so there are sections where the air is very thin. Yet this listener was grateful just to hear again the voice of an informal, almost self-deprecating leader who, during an earlier time of nuclear instability, was able to say: "Our problems are man-made. Therefore, they can be solved by men."

Ganache can be poured over a cake or whipped to spread on a cake. It also makes a delicious filling. This recipe calls for dark chocolate, but ganache can also be made with white, milk, semi-sweet, or bittersweet chocolate. White chocolate is not technically chocolate because it lacks cocoa powder, but the presence of cocoa butter allows it to work similarly to milk, semi-sweet, or bittersweet chocolate. White chocolate can be colored. Use an oil-based coloring to color white chocolate. The cocoa butter content in the chocolate will affect the thickness of the ganache. A couverture chocolate, or a chocolate with a high amount of cocoa butter, is best for ganache recipes. If using a chocolate with a lower cocoa butter content, the amount of cream can be increased. For the richest, best ganache, use real chocolate with cocoa butter, not candy coating, which has various oils. Candy coating is an affordable alternative and may be used, although the quality of the ganache will not be as good.</p><p><b>Ganache Recipe</b></p><p>- 3 tablespoons (42 g) unsalted butter</p><p>- 1/3 cup (80 g) whipping cream</p><p>- 8 ounces (227 g) dark chocolate</p><p>In a heavy duty saucepan, combine cream and butter. Cook on medium heat until it boils. Remove from heat. Add the chocolate and stir until almost all the chocolate is melted. Whisk the ganache until it is thoroughly melted and the icing is glossy. If chocolate has not completely melted, place the saucepan back on the stove. Heat on warm or very low until the chocolate is melted. Pour or spoon over cake.</p><p>Yields: 1 1/2 cups (375 mL)</p><p><b>Quality Counts: </b>Chocolate will differ tremendously in flavor, texture, and thickness. The taste and quality of the ganache will depend on the chocolate used. Choose chocolate that is delicious and melts in your mouth when eaten out of the package, and it will make a fantastic ganache.</p><p><b>Storing Ganache</b></p><p>A cake covered in ganache can be kept at room temperature for one to two days. Unused ganache should be kept in the refrigerator. Ganache can be reheated by placing the ganache in the top pan of a double boiler over warm water. If a whipped ganache is desired, allow ganache to come to room temperature before whipping. Ganache may be reheated in the microwave for 5&#x2013;10 seconds. Stir, then heat again if necessary, until ganache is desired thickness.</p></p><h2>Logic: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Logic is often perceived as having little to do with the rest of philosophy, and even less to do with real life. In this lively and accessible introduction, Graham Priest shows how wrong this conception is. He explores the philosophical roots of the subject, explaining how modern formal logic deals with issues ranging from the existence of God and the reality of time to paradoxes of probability and decision theory. Along the way, the basics of formal logic are explained in simple, non-technical terms, showing that logic is a powerful and exciting part of modern philosophy. <br><br>In this new edition Graham Priest expands his discussion to cover the subjects of algorithms and axioms, and proofs in mathematics.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

This framework will touch everything in your kitchen from your ingredients, tools, pantry, to your cooking techniques, meal planning, and shopping habits. Once the framework is in place, you can make 100+ wholesome, mix and match recipes. You'll find Blueberry-Orange Breakfast Rolls, Banana-Coconut Baked Oatmeal, White Wine Spring Pasta, BBQ Black Bean and Quick Slaw Tacos, Crispy Pizza with Caramelized Onions, Chickpea Tikka Masala, Stovetop Mac and Cheese, and Two-Bowl Carrot Cupcakes.<br> <br> It&#x2019;s true what they say&#x2014;less is more. But this is also true&#x2014;achieving simplicity is difficult. How do you know what to keep and what to get rid of? This comprehensive guide will hold your hand through the process and make dinnertime (and the kitchen) feel doable again. For best results, read this cookbook like a novel, from the beginning. Chapter 1: The Minimalist Kitchen sets the stage for how to make and use the recipes in Chapters 2&#x2013;8: Breakfast, Main Dishes, Burgers Wraps &amp; Sandwiches, Soups &amp; Salads, Sides, Drinks, Dessert. Melissa&#x2019;s recipes are the practical application of the minimalist kitchen&#x2014;using a pared down kitchen to its full potential. You&#x2019;ll find them to be vegetable forward and simple without compromising flavor. They&#x2019;re intentionally designed to fit the rhythm of the week and labeled weekday, weekend, and make ahead accordingly. Weekday recipes are quick and efficient, while weekend recipes are slower and celebratory. Some recipes have make ahead components to increase efficiency and break up prep times. You&#x2019;ll find ingredient lists ranging from 3 to 20 ingredients. But don&#x2019;t be scared by the longer list, as most of the ingredients are sitting in your well-stocked pantry. Look for Melissa's minimalist tips offering recipe-specific advice, a seasonal produce guide, and a handy metric equivalents chart to take the stress out of cooking.</p><p><b>Melissa Coleman</b> is a home cook and baker,&nbsp;designer, wife, mama, and minimalist.

Lois Ehlert&#x2019;s seasonal classic--available for the first time as a board book--will inspire even the youngest snowman-builders. And it&#x2019;s just in time for winter! <br></p><p><b>LOIS EHLERT</b> has created many award-winning picture books, including, most recently, <i>Waiting for Wings.</i> She lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. <br>PreSchool-Grade 2?Ehlert once again displays the innovative collage style that so vividly celebrated spring and summer in Growing Vegetable Soup (1990) and Planting a Rainbow (1988), and autumn in Red Leaf, Yellow Leaf (1991) and Nuts to You! (1993, all Harcourt). Here, she puts a creative twist on one of the favorite traditions of winter?building a snowman, or, in this case, a snow family, including pets. Children who believe snowmen must have charcoal eyes and carrot noses will be inspired by the unique adornments, for each creation here is decorated with the narrator's cache of "good stuff in a sack." Mom's hair is a Guatemalan belt; boy's nose is a toy compass; baby's arms are plastic picnic forks; dog's spots are a collection of buttons. As in the previous books, bold, rhyming text describes the simple pleasures of the season. The contrasting sensations of the crisp iciness and dreary isolation of winter are effectively created by placing the colorfully decorated white figures against a textured gray background on double-page vertical spreads. The background glows bright orange as the sun appears. Ehlert concludes her book with some winter facts, photographs of snowmen, and a recipe for popcorn balls.

But Christian parents know that teaching good morals isn't enough. Kids (and adults) need gospel power in order to wise up! </p><p><i>Wise Up</i>, the newest family devotional from best-selling children's author and family pastor, Marty Machowski, will help make learning the truths of Proverbs fun and memorable for first- to sixth-grade kids as it points them to the true wisdom that is only found in Jesus Christ. </p> <p>Like his acclaimed <i>Long Story Short</i> and <i>Old Story New</i> devotionals, <i>Wise Up</i> offers Christian families an easy-to-use, gospel-focused resource that can be successfully completed in just ten minutes a day, five days per week. Each session features Bible reading, discussion questions, a fun activity, and a song to make the study memorable for everyone in the family. In twelve short weeks, you can walk your entire family through the book of Proverbs, keeping them focused on the gospel the whole time.</p> <p>Unlike some other kids resources on Proverbs, <i>Wise Up</i> is not a study on good morals. Machowski examines Proverbs from a biblical-theological perspective avoiding the dangers of moralism while still teaching gospel-motivated good choices. Each wisdom theme in <i>Wise Up</i> is carefully and repeatedly connected to the good news of Jesus's life, death, resurrection, and coming return. Ultimately, the goal of this family devotional is to present the wisdom of Solomon against the backdrop of the gospel to show children that real wisdom comes only as we depend on Jesus for daily help and forgiveness. As a result, <i>Wise Up</i> moves Christian families beyond the practical wisdom of Proverbs, to connect the teaching of Solomon to God's larger story of salvation. </p> <p>A corresponding music CD, <i>Walking with the Wise</i>, helps families remember and reflect on these truths and is available from Sovereign Grace Music.</p></p><p><p><b>Marty Machowski</b> is a Family Life Pastor at Covenant Fellowship Church, a Sovereign Grace Ministries church in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, where he has served on the pastoral staff for over twenty years.

At least, he was . . . before a runaway circus elephant named Pickles stampeded into his life, needing a friend. Pickles is larger than life and overflowing with imagination. She takes Pete swandiving off Niagara Falls. (Sort of.) And sledding down the Matterhorn. (Sort of.) Pete goes along for the wild ride and actually begins to enjoy himself . . . until Pickles goes too far. And Pete tells her she must leave.<p> Yet sometimes the simple life isn?t all it?s cracked up to be.</p><p> Pulitzer Prize?winning cartoonist Berkeley Breathed offers two new irresistible characters and a heartfelt, hilarious look at the rarity of true friendship.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p><b>Berkeley Breathed</b>&nbsp;(www.berkeleybreathed.com) is the Pulitzer Prize-winning creator of the renowned comic strips "Bloom County," "Outland," and "Opus" which have appeared in over 1,200 newspapers worldwide and have earned Berkeley millions of loyal fans.

He lives and works in Santa Barbara, California.Grade 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Pete is a predictable and practical pig. One stormy night, his world is turned upside down when he encounters Pickles, an elephant on the lam from the circus, in his room. Pickles is anything but predictable, yet Pete finds himself drawn to her, and the two become unlikely friends. The relationship hits a snag when Pickles treads too far, and Pete makes a decision that ends up endangering both of their lives. This heartwarming tale is packed with adventure, imagination, and the all-important message of accepting differences. The illustrations alternate from naturalistic renderings of fantastical scenarios to flat compositions reminiscent of traditional comic strips. In the former, Pete and Pickles seem to pop off the page in the lush landscapes, and it is in these pages that the story soars. Less-discerning readers may miss plot points expressed in the drawings but not in the text.

In a series of in-depth interviews and explanations he covers five crucial segments of the Old Testament: 1. Job: Seeing in the Dark 2. Deuteronomy: A Taste of Bittersweet 3. Psalms: Spirituality in Every Key 4. Ecclesiastes: The End of Wisdom 5. The Prophets: God Talks Back Philip approaches each of these major segments from a different point of view--from the paradoxes of Ecclesiastes to the poetry of the Psalms--and adds additional interpretive material extending the reach of his best-selling book. He teams again with the Emmy Award-winning production team responsible for video production of the "What's So Amazing About Grace?" Zondervan Groupware. Many Christians tend to ignore the Old Testament or dismiss it as impenetrable and obscure. Philip Yancey's combination of scholarship and insight brings new light to old material and stimulates new discussion, thought, and further study.</p></p><p>Philip Yancey, editor at large and columnist for <i>Christianity Today</i>, follows up his back-to-back bestselling books, <i>What's So Amazing About Grace</i> and <i>The Jesus I Never Knew</i>, with <i>The Bible Jesus Read</i>, an exploration of the significance of the Old Testament to today's Christian.<p> Given previous book titles--<i>Where Is God When It Hurts</i>, <i>Disappointment with God</i>, and <i>The Gift of Pain</i>--one might jokingly suggest that in the Old Testament Yancey has found his true home. He acknowledges that in studying key sections of the Hebrew Bible (he concentrates on Job, Deuteronomy, The Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and the Prophets) he found himself confronted by the core questions that haunt his Christian faith: Do I matter? Does God care? Why doesn't God act? As always, Yancey explores these central human questions with a style that is marked by directness, humor, and honesty. He writes not as theologian or mystic but as a questioning seeker. Rather than providing simple answers--he in fact says that "by no means did Jesus resolve the problem of pain"--he instead affirms the words of Thomas Merton, which he quotes in his Introduction: "There is ... nothing comfortable about the Bible--until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves." </p><p> Even as he finds the Old Testament a "companion for my pilgrimage," so is Yancey a companion for his readers, precisely through his willingness to ask --and his courage not to answer--all the hard questions. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Philip Yancey has a way of confronting our most cherished--but misguided--notions about the Christian life. In his newest book, Yancey challenges the perception that the New Testament is more important than the Old, that the Hebrew Scriptures aren&#39;t worth the time they take to read and understand them. Writing as always with keen insight into the human condition and God&#39;s provision for it, Yancey debunks this theory once and for all. Yes, he agrees, the Old Testament can be baffling, boring, and even offensive to the modern reader. But as he personally discovered, the Old Testament is full of rewards for the one who embraces its riches. With his candid, signature style, Yancey unfolds his interactions with the Old Testament from the perspective of his own deeply personal journey. From Moses, the amazing prince of Egypt, to the psalmists&#39; turbulent emotions and the prophets&#39; oddball rantings, Yancey paints a picture of Israel&#39;s God--and ours--that fills in the blanks of a solely New Testament vision of the Almighty. As he reconnects for us the strong, sinuous chords that bind Old and New Testaments, Yancey reclaims the Reformers&#39; deep sense of unity between the two. Most important, he says, reading the Scriptures that Jesus so revered gives believers a profound new understanding of Christ, the Cornerstone of the new covenant. The more we comprehend the Old Testament, Yancey writes, the more we comprehend Jesus.</p><h2>Firefly: Generations</h2><p><b><b>The third original novel tying into the critically acclaimed and much-missed </b><b><i>Firefly</i></b><b> series from creator Joss Whedon.</b><br><b></b></b><br><br>Mal wins an old map in a card game.

Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies, University of Massachussetts, Amherst<br></p> <p>The Irish came to America in the eighteenth century, fleeing a homeland under foreign occupation and a caste system that regarded them as the lowest form of humanity. In the new country &#x2013; a land of opportunity &#x2013; they found a very different form of social hierarchy, one that was based on the color of a person&#x2019;s skin. Noel Ignatiev&#x2019;s 1995 book &#x2013; the first published work of one of America&#x2019;s leading and most controversial historians &#x2013; tells the story of how the oppressed became the oppressors; how the new Irish immigrants achieved acceptance among an initially hostile population only by proving that they could be more brutal in their oppression of African Americans than the nativists. This is the story of <em>How the Irish Became White</em>.</p></p><p><p><strong>Noel Ignatiev</strong> (b. 1940) is best known for his call to abolish the white race. He was a co-founder and co-editor of the journal Race Traitor (an anthology from which won an American Book Award), and a co-founder of the New Abolitionist Society. He teaches history at the Massachusetts College of Art. American History</p>In the first half of the 19th century, some three million Irish emigrated to America, trading a ruling elite of Anglo-Irish Anglicans for one of WASPs. The Irish immigrants were (self-evidently) not Anglo-Saxon; most were not Protestant; and, as far as many of the nativists were concerned, they weren't white, either. Just how, in the years surrounding the Civil War, the Irish evolved from an oppressed, unwelcome social class to become part of a white racial class is the focus of Harvard lecturer Ignatiev's well-researched, intriguing although haphazardly structured book. By mid-century, Irish voting solidarity gave them political power, a power augmented by the brute force of groups descended from the Molly Maguires. With help, the Irish pushed blacks out of the lower-class jobs and neighborhoods they had originally shared. And though many Irish had been oppressed by the Penal Laws, they opposed abolition?even when Daniel O'Connell, "the Liberator," threatened that Irish-Americans who countenanced slavery would be recognized "as Irishmen no longer." The book's structure lacks cohesion: chapters zigzag chronologically and geographically, and Ignatiev's writing is thick with redundancies and overlong digressions. But for the careful reader, he offers much to think about and an important perspective on the American history of race and class. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook</h2><p><b>The instant <i>New York Times </i>bestseller. <br><br>A brilliant recasting of the turning points in world history, including the one we're living through, as a collision between old power hierarchies and new social networks.<br><br>&#x201c;Captivating and compelling.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The&nbsp;</i><b><i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Niall Ferguson has again written a brilliant book...In 400 pages you will have restocked your mind.

It's about states, armies and corporations. It's about orders from on high. Even history "from below" is often about trade unions and workers' parties. But what if that's simply because hierarchical institutions create the archives that historians rely on? What if we are missing the informal, less well documented social networks that are the true sources of power and drivers of change?<br><br>The 21st century has been hailed as the Age of Networks. However, in <i>The Square and the Tower</i>, Niall Ferguson argues that networks have always been with us, from the structure of the brain to the food chain, from the family tree to freemasonry. Throughout history, hierarchies housed in high towers have claimed to rule, but often real power has resided in the networks in the town square below. For it is networks that tend to innovate. And it is through networks that revolutionary ideas can contagiously spread. Just because conspiracy theorists like to fantasize about such networks doesn't mean they are not real. <br><br>From the cults of ancient Rome to the dynasties of the Renaissance, from the founding fathers to Facebook, <i>The Square and the Tower</i> tells the story of the rise, fall and rise of networks, and shows how network theory--concepts such as clustering, degrees of separation, weak ties, contagions and phase transitions--can transform our understanding of both the past and the present.<br><br>Just as <i>The Ascent of Money</i> put Wall Street into historical perspective, so <i>The Square and the Tower</i> does the same for Silicon Valley. And it offers a bold prediction about which hierarchies will withstand this latest wave of network disruption--and which will be toppled.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is one of the world's most renowned historians.

Whether describing the surprisingly ineffective 18th century network of the mysterious Illuminati that continue to be the subject of crank conspiracy theorists or the shockingly effective 20th century network of Cambridge University spies working for the Soviets, Ferguson manages both to tell a good story and provide important insight into the specific qualities that power successful networks.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The&nbsp;New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Remarkably interesting . . . always surprising and always thought-provoking in the places and entities it chooses to pause and examine, everything from the Mafia to the Soviet Union of Stalin. . . . <i>The Square and the Tower</i> in addition to being provocative history, may prove to be a bellwether work of the Internet Age.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>"Niall Ferguson has again written a brilliant book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Never before has there been such a richly illustrated, thorough, and entertaining celebration of the history of making fine distilled spirits. Take a trip through moonshining&#x2019;s past: travel from its beginnings as a pioneer staple to the dark days of prohibition, from quickly produced urban rotgut to today&#x2019;s carefully handcrafted artisanal libations. Get in on the fun with how-to instructions that take into account all legal regulations and requirements before covering ingredients, building a still, basic distilling techniques, and dozens of recipes, all adapted for the beginner. Whiskies, brandies, grappa, schnapps: they&#x2019;re all here, along with dozens of page-turning quotes, song lyrics, and vintage photographs and illustrations.<br>&#x201c;Making whisky or brandy is not the least bit difficult. Making something you&#x2019;d want to drink...well, that may take some practice.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014;Matthew B. Rowley</p><p>Food historian Rowley wants readers of this home-distillation guide to know something about alcohol and the law: "Without inspection and proper approvals, you are not permitted to make any amount for personal use. Not one drop." That said, Rowley provides clear and well-illustrated instructions for building a still, preparing a mash and distilling alcohol right in your own backyard. It's a complicated process, requiring a fire extinguisher, the skills of a good metalsmith and plenty of patience. For those without the time or skill, however, Rowley includes plenty of appealing recipes for cordials and cocktails that don't require homemade spirits. Fish House Punch, rumored to have left George Washington with a "crippling hangover," is a powerful mix of bourbon, peach brandy, Benedictine and dark rum. Simpler, and similarly all-American, is Cherry Bounce, made with bourbon, honey and a gallon of sweet and sour cherries. But Rowley's mother provides perhaps the best recipe, an easy maceration of fruit and sugar that tastes great over ice cream or on its own. Rounded out with trivia, tall tales and a brief history of bootlegging, a list of home brewing resources and a few warnings for drinkers ("Even for accomplished boozers, moonshine can make off with your dignity before you understand what's happening"), this may be the last book one will ever need on the art of in-house hooch. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It concerns me to see you in detention,&#x201d; said Ms. Lily. &#x201c;I know you love science, and your curiosity is admirable. But it has its limits. You can&#x2019;t just help yourself to school equipment after hours. Am I making myself clear?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Ms. Lily,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;The rules are for everyone to follow. You don&#x2019;t get special treatment because your dad&#x2019;s a teacher here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, Ms. Lily. I didn&#x2019;t mean . . .&#x201d; Ms. Lily held up her hand, and Ada closed her mouth. She&#x2019;d always gotten along well with her principal. It didn&#x2019;t feel good to be in trouble with her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you know. But it doesn&#x2019;t hurt for you to hear it from me. Now, let&#x2019;s make sure we don&#x2019;t meet like this again, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Ms. Lily.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Milton was waiting outside. They had been on opposite sides of the room in the same detention.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come you didn&#x2019;t have to talk to her?&#x201d; Ada asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, they&#x2019;re used to seeing me here. Stick with me, kid. They&#x2019;ll get used to you, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; said Ada. Ada and Milton hadn&#x2019;t been doing anything bad. Not really. They had just found a weird bug after school, and they used the science lab to dissect it. Ada had permission to be in the art room after school, with her dad, or outside, but all the other classrooms were off-limits.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;I never thought Ms. Azalea would turn us in. She&#x2019;s usually so nice!&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but the risk is half the fun, right?&#x201d; said Milton.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speak for yourself,&#x201d; said Ada. They got to the west entrance, near Mr. Lace&#x2019;s room. Milton was supposed to meet his mom outside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wanna hang out later?&#x201d; Milton asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah, I have homework,&#x201d; said Ada, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;m not allowed to hang out today anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If Nina can come too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; said Milton. Ada kept hoping that Milton and Nina would start to like each other more. It hadn&#x2019;t happened yet.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The worst part about trying to hang out with Nina and Milton at the same time was that they could never agree on anything. But Ada was determined to make it work. Usually that meant waiting until Nina and Milton both got tired of arguing, and suggesting something that they could agree on. Unfortunately, neither of them was that excited about the compromise. Ada suggested a movie instead of a water balloon toss (Milton) or creating a Juniper Garden swap shop (Nina). They agreed, and Ada was relieved. Then she realized they also had to agree on which movie to go see.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve seen that Wizards of Weird movie,&#x201d; said Milton.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know! But it&#x2019;s totally rewatchable,&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it twice!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Why don&#x2019;t we start with stuff we haven&#x2019;t seen?&#x201d; Ada suggested.<br> <br>That left Teeny Tiny Kitten Frenzy, which was too cute even for Nina, and Mission Probable. Usually Ada didn&#x2019;t like heist movies, but she decided to give it a try. Ada&#x2019;s mom brought them to the theater, and while Ada, Nina, and Milton watched their movie, Ms. Lace, Elliott, and Jack went to see Teeny Tiny Kittens.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys are making such a big mistake,&#x201d; said Elliott. &#x201c;Do you know how many kittens there are???&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, a lot?&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Five hundred and twenty-three!!!&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, give me your review afterward, Elliott. Maybe I&#x2019;ll see it next time.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Ada was surprised at how much she enjoyed Mission Probable. It was pretty easy to figure out what was going to happen next. In fact, Nina kept leaning over to whisper to Ada what was coming up. But there was technology Ada hadn&#x2019;t ever seen in a movie before. It was all kind of rough and homemade looking, which made it seem like a lot of it could be created at home. And some of the ways the thieves navigated the security were different from what she had seen in other movies. For example, instead of slinking around the security laser beams like ninjas, they used mirrors to divert the security beams around them. Nothing looked like it was something from the future. Instead, all their tools looked like something Mr. Peebles might be able to put together. It totally captured Ada&#x2019;s imagination.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;That was so cool, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Milton.<br> <br>&#x201c;A little on the predictable side, don&#x2019;tcha think?&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, like seeing W of W for a third time?&#x201d; said Milton. Nina rolled her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I thought all the tools were cool,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes! Exactly!&#x201d; said Milton. &#x201c;It makes heists look fun.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Too bad they&#x2019;re so illegal,&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;It is kind of too bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>They met Elliott, Jack, and Ms. Lace outside the bathrooms.<br> <br>&#x201c;How was it, Ell?&#x201d; Ada asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A little disappointing,&#x201d; said Elliott. Ada was surprised.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, first of all, there were only four hundred and ninety cats. I&#x2019;m pretty sure they used some of the cats over again,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;And they weren&#x2019;t nearly as fuzzy as I was expecting,&#x201d; said Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, thumbs down?&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just wait for it to stream,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Later that night in bed, as Ada drifted off to sleep, she imagined she was scaling an unbelievably tall building using gecko gloves. She got to the top floor and looked in the window to see Milton. He smiled and waved. Then he opened the window, which tilted outward, and Ada was sent plunging down to the street below. She woke with a gasp. The noise woke George, who instantly played a lullaby. Ada drifted off to sleep again.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The next day in class, the students were assigned a social studies project. They were studying industries in the Bay Area, and the teacher had them work in pairs.<br> <br>Their usual teacher, Ms. Grunflecker, was out on family leave and had been replaced by a substitute, Mr. Parable. He was okay, but he tried way too hard. It was amusing the first day when Mr. Parable wore a tie shaped like a slice of pizza. And then maybe the second day when he wore a fish tie. Then, on the third day, he moved on to a baseball bat tie. And after that they just kept rotating: pizza slice, fish, bat, pizza slice, fish, bat&#x2014;always in that order. It took all the whimsy out of it.<br> <br>He also had a parrot named Ferris Bueller in the classroom. That was fun at first too, but it got annoying really quickly. Every time Mr. Parable asked a question, the parrot would shout, &#x201c;I know! I know!&#x201d; And Mr. Parable would say, &#x201c;Bueller,&#x201d; then the bird would say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; It was clear that Mr. Parable and Bueller had only ever taught for a week at a time. They ran out of material by the second week.<br> <br><br> <br>Even worse, if you left your desk to sharpen your pencil, the bird would say, &#x201c;Have a seat! Have a seat!&#x201d; And Mr. Parable would always take the bird&#x2019;s side!<br> <br>Nina was much more tolerant of the sub, but even she started to complain when Mr. Parable assigned partners and she got Milton.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was that guy&#x2019;s biggest champion,&#x201d; said Nina, &#x201c;and he sticks me with Milton? Doesn&#x2019;t he know who his friends are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on! Milton&#x2019;s not so bad,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that because you guys are buddies now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but doesn&#x2019;t that count?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>At dinner Ada complained to her mom about the parrot.<br> <br>&#x201c;His name&#x2019;s Ferris Bueller?&#x201d; said Ms. Lace, laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Why is that funny?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s just from this great movie from the . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The nineties?&#x201d; said Ada. She was usually interested in her parents&#x2019; lives before she was born, but she was sick of Bueller.<br> <br>&#x201c;From the eighties, actually, Ada,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace. &#x201c;And it wasn&#x2019;t that great a movie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on! It&#x2019;s a classic!&#x201d; said Ms. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;Citizen Kane is a classic,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, the parrot is annoying,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to agree with you there,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>That night, just as Ada was falling asleep, Milton called her on the ham. Ada&#x2019;s parents had rules about this: no calls after 8:30 p.m. She tried to ignore him, but Milton was persistent.<br> <br>KD8PKR. KD8PKR. This is KD86E. Over.<br> <br>KD8PKR! Psssstttt! Ada? It&#x2019;s Milton.<br> <br>Milton. What do you want? I&#x2019;m trying to . . .<br> <br>I have some great ideas for a heist!<br> <br>Okay, well, good luck to you. I&#x2019;m not a thief, and I&#x2019;m not supposed to be . . .<br> <br>Of course, it was then that Mr. Lace came in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ada? What did we say about the radio? Good night, Milton,&#x201d; he said into the mic and clicked it off.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was trying to tell him, but . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t even have the radio on after bedtime,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;I forgot! I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Next time, you&#x2019;re going to lose it for a week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t my fault!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good night, Adita.&#x201d; He gave her a kiss on the forehead. &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m glad that you and Milton are getting along better, but you may want to set some limits for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;I can already feel the trouble starting to rub off on me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we can&#x2019;t have that,&#x201d; Mr. Lace said as he closed Ada&#x2019;s door.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The next day during social studies, Ada&#x2019;s partner was missing.

In that first dazed moment, as my eyes open, I have no thoughts; I am only a smooth-skinned, tightly muscled young body, a woman of twenty-six, slowly waking with joy to life. I have no sense of my immortal soul, I have no sense of sin or guilt. I am so deliciously, lazily sleepy that I hardly know who I am.<br> <br>Slowly, I open my eyes and realize that the light coming through the shutters means that it is late in the morning. As I stretch out, luxuriously, like a waking cat, I remember that I was exhausted when I fell asleep and now I feel rested and well. And then, all in a moment, as if reality had suddenly tumbled down on my head like glossy-sealed denouncements from a high shelf, I remember that I am not well, that nothing is well, that this is the morning I hoped would never come; for this morning I cannot deny my deadly name: I am the heir of royal blood, and my brother&#x2014;guilty as I am guilty&#x2014;is dead.<br> <br>My husband, sitting on the side of my bed, is fully dressed in his red velvet waistcoat, his jacket making him bulky and wide, his gold chain of office as chamberlain to the Prince of Wales splayed over his broad chest. Slowly, I realize he has been waiting for me to wake, his face crumpled with worry. &#x201c;Margaret?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say anything,&#x201d; I snap like a child, as if stopping the words will delay the facts, and I turn away from him into the pillow.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must be brave,&#x201d; he says hopelessly. He pats my shoulder as if I were a sick hound puppy. &#x201c;You must be brave.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t dare to shrug him off. He is my husband, I dare not offend him. He is my only refuge. I am buried in him, my name hidden in his. I am cut off from my title as sharply as if my name had been beheaded and rolled away into a basket.<br> <br>Mine is the most dangerous name in England: Plantagenet, and once I carried it proudly, like a crown. Once I was Margaret Plantagenet of York, niece of two kings, the brothers Edward IV and Richard III, and the third brother was my father, George, Duke of Clarence. My mother was the wealthiest woman in England and the daughter of a man so great that they called him &#x201c;Kingmaker.&#x201d; My brother, Teddy, was named by our uncle, King Richard, as heir to the throne of England, and between us&#x2014;Teddy and me&#x2014;we commanded the love and the loyalty of half the kingdom. We were the noble Warwick orphans, saved from fate, snatched from the witchy grip of the white queen, raised in the royal nursery at Middleham Castle by Queen Anne herself, and nothing, nothing in the world was too good or too rich or too rare for us.<br> <br>But when King Richard was killed, we went overnight from being the heirs to the throne to becoming pretenders, survivors of the old royal family, while a usurper took the throne. What should be done with the York princesses? What should be done with the Warwick heirs? The Tudors, mother and son, had the answer prepared. We would all be married into obscurity, wedded to shadows, hidden in wedlock. So now I am safe, cut down by degrees, until I am small enough to conceal under a poor knight&#x2019;s name in a little manor in the middle of England where land is cheap and there is nobody who would ride into battle for the promise of my smile at the cry of &#x201c;� Warwick!&#x201d;.<br> <br>I am Lady Pole. Not a princess, not a duchess, not even a countess, just the wife of a humble knight, stuffed into obscurity like an embroidered emblem into a forgotten clothes chest. Margaret Pole, young pregnant wife to Sir Richard Pole, and I have already given him three children, two of them boys. One is Henry, named sycophantically for the new king, Henry VII, and one is Arthur, named ingratiatingly for his son Prince Arthur, and I have a daughter, Ursula. I was allowed to call a mere girl whatever I wanted, so I named her for a saint who chose death rather than be married to a stranger and forced to take his name. I doubt that anyone has observed this small rebellion of mine; I certainly hope not.<br> <br>But my brother could not be rechristened by marriage. Whoever he married, however lowly she was, she could not change his name as my husband has changed mine. He would still hold the title Earl of Warwick, he would still answer to Edward Plantagenet, he would still be the true heir to the throne of England. When they raised his standard (and someone, sooner or later, was bound to raise his standard) half of England would turn out just for that haunting flicker of white embroidery, the white rose. That is what they call him: &#x201c;the White Rose.&#x201d;<br> <br>So since they could not take his name from him, they took his fortune and his lands. Then they took his liberty, packing him away like a forgotten banner, among other worthless things, into the Tower of London, among traitors and debtors and fools. But though he had no servants, no lands, no castle, no education, still my brother had his name, my name. Still Teddy had his title, my grandfather&#x2019;s title. Still he was Earl of Warwick, the White Rose, heir to the Plantagenet throne, a living constant reproach to the Tudors, who captured that throne and now call it their own. They took him into the darkness when he was a little boy of eleven and they did not bring him out until he was a man of twenty-four. He had not felt meadow grass under his feet for thirteen years. Then he walked out of the Tower, perhaps enjoying the smell of the rain on the wet earth, perhaps listening to the seagulls crying over the river, perhaps hearing beyond the high walls of the Tower the shouts and laughter of free men, free Englishmen, his subjects. With a guard on either side of him, he walked across the drawbridge and up to Tower Hill, knelt before the block, and put his head down as if he deserved to die, as if he were willing to die; and they beheaded him.<br> <br>That happened yesterday. Just yesterday. It rained all day. There was a tremendous storm, as if the sky was raging against cruelty, rain pouring down like grief, so that when they told me, as I stood beside my cousin the queen in her beautifully appointed rooms, we closed the shutters against the darkness as if we did not want to see the rain that on Tower Hill was washing blood into the gutter, my brother&#x2019;s blood, my blood, royal blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try to be brave,&#x201d; my husband murmurs again. &#x201c;Think of the baby. Try not to be afraid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not afraid.&#x201d; I twist my head to speak over my shoulder. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to try to be brave. I have nothing to fear. I know that I am safe with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He hesitates. He does not want to remind me that perhaps I do still have something to fear. Perhaps even his lowly estate is not humble enough to keep me safe. &#x201c;I meant, try not to show your grief . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; It comes out as a childish wail. &#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t I? Why shouldn&#x2019;t I grieve? My brother, my only brother, is dead! Beheaded like a traitor when he was innocent as a child. Why should I not grieve?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because they won&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; he says simply.<br> <br></p><h2>Visions of Vocation: Common Grace for the Common Good</h2><p><ul><li><em>Foreword Review's</em> 17th Annual INDIEFAB Book of the Year Finalist (Religion)</li><li>12th Annual <em>Outreach</em> Resource of the Year (Culture)</li><li>2015 <em>Christianity Today</em> Award of Merit (Christian Living)</li><li>2014 <em>Leadership Journal</em> Best Books for Church Leaders (The Leader's Outer Life)</li><li>2014 Book of the Year from Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Bookstore</li></ul> Is it possible to know the world and still love the world? Of all the questions we ask about our calling, this is the most difficult. From marriages to international relations, the more we know, the harder it is to love. We become cynics or stoics, protecting our hearts from the implications of what we know. But what if the vision of vocation can be recovered&#x2015;allowing us to step into the wounds of the world and for love?s sake take up our responsibility for the way the world turns out? For decades Steve Garber has come alongside a wide range of people as they seek to make sense of the world and their lives. With him we meet leaders from the Tiananmen Square protest who want a good reason to still care about China. We also meet with many ordinary people in ordinary places who long for their lives to matter: <ul><li>Jonathan who learned he would rather build houses than study history</li><li>Todd and Maria who adopted creative schedules so they could parent better and practice medicine </li><li>D.J. who helped Congress move into the Internet Age </li><li>Robin who spends her life on behalf of urban justice</li><li>Hans who makes hamburgers the way they are meant to be made</li><li>Susan who built a home business of hand-printing stationary using a letterpress </li><li>Santiago who works with majority-world nations in need of capital </li><li>George who has given years to teaching students to learn things that matter most</li><li>Claudius and Deirdre whose openhearted home has always been a place for people</li><li>Dan who loves Wyoming, the place, its people and its cows</li></ul> Vocation is when we come to know the world in all its joy and pain and still love it. Vocation is following our calling to seek the welfare of the world we live in. And in helping the world to flourish, strangely, mysteriously, we find that we flourish too. Garber offers a book for everyone everywhere&#x2015;for students, for parents, for those in the arts, in the academy, in public service, in the trades and in commerce&#x2015;for all who want to discover the virtue of vocation.</p><p>Steven Garber is professor of marketplace theology and leadership at Regent College, Vancouver, and the principal of The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation &amp; Culture. A consultant to foundations, corporations, and schools, he is a teacher of many people in many places. His books include <em>Visions of Vocation</em> and <em>The Fabric of Faithfulness,</em> and he is a contributor to the books <em>Faith Goes to Work: Reflections from the Marketplace</em> and <em>Get Up Off Your Knees: Preaching the U2 Catalogue.</em> He is married to Meg. They have five grown children and several grandchildren."Every generation wonders at its place in the world. Every adolescent agonizes over the 'purpose of my life.' But in such a time as ours&#x2015;with the world at our fingertips and seemingly endless opportunities to choose from&#x2015;such questions are particularly fraught. Into these questions of calling and vocation, Steven Garber steps with characteristic grace. Part prophet, part pastor and part teacher, Garber reminds the reader that to be alive on this earth is to be called&#x2015;to be implicated in the common good of your time and place. <em>Now that you know what you know, what will you do?</em> he asks. Garber helps Christians&#x2015;young and old&#x2015;press into their vocation as a response to the wounds and burdens of their particular context. This compelling and convicting book does not give easy answers but instead offers a robust definition of vocation to which Christians can cling no matter their age, location or circumstance." (Roxanne Stone, vice president of publishing at Barna Group, Outreach Magazine's Resources of the Year, March/April 2015)<br><br>"Many Christians struggle with envisioning what it is to be and to work in the world. Garber offers stories and wisdom that affirm the goodness and rightness of Christians pursuing callings in areas not traditionally considered ministry but that may be missional nonetheless." (Rachel Marie Stone, Christianity Today 2015 Book Awards, January/February 2015)<br><br>"<em>Visions of Vocation </em>will be considered a classic of our time, inspiring many to care more deeply and live out their own passions with vitality and integrity." (Byron Borger, Hearts Minds Bookstore, Dallastown, Pennsylvania)<br><br>"Garber fills in the fuzzy ideas about vocation and calling with stories of friends who have thoroughly and thoughtfully discerned how loving God's world plays out in real life. As a preacher I benefited from this vision of vocation that extends to every person in the pew." (David Swanson, Leadership Journal 2015 Book Awards, Winter 2015)<br><br>"American Christians regularly emphasize the roles of faith and piety in our personal interactions over the actions of care and love we can perform for the cities and towns in which we do our daily work. When Garber quotes Jeremiah 29:7, 'Seek the well-being of the city&#x2015;when it flourishes, you will flourish,' he advocates a position that will likely prove counter-cultural and unpopular&#x2015;and thought-worthy&#x2015;in such times of division as these." (Daniel de Roulet, The Covenant Companion, May 2014)<br><br>"Garber's breadth of knowledge, his ability to integrate ideas, and his beautiful and engaging writing make this book well worth reading, but his honesty and his concrete evidence of every person's ability to love the world and take responsibility for it hold the reader accountable. The book should come with a warning: You won't walk away unchanged." (Carolyn Dirksen, CCCU Advance, Fall 2014)<br><br>"<em>Visions of Vocation</em> asks the most compelling and human questions about how to love the world once you come to truly know it. These pages are packed with stories of wisdom and grace, serving as a vocational compass for anyone seeking true guidance in the midst of a complex world. I am grateful for the mentorship of Steve Garber's words, and I know you will be too." (Jena Lee Nardella, cofounder, Blood:Water Mission)<br><br>"If you have ever heard Garber speak in public, you know that he does so with a soothing, lyrical style that tips his audience to his fondness for music and poetry. He often notes that 'the artists get there first,' and his writing reflects this inclination, weaving in stories that begin as seemingly separate strands. Yet in Garber's chapters they are woven together to form a tapestry that reveals how vocation is integral to the mission of God. "This book is not for the faint of heart. Despite Garber's poetic style, his words pack a punch, challenging the reader to consider what it means to be 'implicated.'. . . Living with a full understanding of vocation means choosing to see the wounds of the world and responding with a heart of flesh rather than a heart of stone. It means choosing the better but not the easier. . . . "<em>Visions of Vocation</em> invites readers into what feels like a fireside chat with poets, musicians, and artists of all kinds on living a life of significance. It is a chat that feels preliminary but substantive; the kind of conversation you leave looking forward to the next one. . . . "If angst-filled young adults are looking for a formula to discern their future, it cannot be found in this book. Likewise, if theologians are looking for a systematic treatise on vocation, they too will soon be disappointed. However, what they will find is probably more valuable: a book that causes readers to think about their lives in new and challenging ways, exploring questions which, when answered in good conscience, comprise a fabric of faithfulness." (Drew Moser, Jess Fankhauser and Jeff Aupperle, Books Culture, September 2014)<br><br>"Steve Garber is one of the few consistent sources of wisdom that I rely on personally for my journey as an artist and as a Christ-follower. Like Magi's stars to the weary travelers in faith and culture, <em>Visions of Vocation</em> is a clear manifestation in the dark skies of our complex times that points to an integrated source of wisdom, delight and hope." (Makoto Fujimura, artist)<br><br>"Steve Garber has a way of making me feel spiritually rich. What he thinks and says is what I need. I realize this because he does both so well. His exceptional biblical insight and profound humanity increase my hunger for God and the ways of God. I am left seeking God?s calling into a more genuine human life and believing God intends this as part of the common good for which we are made and redeemed. Feast on this book and be fed."

Antonopoulos</h2><p>&#34;The Internet of Money Volume Two: a collection of talks&#34; is the spectacular sequel to the cult classic and best seller &#34;The Internet of Money Volume One: a collection of talks&#34; by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Volume Two contains 11 more of his most inspiring and thought-provoking talks, including: Introduction to Bitcoin; Blockchain vs Bullshit; Fake News, Fake Money; Currency Wars; Bubble Boy and the Sewer Rat; Rocket Science and Ethereum&#39;s Killer App; and many more. Volume Two also includes an all-new frequently asked questions section!In 2013, Andreas M. Antonopoulos started publicly speaking about bitcoin and quickly became one of the world&#39;s most sought-after speakers in the industry. To date, he has delivered more than 75, TED-style talks in venues ranging from the Henry Ford Museum in the United States to packed-out Bitcoin Meetups around the world including Brazil, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, and every talk is completely different.In these performances, Antonopoulos walks onto the stage and delivers a live, unscripted talk. Without a deck in sight, he unleashes his latest insights into the lightning-fast changes surrounding bitcoin. Combining the knowledge of one of the world&#39;s leading blockchain technologists, with cultural context, comedy, and the flair of a performance artist, Antonopoulos conveys an up-to-the-second understanding of bitcoin to live audiences worldwide.Many of these talks were so visionary, their content so educational, that they were curated and refined into a book form. On 7 September 2016, The Internet of Money Volume One was launched on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast (the interview has since been viewed more than 300,000 times). With its genesis in the lived, human experience, The Internet of Moneyoffered something that was desperately needed: an explanation of the philosophy, economics, politics, poetics, and technologies of bitcoin and open blockchains set within a broad historical context and using clear, simple language that delighted general audiences and bitcoin enthusiasts alike. During its first year, Volume One quickly became a hit in the global crypto-currency community-appealing to audiences from fields as diverse as the arts, sciences, and humanities. As one reader wrote: &#34;It provides a uniquely accessible take on a mind-bendingly abstract system.&#34; The Internet of Money Volume Two: a collection of talks builds on that momentum and offers readers an opportunity to experience more these inspiring and thought-provoking talks in print. It also includes a bonus question and answer section, where Andreas answers some of the most frequently asked questions from audience members during his worldwide tour. Volume Two is a sequel that rivals, even exceeds, the first, in content, scope, and vision. These talks are intellectual fire-starters you won&#39;t want to miss.

It's about the most common OAQs (obsessive anal questions): "This mole looks okay, doesn't it?" "Can Saltines go bad?" "They'll de-ice the wings before takeoff, right?" The Four Basic Shrugs. Acronyms never to use again: NASCAR, STD, and MRSA (<i>Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus</i>, the potentially deadly skin virus that&#x2019;s spread by contact, and also by talking about it casually). The things non-Jews do for fun and what Jews do: Contra dance/Contradict, Read the comics/Read the obituaries, Get your boobs done/Get your taxes done. Stuff never found in a Jewish home (trout flies, a lineoleum knife, a Lay-Z-Boy, a rottweiler) or mouth (Miracle Whip, marshmallow fluff, Bud).<br><br>So you'll sit, you'll read, you'll laugh until you're nauseous.

Worlds in Collision - written in a brilliant, easily understandable and entertaining style and full to the brim with precise information - can be considered one of the most important and most challenging books in the history of science. Not without reason was this book found open on Einstein's desk after his death. For all those who have ever wondered about the evolution of the earth, the history of mankind, traditions, religions, mythology or just the world as it is today, Worlds in Collision is an absolute MUST-READ!</p></p><p>Worlds in Collision is a special, an extraordinary book - not only by its contents, but also by the response it has received.<br> <p>It is one of the few scientific books of the past centuries that have a direct profound importance for humanity - individuals and society alike. In fact it is a book that puts our present view of the world on a whole new fundament - not in some abstract specialized disciplines remote from practical life, but in a broad range of areas like astronomy, cosmology, physics, geology, paleontology, biology, history, archaeology, literature, ethnology, theology, mythology, psychology; and in addition it has an important influence on the way man sees himself individually and socially.<br> </p><p>It is the first time in centuries that a scientist didn't choose the direct way to his specialized colleagues in order to make the results of his research known, but addressed himself to the general public in a simple and clear language and presentation - for which he was harshly punished by the scientific establishment.<br> </p><p>It is exactly this reaction from representatives of the "objective" sciences - that even match some medieval practices - which shows that this book deeply shakes the foundations of our knowledge - and belief. Because of this book being so special, it has deeply penetrated the consciousness of many people. Others however have preferred to forget it - or at least would like to do so. Due to this purposeful oblivion a younger generation doesn't even know about it any more, although today - almost 60 years after its first publication - it hasn't become less of a subject. On the contrary due to new results of scientific research and recent geological and climatic developments its importance has even increased. This, too, is something special in the flood of today's short-lived literary and scientific `flash in the pans'.<br> </p><p>It is important for everyone of us and for science at large to deal with this book. Therefore we are happy to take upon ourselves the responsible task of making the complete works of Immanuel Velikovsky - not just this book - available to the public again in its unchanged form. Publishing this book - and this unfortunately also is something special for non-fiction - has required a fair amount of courage, which we proudly and consciously muster up.</p>Worlds in Collision is a book of wars in the celestial sphere that took place in historical times. In these wars the planet earth participated too. This book describes two acts of a great drama: one that occurred thirty-four to thirty-five centuries ago, in the middle of the second millennium before the present era; the other in the eighth and the beginning of the seventh century before the present era, twenty-six centuries ago. Accordingly this volume consists of two parts, preceded by a prologue.<br> <p>Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres is the point of departure of the present-day concept of the world as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the theory of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are sacrosanct, this book is a heresy. However, modern physics, of atoms and of the quantum theory, describes dramatic changes in the microcosm - the atom - the prototype of the solar system; a theory, then, that envisages not dissimilar events in the macrocosm - the solar system - brings the modern concepts of physics to the celestial sphere.<br> </p><p>This book is written for the instructed and uninstructed alike. No formula and no hieroglyphic will stand in the way of those who set out to read it. If, occasionally, historical evidence does not square with formulated laws, it should be remembered that a law is but a deduction from experience and experiment, and therefore laws must conform with historical facts, not facts with laws.<br> </p><p>The reader is not asked to accept a theory without question. Rather, he is invited to consider for himself whether he is reading a book of fiction or non-fiction, whether what he is reading is invention or historical fact. On one point alone, not necessarily decisive for the theory of cosmic catastrophism, I borrow credence: I use a synchronical scale of Egyptian and Hebrew histories which is not orthodox.</p></p><h2>Tom Clancy Duty and Honor (A Jack Ryan Jr. Novel)</h2><p><b>Jack Ryan Jr. is caught in the cross-hairs of a would-be tyrant in this exhilarating thriller in Tom Clancy's&nbsp;#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br><br>Jack Ryan, Jr., is on his own. He's been ousted from his position at the Campus, the off-the-books intelligence agency that was set up by his father, the President. As if that's not bad enough, someone is out for Jack&#x2018;s blood. The police think that he was just the victim of a mugging, but he knows a professional assassin when he kills one.&nbsp;<br><br>Using clues found on his would-be dispatcher, Jack launches his own shadow campaign to uncover the brutal truth about a world-renowned philanthropist and human rights advocate&#x2014;and a long-running false-flag war of terror that has claimed thousands of lives....</p><p>A little more than thirty years ago <b>Tom Clancy </b>was a Maryland insurance broker with a passion for naval history. Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore&#x2019;s Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>&#x2014;the first of the phenomenally successful Jack Ryan novels&#x2014;sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it &#x201c;the perfect yarn.&#x201d; From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.<br><br><b>Grant Blackwood</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Briggs Tanner series (<i>End of Enemies</i>, <i>Wall of Night</i>, and <i>Echo of War</i>). He is coauthor of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Dead or Alive</i>, with Tom Clancy, and of the thriller <i>The Kill Switch</i>, with James Rollins. A U.S. Navy veteran, Grant spent three years aboard a guided missile frigate as an Operations Specialist and a Pilot Rescue Swimmer. He lives in Arizona, where he is working on his own stand-alone series starring a new hero.<p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alexandria, Virginia</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack Ryan, Jr., would later wonder what exactly had saved his life that night. One thing was certain: It hadn&#x2019;t been skill. Maybe the heft of the bok choy had bought him a split second, maybe the mud, but not skill. Dumb luck. Survival instinct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Supermercado was neither in his neighborhood nor near his frequent errand stops, but it did have the best selection of fruits and vegetables in Alexandria&#x2014;�so Ding Chavez had told him eight months ago&#x2014;�yet it had been only recently, since his forced leave of absence from The Campus, that he&#x2019;d become a believer. Being unemployed had given him a lot to think about and plenty of time to broaden his horizons. The one frontier he&#x2019;d so far refused to explore despite his sister Sally&#x2019;s exhortations was binge-�watching <i>Girls</i> on HBO. That was his Rubicon. No crossing the river for the Roman legions, no chick TV for Jack Ryan. Soon, though, he&#x2019;d have to make a decision about his loose-�ends lifestyle. Another couple weeks and his probation would be over. Gerry Hendley would want an answer: Was he coming back to The Campus, or were they parting company permanently?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>And do what? </i>Jack thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;d spent most of his adult life working at The Campus, aka Hendley Associates, first as an analyst and then as an operations officer&#x2014;�a field spook. The off-�the-�books counterterror organization had been created by his father, President Jack Ryan, and had, since its inception, been overseen by former senator Gerry Hendley. So far they&#x2019;d had a lot of success going after some of the world&#x2019;s &#x201c;big bads&#x201d; while still managing to make a decent profit not just for their clients, all of whom knew Hendley only as a financial arbitrage company, but also for The Campus&#x2019;s covert operational budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Seventeen fifty,&#x201d; the cashier told him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack handed her a twenty, took his change, then collected his brown-�paper sack from the glum teenage bagger and headed for the door. It was just past eight p.m. and the store was almost deserted. Through the broad front windows he could see rain glittering in the glow of the parking lot&#x2019;s sodium-�vapor lights. Accompanied by a cold front, rain had been falling in Alexandria for three straight days. Creeks were swollen and the DIY stores nearest the Potomac were seeing a jump in sandbag sales. Perfect weather for homemade slow-�cooker chili. He&#x2019;d just put in a solid eight miles on his gym&#x2019;s indoor track, followed by a twenty-�minute �circuit of push-�ups, pull-�ups, and planks, and he hoped to turn his bag full of ground beef, beans, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and bok choy&#x2014;�his mom&#x2019;s most recent superfood recommendation&#x2014;�into a reward for all his sweat. The chili wouldn&#x2019;t be ready until tomorrow; tonight, Chinese-�takeout leftovers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The automatic door slid open and Jack used his free hand to pull his sweatshirt&#x2019;s hood over his head. It was a short walk to his car&#x2014;�a black Chrysler 300 and the first sedan he&#x2019;d owned in a long time&#x2014;�and then a fifteen-�minute drive back to his condo at the Oronoco. The parking lot&#x2019;s surface was new and its fresh coat of asphalt shimmered black under the slick of rain. Moving at a half-�jog, feeling the chilled rain running down his chin and into his shirt, Jack covered the thirty yards to his car, which he&#x2019;d parked trunk-�first against the guardrail. Old habits, he thought. Be ready to leave quickly; know your closest exits and highways. Months of &#x201c;civilian&#x201d; life and still a lot of the fieldcraft rules John Clark and the rest had taught him hadn&#x2019;t faded. Did this tell Jack something? Was this just a shadow of a habit, or inclination?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he neared his car, he saw a sheet of white paper stuck under his windshield wiper. A flyer&#x2014;�food drive, garage sale, voting reminder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whatever it was, Jack wasn&#x2019;t in the mood. He leaned sideways and reached for the flyer. Sodden, it tore free in a clump, leaving a narrow strip trapped beneath the wiper blade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Jack muttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From behind, a voice: &#x201c;Hey, man, give it up!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even before he turned, the tone of the man&#x2019;s voice combined with the time of night and location had touched off Jack&#x2019;s warning bells. The Supermercado wasn&#x2019;t in the best of neighborhoods, with its fair share of crack-�driven homelessness and petty crime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack turned on his heel while taking two steps backward, hoping to buy time and room to maneuver. The man was tall, nearly six and a half feet, and gangly, his head covered in a dark hood, and he came from Jack&#x2019;s left at a fast walking pace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overhead, lightning flashed, casting the man&#x2019;s face in stark shadow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Break his pattern,</i> Jack thought. Having targeted his prey and committed himself to the attack, the man&#x2014;�a crackhead or tweaker, Jack guessed&#x2014;�was laser focused, confident this roll would go like all the others. Jack needed to change that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took a step toward the man and pointed. &#x201c;Fuck off! Go away!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Junkie muggers rarely saw this kind of victim aggression. Wolves prefer weak sheep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Jack&#x2019;s belligerence had no effect. The man&#x2019;s pace and his locked-�on gaze at Jack didn&#x2019;t waver. His right hand, hanging beside his thigh, rose up to his waist, palm away from Jack. <i>He&#x2019;s got a knife.</i> If his attacker was carrying a gun he would have already brandished it. With a gun you could put the fear of God in someone at a distance; with a knife you needed to get close enough to put the blade against your victim&#x2019;s face or neck. And the palm-�away knife grip told Jack something else: The man wasn&#x2019;t interested in scaring him into submission. It was easier to strip valuables from a dead body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack&#x2019;s heart was pounding now, his breathing going shallow. He swept his right hand to his hip, lifted the hem of his sweatshirt with his thumb, his palm touching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing. <i>God damn it.</i> He wasn&#x2019;t armed; he had a CCW permit but had stopped carrying his Glock the day he left The Campus. <i>Keys.</i> His car keys were in his pocket, not where they should have been&#x2014;�in his hand, as a backup weapon. <i>Lazy, Jack.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His attacker hadn&#x2019;t missed seeing Jack&#x2019;s flash of hesitation. He sprinted forward, right hand sweeping up and out in preparation for a cross-�hand neck slash. As though passing a basketball, Jack heaved his grocery bag at the man. It bounced off his chest, the contents scattering across the wet asphalt. This broke both his pattern and his stride, but for only a moment, and did not leave enough time to create an opening for Jack&#x2019;s own attack. <i>Retreat, then. Live to fight another day.</i> There was no point getting in a knife fight if he had a choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He turned, sprinted for the guardrail, vaulted it, and landed in mush. Below him, a slope with patchy grass and cedar ground cover met a line of concrete Jersey barrier along the highway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behind him, Jack vaguely registered the man&#x2019;s footsteps picking up speed on the pavement. He started shuffle-�sliding down the embankment, using the scrub brush for footholds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His attacker was fast. A hand clutched Jack&#x2019;s hood and wrenched his head backward, exposing his throat. Jack didn&#x2019;t fight it, but rather spun hard to his right, into the man and toward what he guessed would be the descending knife blade. And it was there, arcing toward his face. Jack lifted his left arm and drove his forearm down, diverting the blade and trapping the man&#x2019;s arm in his own armpit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With his right hand Jack reached up, fingers clawing at the man&#x2019;s eyes and pushing his head sideways. Together they fell back, Jack on top. They began sliding down, churning up mud and grinding over cedar stumps as they went.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man was flailing, but with purpose, Jack realized. Trying to free his knife arm from Jack&#x2019;s armpit, the man reached across with his left hand, grabbed Jack&#x2019;s chin, and wrenched his head sideways. Pain flashed in Jack&#x2019;s neck. One of the man&#x2019;s fingers slipped into his mouth, and Jack bit down hard, heard a muffled crunch. The man screamed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still entwined, they slammed to a stop against one of the Jersey barriers bordering the highway. Jack heard a sick-�sounding thud, followed by an <i>umph</i>. Through squinted eyes Jack saw the flash of headlights, heard the hiss of tires on the wet pavement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man was rolling sideways, crawling on his hands and knees. Lightning flashed again and Jack could make out a bloody divot in the side of his skull; a flap of scalp drooped over his ear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Skull fracture</i>. A bad one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack was crawling also, but in the opposite direction, toward the embankment. He got to his feet and turned. The man was already up and lumbering toward him. Like a drunk trying to walk a line, the man crossed his feet and staggered, gathering momentum until he plunged face-�first into the mud. Swaying, he pushed himself to his knees. He reached up to touch the side of his skull, then stared at his bloody hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d; the man growled, his speech slurred. &#x201c;I need a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. need the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He scanned the ground as though he&#x2019;d lost something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Looking for his knife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack spotted it a few feet to the man&#x2019;s left front. Too late. The man pushed himself to his feet and shuffled toward it. Jack charged, feet slipping in the mud as he tried to close the distance. The man bent over for the knife, almost tipping forward as he did so. Jack pushed off with his back foot, drove his knee upward. It slammed into the man&#x2019;s face, vaulting him backward into the barricade. Jack&#x2019;s feet slipped out from under him and he toppled backward into the mud. His head bounced against the ground. His vision sparkled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Move&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do something,</i> he thought. <i>He&#x2019;s coming.</i> An image of himself flashed in his mind&#x2014;�flat on his back in the mud, throat slashed open, rain peppering his open eyes, the flash of a coroner&#x2019;s camera&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>No, no way.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Jack rolled onto his side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten feet away his attacker sat half sprawled against the concrete barricade. His head lolled to one side. The gray concrete behind him was smeared with blood. The man was white, pale, in his mid-�thirties, with close-�cropped light hair. Jack glimpsed what looked like white skull through his lacerated scalp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay there, man!&#x201d; Jack shouted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blinking as though confused, the man focused on Jack for a second, then rolled sideways and began working with his knees like a toddler trying to crawl on a tile floor. He managed to climb to his feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tough son of a bitch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack spotted the glint of the knife a few feet away, half buried in the muck. He crawled to it, grabbed it. It was a locking folder, almost eight inches long, and hefty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Just stop!&#x201d; Jack shouted, panting. He tasted blood in his mouth. He spit it out. His, or the mugger&#x2019;s? he wondered. &#x201c;The cops are coming!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He doubted this, but maybe it would be enough to either drive the man off or make him sit back down and accept his fate. And a free trip to the ER. Chances were, in the darkness and the rain, no one knew what was happening, didn&#x2019;t know that Jack Ryan, Jr., America&#x2019;s First Son and unemployed special operator, was fighting for his life with a crackhead mugger in the mud beside a highway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Christ Almighty</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man was moving now, but not toward Jack. With his left hand braced against the top of the concrete barricade, he shuffled forward, stopped, kept going. A car swept past him, honking, covering him in a sheet of water. The man didn&#x2019;t react.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Brain injury, </i>Jack thought. Despite himself, he felt a pang of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what?

Humans have feared them for centuries, long considering them the assassins and pariahs of the natural world.</p><p>Now, in <i>Venomous</i>, the biologist Christie Wilcox investigates and illuminates the animals of our nightmares, arguing that they hold the keys to a deeper understanding of evolution, adaptation, and immunity. She reveals just how venoms function and what they do to the human body. With Wilcox as our guide, we encounter a jellyfish with tentacles covered in stinging cells that can kill humans in minutes; a two-inch caterpillar with toxic bristles that trigger hemorrhaging; and a stunning blue-ringed octopus capable of inducing total paralysis. How do these animals go about their deadly work? How did they develop such intricate, potent toxins? Wilcox takes us around the world and down to the cellular level to find out. </p><p>Throughout her journey, Wilcox meets the intrepid scientists who risk their lives studying these lethal beasts, as well as &#x201c;self-immunizers&#x201d; who deliberately expose themselves to snakebites. Along the way, she puts her own life on the line, narrowly avoiding being envenomated herself. Drawing on her own research, Wilcox explains how venom scientists are untangling the mechanisms of some of our most devastating diseases, and reports on pharmacologists who are already exploiting venoms to produce lifesaving drugs. We discover that venomous creatures are in fact keystone species that play crucial roles in their ecosystems and ours&#x2015;and for this alone, they ought to be protected and appreciated.</p><p>Thrilling and surprising at every turn, <i>Venomous</i> will change everything you thought you knew about the planet&#x2019;s most dangerous animals.</p></p><p><b>Christie Wilcox, </b><b>PhD, </b>is a scientist and an award-winning science writer.

Here are canning recipes from the famed encyclopedia along with detailed explanations of the processes behind canning and preserving, and a wealth of recipes for fruits, vegetables, meats and fish, and herbs. From drying to pickling to freezing, Emery's preserving methods are as broad in scope as the recipes themselves. Do-it-yourselfers can welcome summer's arrival with Chunky Peach Jam and Oven-Dried Tomatoes, or host a fall harvest with fresh Herb Bouquets and Smoked Chicken. Step-by-step instructions, illustrations, charts, and informational sidebars make the process easy and enjoyable.</p><p>Carla Emery passed away in 2005. Lorene Edwards Forkner is a freelance writer and award-winning garden designer. The coauthor of Hortus Miscellaneous, she lives in Seattle.In this collection, excerpted from Emery's seminal Encyclopedia of Country Living, home cooks get a wealth of practical ideas and techniques for making the most of fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and meats come harvest season. Emery's plainspoken approach to pickling, canning, drying and freezing removes much of the worry; tips on labeling, prepping vegetables for the freezer and a thorough introduction to canning (complete with processing times) will give first-timers confidence and make a welcome refresher for veterans. The recipes lean heavily on timeworn favorites like jams (including a No-Cook Strawberry Jam), sauerkraut, pickles, basic beef jerky and corned beef, though duck confit and the prospect of creating one's own buried storage system should appeal to foodies ready for a new challenge. Sprinkled with tips on infusing liquors and recipes for the impatient like Quick Pickles (which reach their flavor potential in hours, rather than weeks) round out this fine introduction; it should have, like its subject matter, quite an extended shelf life. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Based on a close analysis of the manuscript, thoroughly annotated, and packaged with a history of the text and perspectives for its criticism, this edition will remain the definitive version of a profoundly suggestive story.<br><br>"The texts are impeccably accurate. . . . The collection is accompanied by an unobtrusive but expert annotation. . . . Probably Melville's finest short work, the incomplete 'Billy Budd,' [is] a striking reworking of the crucifixion set in the English maritime service of the Revolutionary period."&#x2014;John Sutherland, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p><b>Herman Melville</b> was born in 1819 in New York City. After his father's death he left school for a series of clerical jobs before going to sea as a young man of nineteen. At twenty-one he shipped aboard the whaler <i>Acushnet</i> and began a series of adventures in the South Seas that would last for three years and form the basis for his first two novels, <i>Typee</i> and <i>Omoo.</i> Although these two novels sold well and gained for Melville a measure of fame, nineteenth-century readers were puzzled by the experiments with form that he began with his third novel, <i>Mardi,</i> and continued brilliantly in his masterpiece, <i>Moby-Dick.</i> During his later years spent working as a customs inspector on the New York docks, Melville published only poems, compiled in a collection entitled <i>Battle-Pieces,</i> and died in 1891 with <i>Billy Budd, Sailor,</i> now considered a classic, still unpublished.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> In the time before steamships, or then more frequently than now, a stroller along the docks of any considerable seaport would occasionally have his attention arrested by a group of bronzed mariners, man-of-war's men or merchant sailors in holiday attire, ashore on liberty. In certain instances they would flank, or like a bodyguard quite surround, some superior figure of their own class, moving along with them like Aldebaran among the lesser lights of his constellation. That signal object was the "Handsome Sailor" of the less prosaic time alike of the military and merchant navies. With no perceptible trace of the vainglorious about him, rather with the offhand unaffectedness of natural regality, he seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his shipmates. </p><p> A somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me. In Liverpool, now half a century ago, I saw under the shadow of the great dingy street-wall of Prince's Dock (an obstruction long since removed) a common sailor so intensely black that he must needs have been a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham -- a symmetric figure much above the average height. The two ends of a gay silk handkerchief thrown loose about the neck danced upon the displayed ebony of his chest, in his ears were big hoops of gold, and a Highland bonnet with a tartan band set off his shapely head. It was a hot noon in July; and his face, lustrous with perspiration, beamed with barbaric good humor. In jovial sallies right and left, his white teeth flashing into view, he rollicked along, the center of a company of his shipmates. These were made up of such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots before the bar of the first French Assembly as Representatives of the Human Race. At each spontaneous tribute rendered by the wayfarers to this black pagod of a fellow -- the tribute of a pause and stare, and less frequently an exclamation -- the motley retinue showed that they took that sort of pride in the evoker of it which the Assyrian priests doubtless showed for their grand sculptured Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves. </p><p> To return. If in some cases a bit of a nautical Murat in setting forth his person ashore, the Handsome Sailor of the period in question evinced nothing of the dandified Billy-be-Dam, an amusing character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered, and in a form yet more amusing than the original, at the tiller of the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing in the groggeries along the towpath. Invariably a proficient in his perilous calling, he was also more or less of a mighty boxer or wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were recited. Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on every suitable occasion always foremost. Close-reefing topsails in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yardarm-end, foot in the Flemish horse as stirrup, both hands tugging at the earing as at a bridle, in very much the attitude of young Alexander curbing the fiery Bucephalus. A superb figure, tossed up as by the horns of Taurus against the thunderous sky, cheerily hallooing, to the strenuous file along the spar. </p><p> The moral nature was seldom out of keeping with the physical make. Indeed, except as toned by the former, the comeliness and power, always attractive in masculine conjunction, hardly could have drawn the sort of honest homage the Handsome Sailor in some examples received from his less gifted associates. </p><p> Such a cynosure, at least in aspect, and something such too in nature, though with important variations made apparent as the story proceeds, was welkin-eyed Billy Budd -- or Baby Budd, as more familiarly, under circumstances hereafter to be given, he at last came to be called -- aged twenty-one, a foretopman of the British fleet toward the close of the last decade of the eighteenth century. It was not very long prior to the time of the narration that follows that he had entered the King's service, having been impressed on the Narrow Seas from a homeward-bound English merchantman into a seventy-four outward bound, H.M.S. <i>Bellipotent;</i> which ship, as was not unusual in those hurried days, having been obliged to put to sea short of her proper complement of men. Plump upon Billy at first sight in the gangway the boarding officer, Lieutenant Ratcliffe, pounced, even before the merchantman's crew was formally mustered on the quarter-deck for his deliberate inspection. And him only he elected. For whether it was because the other men when ranged before him showed to ill advantage after Billy, or whether he had some scruples in view of the merchantman's being rather short-handed, however it might be, the officer contented himself with his first spontaneous choice. To the surprise of the ship's company, though much to the lieutenant's satisfaction, Billy made no demur. But, indeed, any demur would have been as idle as the protest of a goldfinch popped into a cage. </p><p> Noting this uncomplaining acquiescence, all but cheerful, one might say, the shipmaster turned a surprised glance of silent reproach at the sailor. The shipmaster was one of those worthy mortals found in every vocation, even the humbler ones -- the sort of person whom everybody agrees in calling "a respectable man." And -- nor so strange to report as it may appear to be -- though a ploughman of the troubled waters, lifelong contending with the intractable elements, there was nothing this honest soul at heart loved better than simple peace and quiet. For the rest, he was fifty or thereabouts, a little inclined to corpulence, a prepossessing face, unwhiskered, and of an agreeable color -- a rather full face, humanely intelligent in expression. On a fair day with a fair wind and all going well, a certain musical chime in his voice seemed to be the veritable unobstructed outcome of the innermost man. He had much prudence, much conscientiousness, and there were occasions when these virtues were the cause of overmuch disquietude in him. On a passage, so long as his craft was in any proximity to land, no sleep for Captain Graveling. He took to heart those serious responsibilities not so heavily borne by some shipmasters. </p><p> Now while Billy Budd was down in the forecastle getting his kit together, the <i>Bellipotent's</i> lieutenant, burly and bluff, nowise disconcerted by Captain Graveling's omitting to proffer the customary hospitalities on an occasion so unwelcome to him, an omission simply caused by preoccupation of thought, unceremoniously invited himself into the cabin, and also to a flask from the spirit locker, a receptacle which his experienced eye instantly discovered. In fact he was one of those sea dogs in whom all the hardship and peril of naval life in the great prolonged wars of his time never impaired the natural instinct for sensuous enjoyment. His duty he always faithfully did; but duty is sometimes a dry obligation, and he was for irrigating its aridity, whensoever possible, with a fertilizing decoction of strong waters. For the cabin's proprietor there was nothing left but to play the part of the enforced host with whatever grace and alacrity were practicable. As necessary adjuncts to the flask, he silently placed tumbler and water jug before the irrepressible guest. But excusing himself from partaking just then, he dismally watched the unembarrassed officer deliberately diluting his grog a little, then tossing it off in three swallows, pushing the empty tumbler away, yet not so far as to be beyond easy reach, at the same time settling himself in his seat and smacking his lips with high satisfaction, looking straight at the host. </p><p> These proceedings over, the master broke the silence; and there lurked a rueful reproach in the tone of his voice: "Lieutenant, you are going to take my best man from me, the jewel of 'em." </p><p> "Yes, I know," rejoined the other, immediately drawing back the tumbler preliminary to a replenishing. "Yes, I know. Sorry." </p><p> "Beg pardon, but you don't understand, Lieutenant. See here, now. Before I shipped that young fellow, my forecastle was a rat-pit of quarrels. It was black times, I tell you, aboard the <i>Rights</i> here. I was worried to that degree my pipe had no comfort for me. But Billy came; and it was like a Catholic priest striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he preached to them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue went out of him, sugaring the sour ones. They took to him like hornets to treacle; all but the buffer of the gang, the big shaggy chap with the fire-red whiskers. He indeed, out of envy, perhaps, of the newcomer, and thinking such a "sweet and pleasant fellow," as he mockingly designated him to the others, could hardly have the spirit of a gamecock, must needs bestir himself in trying to get up an ugly row with him. Billy forebore with him and reasoned with him in a pleasant way -- he is something like myself, Lieutenant, to whom aught like a quarrel is hateful -- but nothing served. So, in the second dogwatch one day, the Red Whiskers in presence of the others, under pretense of showing Billy just whence a sirloin steak was cut -- for the fellow had once been a butcher -- insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs. Quick as lightning Billy let fly his arm. I dare say he never meant to do quite as much as he did, but anyhow he gave the burly fool a terrible drubbing. It took about half a minute, I should think. And, lord bless you, the lubber was astonished at the celerity. And will you believe it, Lieutenant, the Red Whiskers now really loves Billy -- loves him, or is the biggest hypocrite that ever I heard of. But they all love him. Some of 'em do his washing, darn his old trousers for him; the carpenter is at odd times making a pretty little chest of drawers for him. Anybody will do anything for Billy Budd; and it's the happy family here. But now, Lieutenant, if that young fellow goes -- I know how it will be aboard the <i>Rights.</i> Not again very soon shall I, coming up from dinner, lean over the capstan smoking a quiet pipe -- no, not very soon again, I think. Ay, Lieutenant...</p></p><h2>College Algebra (6th Edition)</h2><p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; Access Code is NOT INCLUDED<br><br>Bob Blitzer has inspired thousands of students</strong> with his engaging approach to mathematics, making this beloved series the #1 in the market.

Such was the case for Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle, scientists who frequently collaborate on book and museum exhibition projects. When the conversation turned to wine one evening, it almost inevitably led the two&#x2014;one a palaeoanthropologist, the other a molecular biologist&#x2014;to begin exploring the many intersections between science and wine. This book presents their fascinating, freewheeling answers to the question &#x201c;What can science tell us about wine?&#x201d; And vice versa.<br> &nbsp;<br> Conversational and accessible to everyone, this colorfully illustrated book embraces almost every imaginable area of the sciences, from microbiology and ecology (for an understanding of what creates this complex beverage) to physiology and neurobiology (for insight into the effects of wine on the mind and body). The authors draw on physics, chemistry, biochemistry, evolution, and climatology, and they expand the discussion to include insights from anthropology, primatology, entomology, Neolithic archaeology, and even classical history. The resulting volume is indispensible for anyone who wishes to appreciate wine to its fullest.</p><p>What inspired you to investigate the natural history of wine?<br> &nbsp;<br> We were inspired to do this book when we found ourselves drinking wine as an inspirational aid while writing our last book together, on the evolution of the brain. It occurred to us that wine is a wonderful perspective through which to view almost every area of natural science.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why are humans so enamored of wine?<br><br> There are plenty of evolutionary scenarios to explain both our ability to metabolize alcohol and our propensity to seek it out. Quite honestly, though, wine itself transcends purely reductionist explanations. It appeals comprehensively to our senses, but it is much more than simply a sensory stimulus.&nbsp;It is a wonderful metaphor for some fundamental aspects of human experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> Do you have a &#x201c;favorite fact&#x201d; about any particular wine or vintage?<br><br> This book is about wine itself, rather than about particular wines, or styles of wine. However, a particular favorite is the &#x201c;Prephylloxera&#x201d; bottling from Mount Etna, made from ancient gnarled vines that somehow survived the epidemic that almost destroyed the wine industry in the late nineteenth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where is wine going?<br><br> The chemistry of wine won&#x2019;t change in the future, and more than likely the genetics of wine won&#x2019;t either. But as an extension of the human spirit, wine will continue to challenge human creativity in exactly the same way it first did seven or eight thousand years ago.<b>Ian Tattersall</b> is curator emeritus in the Division of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), New York City. <b>Rob DeSalle</b> is curator of entomology in the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, AMNH.</p><h2>Rachel &amp; Leah - Bible Study Book: What Two Sisters Teach Us about Combating Comparison</h2><p><i>Why her?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> How many times have you asked yourself that question?

Each book includes discussion questions that help clarify and reinforce major themes and reading recommendations for further research.<br> <br>Read with confidence.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

In the garden, everyone from the village has gathered to present the annual pageant--scenes from the history of England, beginning with the Elizabethan Age and ending with "ourselves," the audience. As the story unfolds, the lives of the villagers also take shape. We learn of the strained relationship between Isa Oliver and her husband, Giles, discontented stockbroker and son of Bart Oliver, the owner of Pointz Hall. When<b> </b>a storm rushes in and hastens the completion of the play, the performers and the audience take their leave, and Giles and Isa are finally left alone.

If there is any consensus, it is in the idea that the sublime represents a testing of limits to the point at which fixities begin to fragment. This anthology examines how contemporary artists and theorists explore ideas of the sublime, in relation to the unpresentable, transcendence, terror, nature, technology, the uncanny, and altered states. Providing a philosophical and cultural context for discourse around the sublime in recent art, the book surveys the diverse and sometimes conflicting interpretations of the term as it has evolved from the writings of Longinus, Burke, and Kant to present-day writers and artists. The sublime underlies the nobility of Classicism, the awe of Romantic nature, and the terror of the Gothic. In the last half-century, the sublime has haunted postwar abstraction, returned from the repression of theoretical formalism, and has become a key term in critical discussions of human otherness and posthuman realms of nature and technology.</p><p><b>Artists surveyed include <br></b>Marina Abramovic[, Joseph Beuys, Tacita Dean, Walter De Maria, A K Dolven, Olafur Eliasson, Andreas Gursky, Jitka Hanzlov�, Gary Hill, Susan Hiller, Shirazeh Houshiary, Anish Kapoor, Mike Kelley, Anselm Kiefer, Yves Klein, Richard Long, Barnett Newman, Tony Oursler, Cornelia Parker, Gerhard Richter, Doris Salcedo, Lorna Simpson, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Fred Tomaselli, James Turrell, Luc Tuymans, Bill Viola, Zhang HuanWriters include Marco Belpoliti, John Berger, Paul Crowther, Jacques Derrida, Okwui Enwezor, Jean Fisher, Barbara Claire Freeman, Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, Doreet LeVitte-Harten, Eleanor Hartney, Lynn M.

Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Emily Bront�, Thomas Hardy and Edgar Allen Poe responded. In the twentieth century, two world wars and the two atomic bombs must have had something to do with the sublime pathos of Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Francis Bacon and the poetry of Wallace Stevens. In this anthology, Simon Morley looks to the twenty-first century, to our sublime.

The contributors show us that the world can still be transformed. Many of these works and texts perform the contemporary sublime. They open a schism between expectation and sensation, expanding the horizon between the known territories of the real and our capacity to imagine otherwise. They show us that we may still be taken by surprise by scenes of wonder. Aesthetic experience at the brink of our senses removes the familiar ground on which we know and experience the existential condition of being.</p>&#x2015;<b>Johanna Drucker</b>, Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies, University of California at Los Angeles</p><h2>Dream of Reason: A History of Western Philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance</h2><p><p><strong>"His book...supplant[s] all others, even the immensely successful <em>History of Western Philosophy</em> by Bertrand Russell."&#x2015;A.

For all who have been on this journey, searching for a deeper, more transformative life with God and a new kind of Christianity, The Last Word can mark the beginning of an exciting spiritual adventure into new ways of believing, belonging, and becoming.</p></p><h2>The Everything Kids&#39; Learning Spanish Book: Exercises and puzzles to help you learn Espanol</h2><p><i>Hola, amigos!</i><br><br>Learning <i>espanol</i> is a blast with this book.

Until the mid-twentieth century even the most partisan of Melville&#x2019;s advocates hesitated to endure a four-part poem of 150 cantos and almost 18,000 lines about a naive American named Clarel, on pilgrimage through the Palestinian ruins with a provocative cluster of companions. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But modern critics have found <i>Clarel</i> a much better poem than was ever realized.

Most strikingly, it is argued that the character Vine is a portrait of Melville&#x2019;s friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. <i>Clarel </i>is one of the most complex theological explorations of faith and doubt in all of American literature, and this edition brings Melville&#x2019;s poem to new life.</p></p><p>The aim of this edition of Clarel, volume twelve in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of The Writing of Herman Melville, is to present a text as close to the authors intention as surviving evidence permits.

It was, it is, and it always will be the game of the geeks, but its fandom is no longer so neatly contained. Once an esoteric diversion known only to a small but passionate group of wargamers, the game and the foundational concepts that it brought forth became among the most influential phenomena of the Information Age. The reason? The game&#x2019;s earliest adopters happened to share an interest in other &#x201c;geeky&#x201d; things like computers, electronics, digital technologies, visual effects, filmmaking, performing arts, and beyond. These geeks grew up to develop the social and business infrastructure of the twenty-first century using concepts they had once learned on poorly lit tabletops set in dining rooms and basements. Dungeons &amp; Dragons, according to <i>Wired </i>editor Adam Rogers, &#x201c;allowed geeks to venture out of our dungeons, blinking against the light, just in time to create the present age of electronic miracles.&#x201d; It is indeed chic to be geek, and the prophesy has finally been fulfilled: the geek shall inherit the Earth (and the parallel D&amp;D world of Oerth).<br><br>Today, if you are one of the millions of subscribers to an MMO (massively multiplayer online game)such as <i>World of Warcraft</i>; a tourist in the exotic worlds of a computer role-playing franchise such as <i>Final Fantasy </i>or <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>; a virtual marksman in any first-person-shooter video game; a lover of modern fantasy television, films, or literature such as <i>Game of Thrones</i>; or even anyone who has ever &#x201c;leveled up&#x201d; in a game or rewards program, then you have Dungeons &amp; Dragons to thank. Simply put, D&amp;D has either directly or indirectly influenced them all. John Romero, co-creatorof the seminal first-person-shooter <i>Doom</i>, attributes his success to D&amp;D, calling it &#x201c;the most influential game,&#x201d; adding that &#x201c;the gaming concepts put forth by D&amp;D inspired the earliest groups of gamers and computer programmers, and set into motion a revolution of creative and technical innovation.&#x201d; The numbers of actors and directors who credit the game with providing them inspiration is immense, from Vin Diesel and Stephen Colbert to Rainn Wilson and the late Robin Williams. Celebrated director Jon Favreau suggested the game gave him &#x201c;a really strong background in imagination, storytelling,understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance.&#x201d; National Book Award&#x2013;winner Ta-Nehisi Coates agrees, suggesting the game helped introduce him to &#x201c;the powers of imagination.&#x201d; All this is to say, the story of D&amp;D is as important now as it has ever been, and with the recent success of 5th edition and an array of D&amp;D-inspired blockbuster books, shows, and films surfacing, from <i>Ready Player One</i> to <i>Stranger Things</i>, its history will become increasingly visible and relevant.<br><br>Nothing conveys the story of D&amp;D better than its visuals. At a time when fantasy and science fiction were, at best, fringe diversions, D&amp;D was creating a culture of do-it-yourself fantasy&nbsp;world-building through its immersive narrative environments, given life by its ever-evolving illustrations and artwork. It depicted monsters, magic, swords, and sorcery in a way that taught fans a visual vocabulary of the unreal, fixing in the minds of a whole generation how to picture the fantastic. The relationship between Dungeons &amp; Dragons and its artwork goes beyond symbiosis, but to outright reliance&#x2014;one simply couldn&#x2019;t exist without the other. The art informed the game, and the game informed the art. Beginning as amateur, homebrew sketches used to illustrate to the initiated simple concepts such as maps and the physical appearance of monsters, characters, and weapons, the art of D&amp;D rapidly became an essential teaching tool as the game reached wider audiences less familiar with some of its fundamental concepts. The illustrations quickly had to become instructional in nature, helping players to not only conceptualize the landscapes, inhabitants, and equipment of the imagined world, but even how to use them in the context of the game. Soon the game and its fandom demanded even greater levels of sophistication&#x2014;ful lcolor artwork with higher and higher levels of character andcomposition. This movement gave way to a wave of master artists who eventually developed the most important and influential fantasy art from the late 1970s to today&#x2014;a collection simply unsurpassed in the fantasy genre.<br><br>The book you are holding is the dynamic story of this incredible game as told through its incomparable imagery, as well as the story of the visuals themselves. It is a carefully curated selection of art, advertising, and ephemera that we feel best represents D&amp;D&#x2019;s incredible forty-plus-year journey&#x2014;a visual archive that tells a remarkable story of evolution, innovation, turmoil, perseverance, and ultimately triumph. While we expect that much of the enclosed imagery will be at least remotely familiar to D&amp;D aficionados, the collection that follows includes numerous one-of-a-kind rarities, many of which have never been released to the public. We truly hope that you enjoy what you read and see, and that you as readers might approach this piece the same way we did&#x2014;with unadulterated passion and a taste for adventure. After all, this is an adventure module of sorts, one that is intended for you personally, just as it has been for each of us. &#x201c;So enjoy, and may the dice be good to you!&#x201d;</p><h2>Manual of Style for Contract Drafting</h2><p>Written by a practicing corporate lawyer and authority on legal drafting, this new Second Edition will completely update its first edition published in 2004.

The mountains were like a stairway to heaven, and the lush green rainforest was a rippling cloak of many colors. The sky was iridescent, swirling with the patterns of wind and clouds; sometimes it reflected the prisms of rainbow or southern aurora. The sea was ever-changing, shimmering and seamless to the sky. This was the well at the bottom of the world, and when you looked into it you felt you could see to the end of forever.<br><br> This is not to say that the land and sea were without life, without vivacity. The tuatara, the ancient lizard with its third eye, was sentinel here, unblinking in the hot sun, watching and waiting to the east. The moa browsed in giant wingless herds across the southern island. Within the warm stomach of the rainforests, kiwi, weka, and the other birds foraged for huhu and similar succulent insects. The forests were loud with the clatter of tree bark, chatter of cicada, and murmur of fish-laden streams. Sometimes the forest grew suddenly quiet, and in wet bush could be heard the filigree of fairy laughter like a sparkling glissando.<br><br> The sea, too, teemed with fish, but they also seemed to be waiting. They swam in brilliant shoals, like rains of glittering dust, throughout the greenstone depths-hapuku, manga, kahawai, tamure, moki, and warehou-herded by shark or mango ururoa. Sometimes from far off a white shape would be seen flying through the sea, but it would only be the serene flight of the tarawhai, the stingray with the spike on its tail.<br><br> Waiting. Waiting for the seeding. Waiting for the gifting. Waiting for the blessing to come.<br><br> Suddenly, looking up at the surface, the fish began to see the dark bellies of the canoes from the east. The first of the Ancients were coming, journeying from their island kingdom beyond the horizon. Then, after a period, canoes were seen to be returning to the east, making long cracks on the surface sheen. The land and the sea sighed with gladness:<br><br>We have been found.<br>The news is being taken back to the place of the Ancients.<br>Our blessing will come soon.<br><br> In that waiting time, earth and sea began to feel the sharp pangs of need, for an end to the yearning. The forests sent sweet perfumes upon the eastern winds and garlands of pohutukawa upon the eastern tides. The sea flashed continuously with flying fish, leaping high to look beyond the horizon and to be the first to announce the coming; in the shallows, the chameleon sea horses pranced at attention. The only reluctant ones were the fairy people, who retreated with their silver laughter to caves in glistening waterfalls.<br><br> The sun rose and set, rose and set. Then one day, at its noon apex, the first sighting was made. A spume on the horizon. A dark shape rising from the greenstone depths of the ocean, awesome, leviathan, breaching through the surface and hurling itself skyward before falling seaward again. Underwater the muted thunder boomed like a great door opening far away, and both sea and land trembled from the impact of that downward plunging.<br><br> Suddenly the sea was filled with awesome singing, a song with eternity in it, a song to the land:<br><br>You have called and I have come,<br>bearing the gift of the Gods.<br><br>The dark shape rising, rising again. A whale, gigantic. A sea monster. Just as it burst through the sea, a flying fish leaping high in its ecstasy saw water and air streaming like thunderous foam from that noble beast and knew, ah yes, that the time had come. For the sacred sign was on the monster, a swirling tattoo imprinted on the forehead.<br><br> Then the flying fish saw that astride the head, as it broke skyward, was a man. He was wondrous to look upon, the whale rider. The water streamed away from him and he opened his mouth to gasp in the cold air. His eyes were shining with splendor. His body dazzled with diamond spray. Upon that beast he looked like a small tattooed figurine, dark brown, glistening, and erect. He seemed, with all his strength, to be pulling the whale into the sky.<br><br> Rising, rising. And the man felt the power of the whale as it propelled itself from the sea. He saw far off the land long sought and now found, and he began to fling small spears seaward and landward on his magnificent journey toward the land.<br><br> Some of the spears in midflight turned into pigeons, which flew into the forests. Others, on landing in the sea, changed into eels. And the song in the sea drenched the air with ageless music, and land and sea opened themselves to him, the gift long waited for: tangata, man. With great gladness and thanksgiving, the man cried out to the land,<br>Karanga mai, karanga mai, karanga mai.<br><br> Call me. But there was one spear, so it is told, the last, that, when the whale rider tried to throw it, refused to leave his hand. Try as he might, the spear would not fly.<br><br> So the whale rider uttered a prayer over the wooden spear, saying, "Let this spear be planted in the years to come, for there are sufficient spear already implanted. Let this be the one to flower when the people are troubled and it is most needed."<br><br> And the spear then leaped from his hands with gladness and soared through the sky. It flew across a thousand years. When it hit the earth, it did not change but waited for another hundred and fifty years to pass until it was needed.<br><br> The flukes of the whale stroked majestically at the sky.<br><br> Hui e, haumi e, taiki e.<br><br> Let it be done.<br><br>� 1987 Witi Ihimaera<br><br>All rights reserved.

Ever innovative and predictably diverse in their physical formats, artists&#x2019; books occupy a creative space between the familiar four-cornered object and challenging works of art that effectively question every preconception of what a book can be. Many artists specialize in producing self-contained art projects in the form of books, like Ken Campbell and Susan King, or they establish small presses, like Simon Cutts and Erica Van Horn&#x2019;s Coracle Press or Harry and Sandra Reese&#x2019;s Turkey Press. Countless others who are primarily known as sculptors, painters, or performance artists carry on a parallel practice in artists&#x2019; books, including Anselm Kiefer, Annette Messager, Ed Ruscha, and Richard Tuttle. <i>Artists and Their Books / Books and Their Artists</i> includes over one hundred important examples selected from the Getty Research Institute&#x2019;s Special Collections of more than six thousand editions and unique artists&#x2019; books.<br> &nbsp;<br> This volume also presents precursors to the artist&#x2019;s book, such as Joris Hoefnagel&#x2019;s sixteenth-century calligraphy masterpiece; single-sheet episodes from Albrecht D�rer&#x2019;s <i>Life of Mary</i>, designed to be either broadsides or a book; early illustrated scientific works; and avant-garde publications.

She is a TCA member and an adjunct professor of radio, television, and film at Rowan University.Building Season Three: Writing<br><br>There are things that every show shares&#x2014;the long hours, the rewrites, and the difficulty of location scouting, to name a few. But what the creative team on <i>Outlander</i> discovered after two seasons is that their show will always be a beast to produce, no matter how well oiled the machine they&#x2019;ve created. Diana Gabaldon&#x2019;s books get more ambitious with each entry in the series, featuring multiple time lines, changing eras, exotic locales, and an everexpanding ensemble. <br><br>For the adaptation of <i>Voyager</i> as <i>Outlander</i>&#x2019;s third season, the biggest decision executive producers Ron D. Moore, Maril Davis, Matthew B. Roberts, and producer David Brown made was to leave Scotland and relocate to South Africa for the last half of the season, a huge undertaking for any series to make. &#x201c;Every year we try to come in more prepared,&#x201d; Maril Davis explains. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing better than having material early, but you can never prepare for the unexpected. Season three&#x2014;perhaps at first we underestimated. We thought that, certainly, the move to South Africa would be daunting, but I don&#x2019;t think we realized how daunting it all would be.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;For instance, in the first half of season three, which I think is some of the best work we&#x2019;ve done, we underestimated how difficult that would be, to do several different time periods,&#x201d; David Brown continues. &#x201c;We had Claire back in the forties, fifties, sixties. Then, we had Jamie back in the 1700s. There were so many hair [issues]. Certainly, for Gary [Steele] and his team, it was an immense hurdle to have to keep changing the Boston apartment for each decade.&#x201d; <br><br>Although <i>Outlander</i> adopted cross-board shooting&#x2014;shooting everything needed in blocks from any of the season&#x2019;s scripts, even if out of chronological order, to keep costs down&#x2014;the coordination and scheduling was still massive.<br><br> Behind the scenes, the day-today duties of the series also shifted. &#x201c;The third season felt like the time to delegate more,&#x201d; Ron Moore explains. &#x201c;I was definitely ready to stop being on the treadmill between Scotland and Los Angeles. It was time to give other people a chance to experience responsibility and authority and to come into their own. Matt, in particular, we started to give him more things to do, and Maril, and Toni Graphia. I think it creates, in the broader sense, a healthier business, because you&#x2019;re essentially mentoring and training people to discover their own talents and learn more. Then they can take that and make other great shows. <br><br>&#x201c;So I knew at the outset that episode one of season three was probably going to be the last first draft that I sat down and wrote for <i>Outlander</i>,&#x201d; Moore admits. &#x201c;That had a certain bittersweet quality to it, but it meant I would spend more time in editorial and postproduction in Los Angeles, which is one of my other great loves. Also, just generally speaking, I was starting to think about other [TV series] in development.&#x201d; <br><br>Davis then began to travel back and forth more from Los Angeles to Scotland and eventually South Africa. &#x201c;Matt started spending most of his time exclusively in Scotland in season three and really kept that ship afloat there. My job does not require me to be on set, as we always have a covering producer. But I like to be on set, because I like to know what&#x2019;s going on. I deal with casting, publicity, directors, and writers. So having Matt there for me, and for Ron, is essential. He is operating in a director-producerwriter role.&#x201d; <br><br>As the man on the ground for two years, shooting second unit, problem-solving, liaising with cast and crew, <i>and</i> writing, Roberts was ready to invest even more, including taking point with David Brown on transitioning their team to a new country for several months. &#x201c;Knowing where the story was going, we had already started to look way down the road, because we knew we needed ships and the Caribbean,&#x201d; Roberts says. &#x201c;For the first half of the season, we knew that half of the stories would be in Scotland, and that was a great thing because we were in Scotland. But to make that even more challenging, we were going to [make it into] period Boston, which makes it more exciting.&#x201d; <br><br>Of course, before anything else, the <i>Outlander</i> writers&#x2019; room convening in Los Angeles represented the official kick-off of season three. &#x201c;We were shooting season two and they started a pre-room early to break down the book,&#x201d; Roberts explains. &#x201c;So I was on the phone a lot and reading the [script] notes.&#x201d; <br><br>In the room, Moore, Davis, Graphia, and Roberts, initially remotely, were guiding the writing staff on how to dissect the big plot points from <i>Voyager</i> into the thirteen individual episodes for the season. From the top, they decided that Jamie and Claire would be in separate times and narratives until the huge printshop reunion, which is beloved by fans of the books. <br><br>&#x201c;Before the season even started, people were already asking the question of how long are you going to keep them apart?&#x201d; Graphia remembers. &#x201c;I would see people theorizing online. So we made the rule for ourselves that we will show them but never in the same frame. We wanted to do the sweet torture of keeping them apart for as long as we could. It&#x2019;s kind of the cardinal rule of TV writing; you don&#x2019;t keep your leads apart. But we found a way to make the scenes about the two of them without having them both in the scene. We kept them alive as a couple even though they weren&#x2019;t together.&#x201d; <br><br>Roberts adds, &#x201c;The only time we [broke that] was once in the very beginning, in Culloden, where Claire comes to Jamie in a dream, and that&#x2019;s it. We wanted the audience to wait for their big reunion, because we knew that was going to be the fulcrum of the season. The story really changes after that anyway. Getting back together is the first half. And then rescuing Ian is the second half.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And we always planned the reunion to be episode six,&#x201d; Graphia clarifies. &#x201c;I know that was way later than people were expecting,&#x201d; she chuckles. &#x201c;Even the network was like, &#x2018;What do you mean, six?&#x2019; I think they expected us to do it around three.&#x201d; <br><br>With the outline in place, Moore says, the writers then had to figure out how to show twenty years of living, on both sides, in the first five hours. &#x201c;To separate these two characters and to move through this big chunk of time in their lives, every moment had to count,&#x201d; he emphasizes. &#x201c;Every moment had to be chosen, not just because it was an interesting part of their lives, but because it also advanced the story and advanced the character&#x2019;s story along. <br><br>&#x201c;The book neatly delineated Jamie&#x2019;s story into chapters,&#x201d; Moore continues. &#x201c;Our first task when we sat down was, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s start with the Jamie story, because those are each going to be an episode, and let&#x2019;s lay out those episodes.&#x2019; Then we said, &#x2018;Now we need a Claire story that goes along with that,&#x2019; and that was more complicated, because you were drawing from various sources and the time lines didn&#x2019;t neatly line up. You couldn&#x2019;t have the same passage of time in Jamie&#x2019;s world and the same passage of time in Claire&#x2019;s world. There was a lot of complexity to try to figure out how Claire&#x2019;s story would mimic in some way Jamie&#x2019;s story over these multiple episodes. That&#x2019;s what took the most work. The Claire story definitely got reworked several times, whereas the Jamie one was always kind of clear.&#x201d; <br><br>The writers also learned from their previous two seasons that they had to figure out how to honor Gabaldon&#x2019;s narratives but be confident to take their own story path sometimes. &#x201c;The way Diana tells stories is different than the way you have to tell them onscreen,&#x201d; Roberts details. &#x201c;An event might take place in the book, and Diana will skip over it in the moment. We can&#x2019;t do that. We have to tell it in the moment, or it doesn&#x2019;t play. So, those are the big things that we have to adjust. We also have to deal with other living people, who are directors and actors, and production designers, and costume designers, who bring in their own interpretation of things that are on the page. When you bring it all together, it&#x2019;s so collaborative. And there were multiple times we wanted to put people together and they just weren&#x2019;t available, so we have to tell a different story.&#x201d;</p><h2>Cours Superieur De Francais (Workbook)</h2><p>Purpose: To provide a modern program for students who have completed three levels of French and who are ready to explore the language and literature of France in greater depth.

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice&#x2014;but the weight of history will only tolerate so much.</p><p>One of the best-loved classics of all time, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> has earned many dis-tinctions since its original publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer Prize, been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (<em>Library Journal</em>).&nbsp;</p></p><p><i>"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out."</i><p> Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up. </p><p> Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from <i>Dracula</i> and plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind "when you really see them." By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Featuring a new introduction by the author, this specially packaged, popularly priced hardcover edition of an American classic (with more than 30 million copies sold) celebrates the 35th anniversary of its original publication.</p><h2>Reconstructing Gender: A Multicultural Anthology</h2><p><i>Reconstructing Gender</i> is an anthology that addresses the contemporary experiences from a variety of women and men.

He dissects the global relationships between equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities like no one else can, and lays out an irrefutable case for intermarket analysis in plain English. This book is a must-read for all serious traders."<br> -Louis B. Mendelsohn, creator of VantagePoint Intermarket Analysis software<br> <br> "John Murphy's Intermarket Analysis should be on the desk of every trader and investor if they want to be positioned in the right markets at the right time."<br> -Thom Hartle, President, Market Analytics, Inc. (www.thomhartle.com)<br> <br> "This book is full of valuable information. As a daily practitioner of intermarket analysis, I thought I knew most aspects of this invaluable subject, but this book gave me several new ideas. I thoroughly recommend it for beginners and professionals."<br> -Martin Pring, President of Pring.com and editor of the Intermarket Review Newsletter<br> <br> "Mr. Murphy's Intermarket Analysis is truly the most efficient and unambiguous way to define economic and fundamental relationships as they unfold in the market. It cuts through all of the conflicting economic news/views expressed each day to provide a clear picture of the 'here and now' in the global marketplace."<br> -Dennis Hynes, Managing Director, R. W. Pressprich<br> <br> "Master Murphy is back with the quintessential look at intermarket analysis. The complex relationships among financial instruments have never been more important, and this book brings it all into focus. This is an essential read for all investors."<br> -Andrew Bekoff, Technical Strategist, VDM NYSE Specialists<br> <br> "John Murphy is a legend in technical analysis, and a master at explaining precisely how the major markets impact each other. This updated version provides even more lessons from the past, plus fresh insights on current market trends."<br> -Price Headley, BigTrends.com, author of Big Trends in Trading</p><p>Intermarket analysis has come a long way in the ten years since John Murphy wrote his groundbreaking Intermarket Technical Analysis: Trading Strategies for the Global Stock, Bond, Commodity, and Currency Markets. Although the idea that global markets were linked to each other was once viewed with skepticism, intermarket analysis is now considered among today?s most important technical disciplines. Today, market observers look to history for parallels that may predict future market performance.<p>In Intermarket Analysis: Profiting from Global Market Relationships, Murphy incorporates and reflects on the most recent world market data to show how seemingly disparate world markets interact and ultimately influence each other. Beginning with a brief overview of the intermarket changes that launched the bull market of the 1980s, Intermarket Analysis next revisits the stock market crash of 1987 and its importance to the development of intermarket theory. The author then discusses the 1990 bear market with emphasis on its relevance to later global events. Finally, the text offers in-depth coverage and analysis of the deflation trend that resulted in the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 followed by three years of stock market decline. </p><p>Citing recent world events that have had a profound impact on even longstanding economic relationships, Murphy shows us what earlier intermarket models are still working and, more importantly, what has changed. Based on the premise that intermarket analysis is not a "static" model, he examines the overall economic impact of such events as escalating tensions and wars in the Middle East, the decade-long downward spiral of the Japanese economy, and global over-investment in technology stocks. </p><p>Drawing on his vast experience as both an educator and an expert trader, the author lays out his key tools to understanding global markets and illustrates how these tools can help today?s serious investors profit in any economic climate. Armed with the knowledge of how economic forces impact the various markets and sectors, investors and traders can profit by exploiting opportunities in markets about to rise and avoiding those poised for a fall.</p><b>JOHN J.

Dr. Haider Warraich is a young and brilliant new voice in the conversation about death and dying started by Dr. Sherwin Nuland and Atul Gawande<i>. </i>Dr. Warraich takes a broader look at how we die today, from the cellular level up to the very definition of death itself. </p><p>The most basic aspects of dying&#x2015;the <i>whys, wheres, whens,</i> and <i>hows</i>&#x2015;are almost nothing like what they were mere decades ago. Beyond its ecology, epidemiology, and economics, the very ethos of death has changed. <i>Modern Death, </i>Dr. Warraich&#x2019;s debut book, will explore the rituals and language of dying that have developed in the last century, and how modern technology has not only changed the hows, whens, and wheres of death, but the what of death. </p><p>Delving into the vast body of research on the evolving nature of death, <i>Modern Death</i> will provide readers with an enriched understanding of how death differs from the past, what our ancestors got right, and how trends and events have transformed this most final of human experiences.</p></p><p>Dr. Haider Warraich graduated from medical school in Pakistan in 2009. He did his residency in internal medicine at Harvard Medical School&#x2019;s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, one of the main teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School. He is currently a fellow in cardiology at Duke University Medical Center. His medical and Op Ed pieces have appeared in many media outlets including the <i>New York Times, The Atlantic, </i>the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>,<i>Slate</i>, and the <i>LA Times </i>among others.<p>"Haider Warraich's elegant and poignant book takes us on an unforgettable journey. Warraich's quest is remarkable: he wants us to confront the act of dying. A caring and thoughtful doctor, he also writes beautifully&#x2015;drawing from his own patients and from statistics, medical ethics, literature and the sciences. He succeeds in humanizing a complex topic and gives us remarkable insights about the changing nature of<br>'modern death'."&#x2015;Siddhartha Mukherjee, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Emperor of All Maladies </i>and <i>The Gene</i></p><p>"Warraich demystifies what is known and unknown about how cells and bodies die, while sensitively grappling with the changing cultural landscape surrounding the end of life, including patients who tweet and share the details of their decline on social media. His story is filled with compassionate accounts of the different ways he has witnessed people meet death in the modern age."&#x2015;<b>Scientific American</b></p><p>"Medical advances have shifted the boundary between life and death, raising controversial questions for doctors and patients.

Kiernan, author of <i>Last Rights</i> and <i>The Hummingbird</i></p><br><p>"Melding the curiosity of a historian, the discernment of a physician, and the soulfulness of a poet, Haider Warraich provides us a stunning portrait of death in our moment. The modern aspiration to explicate our suffering collides ironically here with an age-old awe at what can only be deeply felt. In revealing just how breathtakingly far science has taken us in understanding the end of life, Dr. Warraich yet honors the fundamental truth that we may never conquer our mortality&#x2015;and that in dying, we are most fully human.<br>"&#x2015;Rafael Campo, MD, Associate Professor, Harvard Medical School, and author<i> of Alternative Medicine</i></p><p>"From the minutest exploration of how cells die to the larger philosophical questions about life and death, Haider Warraich invites the reader to contemplate the art and science of death and dying. The author brings us through the 'medicalization' of death and returns us to a deep humanity that we seem to have lost along the way. That he does this lyrically and with brilliance, courage, and humility sets this book apart. <i>Modern Death</i> is informative and beautifully written. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down."&#x2015;Eve Joseph, author of <i>In the Slender Margin</i></p><p>"Warraich delivers a detailed and data-rich study of the history of human death without avoiding the primary characteristics that define the ends of lives today: denial, inequality, overtreatment, and institutionalization. As a growing elder population and rapidly advancing medical technology continue to warp and change health care, doctors serve as our best scouts and guides.

In a smart, contemplative, and appealingly humble voice, he dissects the mysteries of CPR and DNR, brain death, and slow codes, and exposes the bizarre fact that most hospital deaths are handled by the youngest and least experienced doctors. Ultimately, he guides us back to a place where the take-home message remains the same, that at the end of life, being there - with family, with community, with clarity - is what matters now, and forever."&#x2015;Anna Reisman ,M.D., Director, Humanities in Medicine, Yale School of Medicine</p><p>"<i>Modern Death</i> tells the most compelling story: how something that once seemed so simple &#x2015; the difference between life and death &#x2015; became so complicated, and so important.

I loved it."&#x2015;Daniel Wallace, author of <i>Big Fish</i></p><p>"Warraich supplements his research with anecdotes from his personal experience, and draws on literature, theology, statistics and legal theory as well as the hard sciences.

We made a small patterned book about one of the stuffed animals in the classroom.&nbsp; I wrote some of the words and the students supplied the others, and I duplicated copies of the book for each child.&nbsp; We practiced reading it until everyone memorized our little book.&nbsp; The children proudly took their books home to read to their parents. I&#x2019;ve never forgotten that child&#x2019;s comment and what it taught me:&nbsp; Teachers must understand their students and meet their expectations.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first few years of teaching left me with more questions than answers, and I wanted to become a more effective teacher so I started taking graduate courses.&nbsp; In time I earned a master&#x2019;s degree and then a doctorate in Reading/Language Arts, both from Virginia Tech.&nbsp; Through my graduate studies, I learned a lot of answers, but more importantly, I learned to keep on asking questions.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I began teaching at the university level.&nbsp; First I taught at Miami University in Ohio, then at the University of Oklahoma, and finally at California State University, Fresno. I&#x2019;ve taught preservice teachers and practicing teachers working on master&#x2019;s degrees, and I&#x2019;ve directed doctoral dissertations. I&#x2019;ve received awards for my teaching, including the Provost&#x2019;s Award for Excellence in Teaching at California State University, Fresno, and I was inducted into the California Reading Association&#x2019;s Reading Hall of Fame.

Crowley's text is given in it's entirety (the few exceptions are noted in the text), as his is the most superb introduction to the Science of Illumination written in the West. Section IV currently consists of The Book of the Law, but does not contain the full text of its history and reception included in the full edition of The Equinox of the Gods. The first four sections present a full course in Magick &amp; Mysticism and thelemic theology the fifth section gives an example of what experimental magick can create in the illustration of the mysteries revealed by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly and the medieval magick of the Solomonic grimoires (in this case the Goetia) the sixth section provides an example of a unique manifestation of New Aeonic occult theory the seventh section provides an introduction into a specific esoteric empowerment held by a small group of adepts.<br><br>Other than those sections by Crowley (sections 1-4 and Liber Chanokh in section 5), all other material is the creation of the editor. In the body of Crowley's text, the editor's comments are designated by [] and are relegated to the footnotes. The only other changes to Crowley's text is the standardization of citations to the Equinox. Parts I and II of Book Four were written before the completion of the first volume, thus Crowley cites the Equinox by number only. We modified all citations to conform to Equinox volume(number) format.

Connecting analytic, continental, and historical traditions, Brandom shows how dominant modes of thought in contemporary philosophy are challenged by Hegel.</p><p><i>A Spirit of Trust</i> is about the massive historical shift in the life of humankind that constitutes the advent of modernity. In his Critiques, Kant talks about the distinction between what things are in themselves and how they appear to us; Hegel sees Kant&#x2019;s distinction as making explicit what separates the ancient and modern worlds. In the ancient world, normative statuses&#x2015;judgments of what ought to be&#x2015;were taken to state objective facts. In the modern world, these judgments are taken to be determined by attitudes&#x2015;subjective stances. Hegel supports a view combining both of those approaches, which Brandom calls &#x201c;objective idealism&#x201d;: there is an objective reality, but we cannot make sense of it without first making sense of how we think about it.</p><p>According to Hegel&#x2019;s approach, we become agents only when taken as such by other agents. This means that normative statuses such as commitment, responsibility, and authority are instituted by social practices of reciprocal recognition. Brandom argues that when our self-conscious recognitive attitudes take the radical form of magnanimity and trust that Hegel describes, we can overcome a troubled modernity and enter a new age of spirit.</p></p><p>Robert B. Brandom is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh and a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the British Academy. He delivered the John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford and the Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia University. Brandom is the author of many books, including <i>Making It Explicit</i>, <i>Reason in Philosophy</i>, and <i>From Empiricism to Expressivism</i> (all from Harvard).&#x201c;This long-awaited book has been thirty years in the making. Brandom&#x2019;s <i>A Spirit of Trust</i> aspires to do for Hegel&#x2019;s <i>The Phenomenology of Spirit</i> what Strawson&#x2019;s <i>The Bounds of Sense</i> did for Kant&#x2019;s <i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>: to transpose a seminal work of German Idealism into the terminological idiom and argumentative key of anglophone analytic philosophy&#x2015;not only to render a past classic newly available to the present, but to transform the philosophical present through such a re-inheritance of its past.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Conant, University of Chicago</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A Spirit of Trust</i> will be the book that finally moves analytic philosophy from its Kantian phase to its Hegelian phase. Brandom has succeeded in bridging both the history&#x2013;systematic and the continental&#x2013;analytic divides in contemporary philosophy. To say that this book is highly anticipated would be a gross understatement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dean Moyar, Johns Hopkins University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Brandom&#x2019;s goal is to make Hegel explicable to a new audience, to make the importance of his philosophy plain and to further develop his own impressive body of work. He has succeeded, and his success throws up fascinating questions for both American philosophy and critical theory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. D.

It accommodates four of our five senses, encases the brain, and boasts the most expressive set of muscles in the body. It is our most distinctive attribute and connects our inner selves to the outer world. Yet there is a dark side to the head&#x2019;s preeminence, one that has, in the course of human history, manifested itself in everything from decapitation to headhunting. So explains anthropologist Frances Larson in this fascinating history of decapitated human heads. From the Western collectors whose demand for shrunken heads spurred massacres to Second World War soldiers who sent the remains of the Japanese home to their girlfriends, from Madame Tussaud modeling the guillotined head of Robespierre to Damien Hirst photographing decapitated heads in city morgues, from grave-robbing phrenologists to skull-obsessed scientists, Larson explores our macabre fixation with severed heads. 25 illustrations</p><p>Frances Larson is an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Durham and the author of An Infinity of Things: How Sir Henry Wellcome Collected the World and Severed.

For some, they have been happy years; to others, fate has not been kind. In short, it is a book about America and how it has progressed from the 1930s to the 1970s, about fathers and sons, prejudice and courage, triumph and disaster.

What follows only gets better, deeper, more sentimental, and more bittersweet. The team, of course, is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience. It is the rare sports book that cannot be contained by the limitations of its genre; it is equal parts journalism, memoir, social history, and poetry.Roger Kahn is the award-winning author of The Boys of Summer, the classic bestseller about Jackie Robinson, the Dodgers and growing up in Brooklyn.

Previously known as Gone Fishin', this book has brought Jay Rubin more feedback than any of his literary translations or scholarly tomes, "even if," he says, "you discount the hate mail from spin-casters and the stray gill-netter." <br><br>To convey his conviction that "the Japanese language is not vague," Rubin has dared to explain how some of the most challenging Japanese grammatical forms work in terms of everyday English. Reached recently at a recuperative center in the hills north of Kyoto, Rubin declared, "I'm still pretty sure that Japanese is not vague. Or at least, it's not as vague as it used to be. Probably." <br><br>The notorious "subjectless sentence" of Japanese comes under close scrutiny in Part One. A sentence can't be a sentence without a subject, so even in cases where the subject seems to be lost or hiding, the author provides the tools to help you find it. Some attention is paid as well to the rest of the sentence, known technically to grammarians as "the rest of the sentence." <br><br>Part Two tackles a number of expressions that have baffled students of Japanese over the decades, and concludes with Rubin's patented technique of analyzing upside-down Japanese sentences right-side up, which, he claims, is "far more restful" than the traditional way, inside-out. <br><br>"The scholar," according to the great Japanese novelist Soseki Natsume, is "one who specializes in making the comprehensible incomprehensible." Despite his best scholarly efforts, Rubin seems to have done just the opposite. <br><br>Previously published in the <em>Power Japanese</em> series under the same title and originally as Gone Fishin' in the same series.</p><p><br>JAY RUBIN is a professor of Japanese literature at Harvard University, where he has employed the pedagogical techniques contained in Making Sense of Japanese "as infrequently as possible." He has authored Injurious to <em>Public Morals: Writers and the Meiji State and Haruki Murakami and the Music of</em> <em>Words</em>, edited <em>Modern Japanese Writers</em>, and translated Soseki Natsume's <em>Sanshiro</em> and <em>The Miner</em> and Haruki Murakami's <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em>, <em>Norwegian Wood</em>, and <em>After the Quake</em> (Knopf and Harvill, 2002).<br>[Following is a self-contained section from the book, minus the original macrons.] <p>Fiddlers Three = Three Fiddlers? </p><p>Old King Cole called for "his fiddlers three" mainly because they rhymed with "soul was he." If questions of rhyme and meter hadn't entered into the picture, he could just as well have called for "his three fiddlers," who, we know from the "his," were a unit of some sort. If we wanted to keep them as a unit in Japanese, however, we couldn't be quite so indifferent about word order. </p><p>Old King Koroku would have Sannin no baiorin-hiki o yobiyoseta rather than Baiorin-hiki o sannin yobiyoseta. The second version would mean "He called for three fiddlers," three chosen at random rather than the self-contained string band he was used to. </p><p>The normal place to put counters is after the noun in question, where it functions as an adverb telling to what extent the verb is to be performed. Enpitsu o sanbon kudasai means "Please give me three pencils"--any three pencils out of a larger supply. Sanbon no enpitsu, with the counter now modifying the noun itself, means "Please give me the three pencils." </p><p>Kurosawa's movie about a group of "seven samurai" is called Shichinin no samurai.

When he refused to join the Nazi party he was arrested by the Gestapo&#x2014;who eventually released him, but thereafter regularly summoned him for &#x201c;discussions&#x201d; of his work.<br><br> However, unlike Mann, Hesse, and others, Fallada refused to flee to safety, even when his British publisher, George Putnam, sent a private boat to rescue him. The pressure took its toll on Fallada, and he resorted increasingly to drugs and alcohol for relief. After Goebbels ordered him to write an anti-Semitic novel, he snapped and found himself imprisoned in an asylum for the &#x201c;criminally insane&#x201d;&#x2014;considered a death sentence under Nazi rule. To forestall the inevitable, he pretended to write the assignment for Goebbels, while actually composing three encrypted books&#x2014;including his tour de force novel <i>The Drinker</i>&#x2014;in such dense code that they were not deciphered until long after his death.<br><br> Fallada outlasted the Reich and was freed at war&#x2019;s end. But he was a shattered man. To help him recover by putting him to work, Fallada&#x2019;s publisher gave him the Gestapo file of a simple, working-class couple who had resisted the Nazis.

But by the 1850s, the population of enslaved Americans had increased exponentially, and such legislative efforts as the Fugitive Slave Act and the Supreme Court's 1857 ruling in the Dred Scott case effectively voided any rights black Americans held as enslaved or free people. As conditions deteriorated for African Americans, black abolitionist leaders embraced violence as the only means of shocking Northerners out of their apathy and instigating an antislavery war.</p> <p>In <em>Force and Freedom</em>, Kellie Carter Jackson provides the first historical analysis exclusively focused on the tactical use of violence among antebellum black activists. Through rousing public speeches, the bourgeoning black press, and the formation of militia groups, black abolitionist leaders mobilized their communities, compelled national action, and drew international attention. Drawing on the precedent and pathos of the American and Haitian Revolutions, African American abolitionists used violence as a political language and a means of provoking social change. Through tactical violence, argues Carter Jackson, black abolitionist leaders accomplished what white nonviolent abolitionists could not: creating the conditions that necessitated the Civil War. <em>Force and Freedom</em> takes readers beyond the honorable politics of moral suasion and the romanticism of the Underground Railroad and into an exploration of the agonizing decisions, strategies, and actions of the black abolitionists who, though lacking an official political voice, were nevertheless responsible for instigating monumental social and political change.</p> <p>Chosen as a finalist for the Museum of African American History's Stone Book Award.</p></p><p>Kellie Carter Jackson teaches in the Africana Studies Department at Wellesley College.

While the day marked the legal abolition of slavery in the British West Indies, it also represented what was possible for America: the eventual nonviolent abolition of slavery. However, for the well-known physician and abolitionist James McCune Smith, August 1 was incomplete, at best, and a farce, at worst. He refused to celebrate the holiday and criticized those who did. The son of former slaves, McCune Smith wrote an essay that appeared in <i>Frederick Douglass Paper</i> in August 1856. In the essay, he condemned British emancipation as merely a faulty compromise between slaves and their white masters, whom the British government generously compensated for their loss of property, thereby legitimizing the notion that slaves were less than human. Yet the government made virtually no effort to compensate the enslaved. "A paltry twenty thousand pounds was appropriated for the education of the freed men," McCune Smith lamented. "That is all given to the former slave in consideration of the robbery and embruting [<i>sic</i>] which has been perpetuated on him for centuries."<p></p><p>What vexed McCune Smith the most was the notion that British emancipation had been "a boon conferred" rather than "a right seized upon and held." Consequently, he mocked celebrants by mimicking an old 1848 blackface minstrel song, "Masa gib me holiday." Were black Americans to hope for abolition as a gift from slave owners acting of their own free will? According to McCune Smith, true freedom could not be bestowed; it had to be won. Violent upheaval was "the order of things." Teaching children to celebrate <i>given freedom</i> needed to stop, he insisted, as this was not the kind of freedom worth having. "Our freedom must be won and the sooner we wake up to the fact, the better," he warned his readers.</p><p>Harkening back to the electric feeling that inspired numerous slave rebellions, McCune Smith subsequently praised leaders such as Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, and the brave men and women who fought during the Christiana Resistance of 1851. These violent acts effectively shed light on the future of black Americans, he contended. "Our white brethren cannot understand us unless we speak to them in their own language; they recognize only the philosophy of force," he explained. According to McCune Smith, expecting white Americans to embrace black humanity required physical engagement. "They will never recognize our manhood until we knock them down a time or two," he exclaimed. Black resistance and violence was central to understanding their antidote to American slavery.</p><p>Force and Freedom</p><p>In the history of the movement to abolish slavery, the shift toward violence among African Americans remains largely unaddressed. In addition, the ways in which black abolitionists utilized violence deserves a more sustained and nuanced analysis. Black resistance was central to abolitionism. Accordingly, <i>Force and Freedom: Black Abolitionists and the Politics of Violence</i> actively examines one of the perennial questions in political thought: is violence a valid means of producing social change? Specifically, this study addresses how black abolitionists answered this question. Black abolitionist ideology not only explains how the politics of violence paved the way for the Civil War, but how the politics of violence helped prepare the nation to view black people as equal Americans with inalienable rights. <i>Force and Freedom</i> is the first of its kind to offer a close look at the complex and varied ways violence was deployed by antebellum black activists.</p><p>While praising the efforts of a few notable men and women abolitionists, most contemporary discussions of the subject routinely lament that nothing good can come from political violence. On the contrary, few good things can be acquired from those in power except by force, often violent force. A retreat from engaging in a complex understanding of the political purposes of violence limits both how we see and make use of the past. Within the field, there is a propensity to privilege the performance of nonviolence and deny the possibility and utility of violence as the great accelerator in American emancipation.</p><p>Historiography typically follows the chronological pattern of moral suasion in the 1830s, political abolition in the 1840s, and separatism and emigration in the 1850s. Some historians see the shift from moral suasion to violence as one of declension, with African Americans giving in to despair in the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Others see the antebellum period as the moment in which the maturation of a black nationalist consciousness calcified. I align my work with the more recent scholarship of Manisha Sinha, Patrick Rael, Matthew Clavin, and W. Caleb McDaniel, who see this moment as part of the creation of an alternative revolutionary tradition in an age of revolution. I see black abolitionism as a movement that began almost at the inception of Atlantic world slavery and understood the idea and experience of violence more than any other group.</p><p><i>Force and Freedom</i> examines the political and social tensions preceding the American Civil War, as well as the conditions that led many black abolitionists to believe slavery could be abolished only through violent measures. By exploring black abolitionists' shift from a campaign of moral persuasion in the 1830s to their push for more combative and violent strategies to end American slavery in the 1850s, I explain the various moments that cultivated their desire for force. The purpose of this study is fourfold: First, I draw scholarly attention to why black abolitionist leaders prioritized violence over nonviolence as a means for liberation. Second, I explore the factors that precipitated and accelerated this change of perspective toward the use of violence. Third, I address the ways in which black leaders arrived at a place of mutual agreement, differing with the tactics of various white abolitionist leaders who evoked and employed violence. Fourth, I reveal how the expanding influence of the black abolitionist movement&#x2014;from its early orators, to the black press, to the formation of militia groups&#x2014;illustrates the power of black abolitionists to mobilize their communities, compel national action, and draw international attention. Within the racially charged context of antebellum America, I draw attention to the immense importance of violence to imagining emancipation and, in turn, freedom into being.</p><p>Why Violence?</p><p><i>Force and Freedom</i> could just as easily be expressed as force <i>for</i> freedom. The paradox of using force and violence to bring about freedom and ensure peace is common within our own western political context. Violence is the double-edged sword of democracy. In the quest for freedom, violence becomes a necessary liberating force when it is the only remaining option. Understanding political violence is often about understanding an ideology of last resorts. In many ways, this study is an analysis of "last resorts" among black Americans. This study asks: should the enslaved or free black people be forced to obey laws that do not grant them the rights to shape such laws?</p><p>Throughout the book, I refer to violence as political or use the phrase "political violence," by which I mean forceful or deadly acts that operate around a political agenda or motivation to produce change. I understand history as struggles for power and contestations over meaning, influence, and governance. Everything about slavery and its abolition was contested. White planters and politicians perceived abolitionists' and African Americans' aggression as a threat to their own power. And though some scholars may not recognize leaders of slave rebellions or black abolitionists as politicians, their roles were indeed political.</p><p>Additionally, violence became a political language for African American abolitionists. That is to say, black leaders addressed how violence became a way of communicating and provoking political and social change. Along the lines of McCune Smith's "philosophy of force," imagining violence as a language helps scholars of nineteenth-century African American history understand both how power is maintained and how power is disseminated through conventional and unconventional channels.</p><p>The era of revolutions set an early example for understanding violence as both a rhetorical and physical weapon to maintain the status quo, as well as the means to overthrow it. The historian Fran�ois Furstenberg argues that, during the nineteenth century, Patrick Henry's famous mandate "Give me liberty or give me death" was the greatest revolutionary slogan of all time. Thus the idea among black abolitionists that freedom denied should be taken by force was not new. The contagious egalitarian language of the eighteenth and nineteenth century erupted in a set of expectations and bore serious consequences. The revolutionary rhetoric and force deployed by the Founding Fathers offered black abolitionists an opportunity to present themselves as equal men whose struggle mirrored that of American revolutionaries. Inadvertently, the Founding Fathers supplied the language and ideology for black abolitionists to rationalize a violent overthrow of slavery. Meanwhile, Haitian revolutionaries provided the precedent.</p><p>The successful overthrow of slavery during the Haitian Revolution supplied the first example of a black revolutionary victory achieved through violence. For black abolitionists, an independent Haiti represented the impossible made possible. The Haitian Revolution, and the slave rebellions more generally, served to illustrate the fact that political violence was a direct and inevitable consequence of slavery and oppression. Black abolitionists offered the Haitian Revolution as a constant reminder of how they could overthrow the institution of slavery in America. For the enslaved and black leadership, violence as a political language meant that Haiti was more than a noun; it was a verb. These examples imbued black Americans with the confidence to assert that equality and authority was not divine, hereditary, or accidental but that most societies and individual conditions could be logically engineered. In other words, a radical change in society and social structure could be produced, even by those possessing the least access to power. Thus violence had a democratizing effect; it created opportunities for any enslaved or oppressed free person to engage in a political and physical pushback to their oppressive conditions. In short, black resistance to slavery offered Americans an opportunity to perfect democracy.</p><p>The son of former slaves, James Theodore Holly was an abolitionist who later emigrated to the island of Haiti, which became its own black independent nation in 1803. In the 1850s, in pointing to the hypocrisy of American independence, Holly described the inspiration that Haiti offered to black reformers. "The revolution of this country [America] was only the revolt of a people already comparatively free, independent, and highly enlightened," he posited. Meanwhile, "the Haitian Revolution was a revolt of an uneducated and menial class of slaves, against their tyrannical oppressors who not only imposed an absolute tax on their unrequited labor, but also usurped their very bodies." Holly did not believe that American colonists could rightly call themselves oppressed. For Holly, revolutions required a sense of legitimacy greater than the 1773 Tea Act. In other words, "a three pence per pound tax on tea" was not a sufficient grievance. With an equal level of seriousness and humor, he wrote, "The obstacles to surmount, and the difficulties to contend against, in the American revolution, when compared to those of the Haytian, were, (to use a homely but classic phrase,) but a 'tempest in a teapot.'" For black abolitionists, the American and Haitian Revolutions involved more than a set of enlightened principles: each provided the rationale and means through which to accomplish abolition.</p><p>Many black leaders began to argue that violent political discourse was completely in line with American religious traditions and early liberal republican views. In a letter published in the <i>North Star</i>, for example, fugitive slaves declared, "If the American revolutionists had excuse for shedding but one drop of blood, then have the American slaves excuse for making blood to flow 'even unto the horse-bridles.'" For them, words such as "freedom," "liberty," "resistance," and "slavery" created dichotomies that functioned and thrived on urgency. Phrases used during the revolution, such as "rebellion to tyrants was obedience to God" and the well-known axiom "he who would be free must himself strike the first blow," carried with them a set of beliefs that, for those yearning for their own freedom, connected politics and political discourse with violence.</p><p>Changing Views</p><p>During the 1830s, the formal beginning of the abolitionist movement emerged out of a sense of religious fervor and optimism. Spiritual revival and a belief that Christ's return was imminent engendered a second Great Awakening, which influenced the belief among abolitionists that moral suasion coupled with nonviolent resistance was the best and surest way to abolish slavery. Many of the early abolitionists believed that moral suasion would work to end slavery.</p><p>The white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison emerged as a leading proponent of nonviolent ideology and nonpolitical action within the antislavery movement. In the face of angry mobs, arson attacks, and other acts of brutality, Garrison instructed abolitionists to "turn the other cheek." And, for some time, they did. All efforts outside nonresistance were shunned, even in self-defense. Yet, twenty years into the abolitionist movement, American slavery had expanded, the enslaved population had doubled, and abolitionists were no closer to freedom than when they began the American Antislavery Society in 1833. For black leadership, the notion of nonresistance popularized by Garrison had all but collapsed. During the two decades, abolitionists devoted to the campaign for emancipation and leaders of the antislavery movement had become morally exhausted. At each turn, it appeared that the Slave Power&#x2014;a term used to describe the dominating political, economic, and social influence of slaveholders&#x2014;wielded unlimited control over the fate of black Americans. Effectively, none of the new laws established during the antebellum period served to revive abolitionist optimism.</p><p>If nonviolent resistance and moral suasion constructed the house that Garrison built, black Americans were merely renters. They never fully owned nonresistance principles. Within the movement, black abolitionists, black freedmen, and the enslaved were most susceptible to the brunt of proslavery violence. When white antiabolitionist mobs attacked, it was predominantly black businesses, homes, and churches that were destroyed.

She divides her time between the UK and the US.<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>Many years ago I was a new and inexperienced teacher, fresh out of teachers&#x2019; college at New York University. In my ?rst post I noticed that in some classrooms the children were shouting out, ?nding excuses to get out of their seats, throwing paper airplanes across the room as soon as the teacher&#x2019;s back was turned, and ignoring the teacher&#x2019;s repeated pleas for silence. But in other classrooms the pupils were sitting where they had been told; they were concentrating and learning&#x2014;and smiling. Clearly they were enjoying school, and they were proud of what they were achieving.</p><p>I was in awe of the excellent teachers who were able to motivate and inspire. I could see that it was not a coincidence that these were also the teachers who were able to give an instruction and know that it would be carried out. Within my ?rst few days in the classroom I became painfully aware that my four years of teacher-training had taught me almost nothing about how to manage a classroom. I had learned a lot about how to teach, but the unspoken assumption of my professors had been that all I had to do was turn up, and I would be greeted by a classroom full of quiet, motivated children gazing up at me raptly with sunshiny faces, eager to soak up everything I could teach them.</p><p>I had assumed, without having given it much thought, that I would enjoy teaching and that I would be good at it. But I saw immediately that I just wasn&#x2019;t equipped for reality. The pupils in this school did not automatically respect teachers. These children did not believe that it was their job to pay attention or do their best. So during my lunch hours in the staff room I listened carefully to the conversations of the seasoned veterans, hoping to learn the secrets of their success. I approached the teachers I admired and asked them how they managed to achieve such calm, focused classrooms.</p><p>One kindly teacher tried to reassure me: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, dear. In a few years you&#x2019;ll get the hang of it.&#x201d; This did not reassure me because I was worried that unless I ?gured out how to bring order to my classroom, I wouldn&#x2019;t last a few years. One teacher, whom I frequently heard shouting at her unruly class, interrupted to give me this piece of advice: &#x201c;These children! They&#x2019;re animals! Don&#x2019;t expect too much from them, and you won&#x2019;t be disappointed.&#x201d; I knew that couldn&#x2019;t be right because there were a handful of teachers at the school who had earned the respect of their pupils. These teachers expected a great deal from their pupils, and they were not disappointed.</p><p>One teacher tried to explain: &#x201c;You just have to show them you mean business.&#x201d; This sounded promising, but it didn&#x2019;t tell me how. Another teacher told me, &#x201c;You have to show them you believe they can do good work.&#x201d; This also sounded good, but once again, I didn&#x2019;t know <i>how</i>. And another teacher told me, &#x201c;You just have to let them know who&#x2019;s boss.&#x201d; When I asked the all-important how, I was told, &#x201c;You just have to put your foot down.&#x201d; I felt like asking, &#x201c;Which foot?&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that these excellent teachers had been good at their job for so many years that they no longer had to think about how they got the results they got. They just didn&#x2019;t know how to put into words what they were doing that worked. So, sadly, they were not able to give me any useful advice.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I began carefully observing those teachers and taking detailed notes on what they did and how they did it, what they said and how they said it. From distilling and studying my notes I realized that it was not any intrinsic quality of a teacher that got the children to behave and want to learn, but certain techniques the teachers used. I ?gured I had nothing to lose, so I started using these same techniques with my class, even though I was not con?dent that I could pull it off. I hoped that with time and practice I would eventually start getting some good results.</p><p>To my intense delight, the techniques started working within days. When I started doing what those effective teachers did, the kids quickly responded to me as if I were one of those senior teachers I admired so much. Within weeks, not years as that teacher in the staff room had predicted, I started to feel con?dent that I could achieve what I set out to do.</p><p>I was amazed when other teachers started noticing. One teacher said, &#x201c;Has Frank B. been absent recently? I haven&#x2019;t had to scold him in assembly for a while,&#x201d; and another teacher replied, &#x201c;No, he hasn&#x2019;t been absent. He&#x2019;s just much quieter now. No�l&#x2019;s working her magic on him.&#x201d; Soon I found that teachers were asking me, a rank beginner, for advice on how to handle the dif? cult kids!</p><p>Then the parents started asking me for advice. They could see that I was able to get their little rebels to sit and listen and do their work in school, so surely I would know how to get them to do their homework or go to bed without a tantrum or do what they were told. I was ?attered to be asked, but as I had no children at the time I felt I had no useful advice to give these parents. All I could think of to say was, &#x201c;This is what I&#x2019;m doing in the classroom, and it&#x2019;s working. Why not try it at home?&#x201d; Within days, parents came back to me saying, &#x201c;It works!&#x201d;</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I realized that a lot of parenting is really teaching, and that anyone can learn the techniques to become a more skilled teacher, and consequently a more skilled parent. I learned that the behaviors and habits that annoy or trouble us in our children can be improved, and in many cases completely erased, once we start thinking about each problem as a teaching opportunity.</p><p>As I continued working with children, and then with parents and teachers, I learned more and more about how to help children become more cooperative, con?dent, motivated, self-reliant, and considerate. My fascination with this subject led me to further study. And as a mother, stepparent, and foster parent (and now as a grandmother) I learned even more. Over the years I learned about the effects of temperament on behavior, and how children with extreme temperaments can be helped to develop more balanced responses. I learned that many children with behavior problems are suffering from subtle and often unrecognized learning dif?culties, and that addressing the learning problems always improves behavior and attitude. I learned that chronic stress undermines a parent&#x2019;s best efforts, and what can be done to reduce stress. Gradually I put together into one comprehensive package all the techniques, skills, strategies, and principles that I could see worked. I call this method Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting and Teaching.</p><p>Over time I went from advising parents at the school gates to giving seminars, courses, and lectures. My next step was opening a center for families. Then I put what I had learned into books and CDs and DVDs so that parents who did not live near London could bene?t from these techniques. As the word spread, I started to ?ll the need by training Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting practitioners who coach parents worldwide, in person or by telephone.</p><p>Parents always tell us that their biggest frustration is having to repeat instructions numerous times before their children listen and cooperate. As you read this book, you will see that the Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting approach gives you a step-by-step method to solve this problem (and many other typical family problems). Using positive and respectful techniques, parents can guide children into the habit of cooperating the ?rst time and without a fuss most of the time.</p><p>In this book you will ?nd strategies that will transform many typical family issues&#x2014;everything from homework and music practice and sibling rivalry to cleaning up and bedtimes and mealtimes. These strategies teach children to see themselves as capable, considerate, and worthy of appreciation. This method helps parents to feel more relaxed and more con? dent in their role as parents. And it makes family life signi? cantly calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p>In the forty years that I have been consulting with parents, I have never seen these techniques fail. It gives me great pleasure to share them with you now.</p><br><br><p><b>Section One </b></p><p><b>FIVE CORE STRATEGIES FOR CREATING A CALMER, EASIER, HAPPIER FAMILY LIFE </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER 1 </b></p><p><b>WHAT MAKES MODERN PARENTING SO STRESSFUL, AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT </b></p><p><b>Changing frustration to freedom </b></p><p><i>I used to regularly shout at my children around bedtime. And, like clockwork, as soon as they were finally asleep, I would slump onto the sofa, almost in tears, so frustrated and feeling bad about myself. It happened so many evenings. I would vow to be more patient and calm. What I didn&#x2019;t realize back then was that I didn&#x2019;t have a clue how to get them to do what I asked. So I was making a vow that I just couldn&#x2019;t keep. </i></p><p><i>Now I have the tools so my children do cooperate most of the time. Life is calmer; I&#x2019;m not spending time bargaining, negotiating, and shouting; and I actually have time to get some of the things done that I need to do! </i></p><p>Mother of three, ages 9, 7, and 4</p><p>When I&#x2019;m talking to a roomful of parents, laughter always erupts when I say to them, &#x201c;It would be a whole lot easier to be a parent if we didn&#x2019;t have kids. They slow you down. They get in the way. They make a fuss while you&#x2019;re trying to get something done.&#x201d;</p><p>As parents, we can all identify with this. Our &#x201c;to-do list&#x201d; is pages long. Yet when we cradled our newborn in our arms and looked lovingly into his eyes, we didn&#x2019;t think, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to hand you over to someone else so I can get on with all my tasks.&#x201d; Of course we wanted to nurture and spend time with our child. We envisioned a life of calm and happy parenting.</p><p>But the reality is that many of us are juggling work, children&#x2019;s schedules, volunteer commitments, managing household chores, et cetera. We have an agenda, and we&#x2019;re constantly looking ahead to see what needs to get done. When our kids aren&#x2019;t listening or doing what we ask, it is incredibly frustrating. We ?nd ourselves losing patience and feeling stressed because of all the hassle&#x2014;the repeating, reminding, negotiating, and shouting we have to do to get our kids to do all the things that need to be done each day!</p><p>Does this sound familiar? It may be that you&#x2019;ve picked up this book because you are at your wits&#x2019; end from dealing with whining, de?ance, tantrums, and disrespect or with mealtime, bedtime, or homework battles. It may be that one of your children has a relatively more extreme temperament&#x2014;more sensitive, more intense, and more in?exible&#x2014;and you are at a loss as to how to parent this child. It may be that the problems you are dealing with are quite mild, and you just want to learn positive and effective strategies to help you be the best parent you can be.

In this book I will give you speci? c strategies and skills to signi?cantly improve cooperation and all the other habits that you want your child to develop. I will share with you ways to make the job of parenting calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p><b>The unique challenges that modern parents face </b></p><p>Why is parenting more stressful today, and what makes our to-do lists so long? Certainly being a parent in modern times presents new and different challenges from those our parents faced. Parents experience more stress today for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Most of us don&#x2019;t have extended family living nearby to support us. There is pressure on parents to ful?ll an impossible number of roles, especially in families with two working parents&#x2014;an ever-increasing percentage. With parents working longer and longer hours, tasks such as food shopping, cleaning, and cooking are increasingly experienced as hurried and stressful.</p><p>Modern telecommunications have made it almost impossible for parents to completely switch off. Cell phones and the Internet have crept into every corner of our lives&#x2014;our homes, our cars, our purses, our pockets, and attached to our ears. On the one hand, technology makes our lives easier, and on the other hand, the communication and the pressure to respond are coming at us 24/7!</p><p>Another role that affects our stress level is that of &#x201c;family taxi driver.&#x201d; The number of enriching activities kids have available to them today is staggering, and it starts in infancy! This is an enormous shift from our parents&#x2019; generation. Everything begins earlier for kids today: football, ballet, music lessons, and even yoga can all start by age three or younger! This presents opportunity, but also stress. We want to expose our children to lots of wonderful experiences, so we are enticed by all these enriching programs. Then, as much as our child may enjoy the activity, we end up in the role of chauffeur. All this carting them back and forth in traf?c to classes and matches plays havoc with our patience and raises our stress level. We ?nd ourselves overscheduled right alongside our children.</p><p>The perceived threat of &#x201c;stranger danger&#x201d; has also drastically changed how children play and consequently our job description. In addition to our other roles, we&#x2019;ve also become &#x201c;entertainment directors.&#x201d; It used to be that when kids came home from school, they had a snack, and then they were out the door. Parents had time to get things done while the children were out with the neighborhood kids, exploring, playing hide-and-seek, climbing trees, et cetera. Kids didn&#x2019;t come home until supper. Homework either didn&#x2019;t exist or was so minimal that it wasn&#x2019;t even on parents&#x2019; radar screens. Our parents didn&#x2019;t worry about sexual predators, so kids had the freedom to explore. Now kids are playing at home more, pleading for more screen time, exercising less, wanting us to play with them or to drive them to playdates.</p><p>Given the challenges facing modern parents, it is no wonder that we feel so stressed and are driven to nagging, threatening, criticizing, and shouting to try to make sure everything gets done that needs to get done every day. It&#x2019;s unlikely that any of these stressors will be going away, so it&#x2019;s up to us to ?nd ways to reduce family stress and to guide our children to become more cooperative so that parenting can be calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p><b>Parenting: The job with no training </b></p><p>Parenting is the most important job there is. But it&#x2019;s a job for which no training is generally given beyond childbirth classes. How can it be that a job as diverse and demanding as raising children can come without training? This isn&#x2019;t a management job we can just quit when it&#x2019;s hard and our employees are annoying us! Parenting is a job we have to get up and go to every day without pay. Of course it&#x2019;s also a job that can be incredibly rewarding. And we ?nd the job of parenting the most rewarding when we feel con?dent that the way we are parenting is positively impacting our children.</p><p>When we became parents, we were suddenly thrown into the role of educators. Most of us didn&#x2019;t go to school to become teachers, yet this is the job we perform every day with our children. In fact, teaching is our main job. I&#x2019;m not talking about teaching academic subjects. I&#x2019;m talking about teaching our children th...</p></p><h2>The Lay of the Land</h2><p>The Lay of the Land features fifteen nature sketches written from Sharp&#x2019;s personal observations of the land and its inhabitants over a number of years.

Interpreting the rich heritage of a site like Cahokia Mounds is a balancing act; the interpreter must speak as a scholar to the general public on behalf of an entirely different civilization. Since even those three groups are splintered into myriad dialects of perspective, sometimes it is hard to know what language to use. But William Iseminger&#39;s work at the site has given him nearly four decades of practice in Cahokia Conversation 101, and he tells the story of the place and its ancient culture (as well as its place in contemporary culture) with the clarity and confidence of a native speaker.</p><p>William R. Iseminger was born in Bloomington, Illinois, and grew up in Arlington, Virginia. He majored in anthropology in college, receiving his BA from the University of Oklahoma and his MA from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. He participated in excavations in South Dakota and several locations in Illinois, and he has worked at the Cahokia site full time since 1971. He directed public archaeological field schools for many years and serves as assistant site manager in charge of exhibits, interpretation and public relations at Cahokia for the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.</p><h2>The Unholy (Krewe of Hunters, 6)</h2><p><br><br><em>The 1940s:</em> Hard-boiled detectives and femmes fatale are box-office gold.

She was in that delightful stage of half sleep, when the alarm had gone off...but the snooze button was on and she had a few minutes to lie lazily in the comfort of her bed before rising. Her phone was loud and strident. She rolled over groping for it, swearing softly as it dropped to the floor and she had to lean down to get it, banging her head on the bedside table.<br><br>"Shit!" she muttered, and was further humiliated when she realized she'd hit Answer as she'd picked up the phone&#x2014;and the caller had heard her.<br><br>"Hello?" she said frowning. Seven thirty-three. Who was calling this early?<br><br>She could hear a soft chuckle, and then someone clearing his throat. "Madison?"<br><br>Inwardly, she groaned.<br><br>"Yes, Alfie?" Alfie Longdale was her assistant at the studio. She loved the fact that she had an assistant and she loved Alfie. One day, he was going to rule the world, his eye for detail was so exceptional.<br><br>"You don't have to come in this morning. In fact, you <em>can't</em> come in."<br><br>Her heart seemed to sink to her knees. Had someone suddenly decided she was really a fake? That, despite her training, degree and experience, she was just a kid who played at working on the movies?<br><br>"What...what&#x2014;?"<br><br>Alfie's voice became hushed. "There was a murder last night! In the tunnel. Lord, Madison, Alistair Archer was arrested for murder! Some little starlet he had the hots for&#x2014;they say her throat was slit from ear to ear. She's dead, Madison. And Eddie Archer's kid is saying that an Egyptian mummy&#x2014;you know, the priest in the original <em>Sam Stone</em> movie, a <em>monster</em>&#x2014;came down from one of the tableaux to commit the bloody carnage!"<br><br>Alfie was being dramatic. He <em>was</em> dramatic. But right now, what he'd said wasn't registering.<br><br>A mummy? A monster? Alfie had to be making it up. Monsters were what they did, what they created, quite frequently. Well, superheroes, giant rats for commercials, cute little pigs and other such creatures. But horror was big; horror movies could be reasonable in cost and make massive amounts of money.<br><br>"Alfie, is this&#x2014;"<br><br>"No! It is not some kind of joke. It is not a movie script. Madison, it's real. A woman was killed in <em>our</em> tunnel. Anyway, the crime scene units are there today, and Eddie Archer's closed the entire place. <em>No one</em> goes in until the police have finished with the tunnel, the security tapes, the studio&#x2014;you name it. Anyway, I was up last night when it all hit the news. And Eddie Archer looked white&#x2014;I mean, white as a ghost!&#x2014;when they showed him on film. He said he wants the police to have complete access to <em>everything</em> because he's going to find out what really happened&#x2014;his son is not a murderer!"<br><br>Alfie was telling the truth. As shocking as it was, she knew he was telling the truth.<br><br>Madison felt her heart break for Eddie Archer. He was such a good man.<br><br>Alistair was a good kid, too. Could he have snapped and killed someone?<br><br>No.<br><br>She couldn't accept that. He was too nice and decent, even shy.<br><br>"A monster," she repeated. "You mean&#x2014;the Egyptian priest, the killer from <em>Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum?"</em><br><br>"Exactly! Is that movie stuff or what? Everyone suspects <em>The Unholy</em> is a remake of that movie, but most people don't know for sure. And now, right in front of that tableau...a real murder! Anyway, I thought I'd call because if you show up at work, you'll be sent home. This way, you might be able to get some more sleep."<br><br>Madison wrinkled her face at the phone, as if she could convey her expression to Alfie. What? Go back to sleep <em>now?</em><br><br>"Thanks, Alfie. Thanks for letting me know. I'm sure I'll get tons of extra sleep."<br><br>"Keep me posted if you hear more," Alfie said. He seemed not to notice her sarcasm.<br><br>"Ditto," she said, and ended the call.<br><br>She crawled out of bed, drawing an indignant meow from Ichabod, curled up at the foot of the bed. "Sorry, my friend," she told the cat, hurrying out to the parlor of her old rented bungalow and switching on the TV, going from channel to channel until she found a news station covering the murder.<br><br>The information Alfie had given her was true. The news showed the crime tape blocking off the cinema and the studio, then cut to an earlier interview with Eddie Archer in front of the courthouse. He denied his son's culpability, and swore that he'd learn the truth behind the shocking murder.<br><br>Mike Greenwood, creative head of the studio and Madison's supervisor, stood beside him. When Eddie finished speaking, Mike stepped up to the microphone. He reasserted what Eddie had said, that the truth would be discovered and, while Alistair had been arraigned for the murder, the D.A.'s office had acted only on what <em>appeared</em> to be the case&#x2014;not what was. They would work toward his release, and by the middle or end of the week, when the police had gone over every inch of the place, Archer's Wizardry and Effects would be back in business. They would move forward with their various projects while the investigation continued. Mike spoke so earnestly, he silenced the spate of questions that should have arisen. He seemed concerned, but in control.<br><br>Mike was a steady man, excellent in stressful situations. Whenever they were on a tight deadline, Mike was the one who calmed down everyone at the studio, assuring them that, step by step, they'd get it all done.<br><br>Eddie had acted with his usual composure, but Madison felt so sorry for him.<br><br>Eddie, nearing fifty, was still fit, but his face bore the tension of sorrow. As Alfie had said, he looked white as a sheet. He'd run his fingers through his graying hair repeatedly as he spoke, his words calm but determined.<br><br>She was still staring at the TV in disbelief when her phone rang again. She'd left it in the bedroom, and raced to retrieve it, thinking it would be Mike Greenwood giving her the message that Alfie had already conveyed.<br><br>Her "Hello?" was breathless.<br><br>"Madison?"<br><br>The caller wasn't Mike Greenwood. It was Eddie Archer himself.<br><br>"Eddie!" she said. "Oh, Eddie, I'm so sorry."<br><br>"Then you've heard."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Alistair didn't do it."<br><br>"I believe that, Eddie. With my whole heart."<br><br>"Thank you." He was quiet.<br><br>"I heard not to come in, Eddie," Madison said. "Alfie called me."<br><br>"Actually, Madison, I do want you to come in. I have a friend arriving&#x2014;a film effects artist I worked with years ago. He's a member of the FBI now, and he's going to handle a special investigation for me. I'd like you to meet with him, show him around the studio."<br><br>"I&#x2014;I thought it was closed down, other than for the police?" FBI? How had he gotten the FBI involved? She wasn't savvy about law enforcement, but she'd always assumed the FBI only came in for serial killers or kidnapping or crimes that spanned several states.<br><br>And how the hell did a special-effects artist wind up in the FBI?<br><br><em>And, oh, God, why had Eddie chosen her?</em><br><br>She knew exactly why Eddie had chosen her. He'd never challenged her, he'd never forced her into a corner over this. But he believed&#x2014;had reason to believe&#x2014;that she talked to the dead.<br><br>"The police closed the Black Box Cinema. But <em>I</em> closed the studio. And Sean&#x2014;Sean Cameron&#x2014;won't be here until this afternoon. I just talked to him in the wee hours of the morning and he's coming from Virginia. I'm picking him up myself, so I'll swing by for you after I've collected him from LAX. If that's all right with you."<br><br>Madison exhaled on a long breath. The man she had hero-worshipped for his artistry throughout her formative years was asking for her help. The same man who'd hired her and opened up a world that she'd only dreamed of knowing.<br><br>"Eddie, I would do anything for you," she assured him humbly. "And for Alistair."<br><br>"Thank you. I think you're the right person to work with Sean. And I deeply appreciate your friendship&#x2014;for Alistair and me. You can expect me around five."<br><br>"Of course," she murmured lamely.<br><br>Eddie wasn't ready to hang up. "Alistair didn't do it&#x2014;he really didn't." He was quiet for a minute. "He told me that the Egyptian priest, Amun Mopat, came down from the <em>Sam Stone</em> tableau, and killed her. Alistair tried to reach Jenny, but slipped in the blood, conked himself out...and then came to and saw it was real&#x2014;he was lying in a pool of blood. I guess it's normal for the police to think that either he's crazy or his story is and that he's going to try for an insanity plea. But I know my son. I know he didn't do it. And only someone who's familiar with the studio can prove he didn't."<br><br>"We're in Hollywood&#x2014;a place filled with actors and effects," Madison said.<br><br>"Yeah," Eddie agreed, sounding bitter. "But, oddly enough, I believe we're the only ones who see the possibility that Alistair didn't do it. Anyway, Madison, I'll be by for you. If you're sure you don't mind."<br><br>"I'm happy to show your guy around the museum, Eddie."<br><br>Eddie Archer ended the call. Madison sank down into her art deco-style sofa, setting her phone on the coffee table in front of it.<br><br>"Hey."<br><br>Madison nearly leaped a mile into the air at the sound of the voice. Her hand fluttered to her throat; her heart thudded.<br><br>She turned and saw the man who'd spoken, standing just behind her.<br><br>The voice was soft. The man was slight, with dark graying hair and a wonderful face filled with character.<br><br>She let out a breath. Her sometime-resident "invisible" friend&#x2014;whether extension of her imagination or real ghost&#x2014;was seated on the arm of the sofa, looking at her sorrowfully.<br><br>"You all right, kid?"<br><br>She let out a breath, realizing that the very concept of someone being murdered where she worked was terrifying.<br><br>"Yeah. It would help if you didn't startle me like that."<br><br>"I spoke quietly. And I'm not exactly a surprise now, Madison, am I?"<br><br><em>No, not anymore.</em><br><br>She could see him plain as day, as if he were flesh and blood, a good friend who'd stopped by in a time of need. He had a fascinating, ruggedly masculine face&#x2014;including his slightly scarred lip&#x2014;and a lean, slight form. When he stood, he was on the short side at only five feet eight inches.<br><br>"Um, I'm fine. I'm just stunned," Madison said. Then she rushed into words, well aware of how ridiculous she'd look if anyone else was there&#x2014;because she saw Humphrey Bogart as he sat in her living room. "I don't know how much you hear or fathom from phone conversations, but there was a murder at the studio last night. A starlet who was with Alistair Archer. I can't believe he killed her. I <em>won't</em> believe it&#x2014;not Alistair. Eddie must be beside himself, desperate to help him. He's such a loving father."<br><br>"Watching a child suffer is a hard thing," Bogie said, his voice low and slightly nasal.<br><br>Bogie.<br><br>Madison stared at him. <em>Was</em> he an imaginary friend? She would never be sure. She'd had strange experiences as a child. She'd tried chalking them up to growing pains, teenage angst and, as her parents had suggested, an overactive imagination&#x2014;the kind that had led her right into a career. She'd also had experiences that had broken her heart&#x2014;and might be part of the reason she embraced her work, day in and day out.<br><br>Bogie hadn't come with the bungalow, though he'd lived there briefly in the 1920s. He'd told her once that he had loved it and loved living there. She'd first met him at the wax museum when she was a college student; she'd assumed he was a lookalike actor hired to play the part. They'd spoken and laughed together..<br><br>And he'd followed her home.<br><br>Bogie showed up whenever he wanted to. Apparently he had other places to haunt, as well. Madison simply accepted him as a friend&#x2014;imaginary though he might be. Sometimes she thought she was crazy; sometimes she thought she was incredibly lucky that such a man had chosen <em>her</em> to haunt. Although she believed that now, she hadn't always. He'd scared her to death at first, and had occasionally made her life hell.<br><br>He'd just startled her today; the first night she'd seen him sitting on her sofa, however, he'd practically given her a heart attack. She'd fumbled to call the police, and they'd come and almost arrested her, assuming she was another college kid trying to make trouble. Bogie had been apologetic and courteous&#x2014;so sorry for causing her distress. He was what he was, and he'd tried to explain, but she hadn't believed him.<br><br>Maybe he <em>was</em> imaginary, but she didn't know what part of her mind triggered his appearances.<br><br><em>And if he was, what about the other dead people who 'd spoken to her?</em><br><br>But imaginary or not, he was there for her now.<br><br>"Have some coffee, kid. That'll make you feel better."<br><br>"I'm not sure it will help me feel better. But at least it'll wake me up."<br><br>"What are you waking up for? You could go back to sleep."<br><br>"Why is it that everyone thinks I can sleep <em>now?"</em> she muttered.<br><br>Bogie ignored that, standing and stretching as he gazed out the windows. He turned to look at her. "The murder took place in the studio?" he asked.<br><br>She shook her head. "The underground tunnel between the Black Box Cinema and the studio&#x2014;where Archer has his film noir museum."<br><br>"Interesting," Bogie mused. "By which display?"<br><br>Madison frowned. "The news didn't say, but Alfie told me it was by the tableau for <em>Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.</em> Sounds crazy, doesn't it? I mean, especially since the studio is now in lockdown because of <em>The Unholy</em>&#x2014;the <em>Sam Stone</em> remake."<br><br></p><h2>The Land Beneath Us: (A Christian Historical Romance of the World War II Army Rangers) (Sunrise at Normandy)</h2><p>In 1943, Private Clay Paxton trains hard with the US Army Rangers at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, determined to do his best in the upcoming Allied invasion of France.

These culminated in What is Art?, published in 1898. Although Tolstoy perceived the question of art to be a religious one, he considered and rejected the idea that art reveals and reinvents through beauty. The works of Dante, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Baudelaire and even his own novels are condemned in the course of Tolstoy&#39;s impassioned and iconoclastic redefinition of art as a force for good, for the progress and improvement of mankind. In his illuminating preface Richard Pevear considers What is Art? in relation to the problems of faith and doubt, and the spiritual anguish and fear of death which preoccupied Tolstoy in the last decades of his life.</p><h2>Ethics Across the Professions: A Reader for Professional Ethics</h2><p>The most up-to-date professional ethics reader available, <em>Ethics Across the Professions: A Reader for Professional Ethics,</em> Second Edition, analyzes the complex ethical issues that arise in such fields as engineering, finance, healthcare, journalism, and law.

They didn't stay around very long but offered some choice bits of satirical nonsense while they did. As it happens, this volume is particularly rich in never-before-reprinted strips: over 150 (more than one fifth of the book!) have never seen the light of day since their original appearance over 40 years ago, so this will be a trove of undiscovered treasures even for avid <i>Peanuts</i> collectors. Introduced by Bill Melendez, animator of all the <i>Peanuts</i> TV specials starting all the way back with <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas!</i></p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.These 1963&#x2013;64 strips show Schulz continuing to mine high-grade humor and charm from his small cast and such concerns as Charlie Brown's inabilities to fly kites and procure Valentines, Linus' dependence on his security blanket, and Snoopy's obsession with the contents of his supper dish. Occasionally, something anomalous happens, such as a new kid in the neighborhood; named "5," he didn't stay long. Within a year, the Peanuts' fame would skyrocket with the debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas; animator Bill Melendez sketches the behind-the-scenes story of the show in this volume's introduction.

Residents can&#x2019;t wait for the restaurant openings, the cheese-tasting, and the bake-off, among other festivities. But there&#x2019;s nothing as tasty as a morsel of gossip, so when a mysterious woman moves into the New Pickax Hotel, the locals&#x2014;including Qwill&#x2014;indulge in lots of speculation. But then a bomb explodes in her room, killing the hotel housekeeper&#x2014;and now Qwill and his kitty sidekicks, Koko and Yum Yum, must put aside the fun and figure out who cooked up this murderous recipe...</p><p>It's autumn in the little town of Pickax, Moose County, and the citizens are preparing for a new event: the Great Food Explo. A philanthropic creation of the Klingenschoen Foundation (a.k.a. Jack Qwilleran), the Explo was arranged to bring new restaurants, inns, and food specialty shops to the area. The great event is only a week away when a bomb goes off in the only hotel in town, killing a housekeeper. Luckily for Pickax, Qwilleran and his two sleuthing felines, Koko and Yum Yum, are on the case. Thrown into the melee are several new characters, including a mysterious woman, a gentle beekeeper, and the woman who wins a date with Qwilleran at a celebrity auction--although cheese seems to be the main character. Find out what's going on in Moose County and read about some delicious tidbits while you're at it! <i>--Jhana Bach</i>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series.

They figured becoming acolytes was the best way to ease into the whole universe-saving thing. The two friends sat together on a musty old couch in a small New York City apartment. They were there to learn the mysterious ways of the acolytes. Not exactly dramatic surroundings, considering they were hearing words that would change their lives forever.<br><br>"You are the acolytes from Second Earth now," said Tom Dorney, whose apartment it was. "With Press gone, I'm no longer needed. It may be an easy job compared to what the Travelers do, but I think you'll agree it's an important one."<br><br>"We do. Absolutely. Yessir," Mark and Courtney assured him.<br><br>Dorney turned to look out his window and frowned. He was an old guy with short-cropped gray hair and excellent posture. He was once a soldier. Old habits die hard.<br><br>"Is there something you're not telling us?" Courtney asked.<br><br>Dorney sighed and said, "It's just a feeling."<br><br>"What?" she demanded.<br><br>"I don't know," Dorney said, troubled. "I didn't like what I heard about Veelox."<br><br>"Yeah, no kidding," Courtney said.<br><br>"What I mean to say is, be careful. Saint Dane has finally had a victory, and there's no telling what's next. From this point on, I can't guarantee that the old rules still apply."<br><br>This was chilling news for Mark and Courtney on their first official day as acolytes. Dorney's ominous warning was very much on their minds as they left his apartment and took the train back to Stony Brook, Connecticut. Just before the train pulled into Stony Brook Station, Mark announced, "I want to go to the flume."<br><br>"Why?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"We'll bring some of our clothes to leave there."<br><br>"But nobody told us they needed clothes," Courtney countered.<br><br>"I know. Just thinking ahead."<br><br>"That's just an excuse to go there, isn't it?" Courtney asked.<br><br>Mark didn't argue. "I guess I just want to see it again. To prove it's real."<br><br>"I hear you," Courtney said. "I do too."<br><br>When they got off the train, they both went home and gathered up a bunch of clothes they thought a Traveler from some distant territory might need on a visit to Second Earth. That's what acolytes did. They supported the Travelers on their mission to protect Halla. Courtney picked out a bunch of simple, functional things like jeans, T-shirts, a sweater, socks, hiking boots, and underwear. She debated about bringing one of her bras, but figured that was overkill. Mark gathered up a bunch of clothes that were totally out of style. It wasn't like he had a choice. That's all he had. He found sweatshirts with logos that meant nothing, no-name jeans, and generic sneakers. Style was not something Mark concerned himself with. He hoped the Travelers felt the same way.<br><br>Mark brought one extra item, but hoped he wouldn't need it. It was the sharp poker from his parents' fireplace. It was a woefully inadequate weapon to deal with an attacking quig-dog, but it was all he could find.<br><br>Shortly after, Mark and Courtney met at the iron gates in front of the empty Sherwood house. They silently walked around to the side and climbed the tree to get over the high stone wall that surrounded the spooky, abandoned estate. Once over, Mark held the fireplace poker out in front of him, ready to ward off a rampaging quig. Mark's hand was shaking like warm Jell-O, so Courtney gently took the weapon from him. If either of them had a chance of fighting off a charging quig, it would be Courtney.<br><br>Luckily they didn't run into any of the yellow-eyed beasts. They made it through the big empty mansion, down into the basement, and into the root cellar that held the newly created flume. No problem. They emptied their backpacks and neatly folded the clothes in a pile. Courtney looked at some of the geek clothes Mark brought, and chuckled.<br><br>"Oh yeah, Bobby's gonna blend right in wearing a bright yellow sweatshirt with a red logo that says, <i>'Cool Dude!'"</i><br><br>"Give me a break," Mark said defensively. "It's my favorite sweatshirt."<br><br>Courtney shook her head in disbelief. When they were finished, they both gazed into the dark tunnel to the territories. The flume. They stood together, each with his/her own thoughts as to what the future might hold.<br><br>"I'm scared and excited at the same time," Mark said.<br><br>"Really," Courtney added. "I want to be part of this, but it's scary not knowing what to expect."<br><br>"Can you imagine being a Traveler?" Mark asked while stepping into the mouth of the tunnel.<br><br>"Well, no," Courtney answered, "to be honest."<br><br>"Well, I've thought about it a lot!" Mark declared. "It would be awesome, stepping into a flume and announcing the next amazing place you'd like to go."<br><br>"It's pretty unbelievable," Courtney agreed.<br><br>"Look at this thing!" Mark said, scanning the flume. "It's kinda like having a jet fighter."<br><br>"It is?" Courtney asked with a chuckle.<br><br>"Yeah. You know what it's capable of, but have no idea what to do to make it go."<br><br>"It's not all that hard," Courtney said. "If you're a Traveler."<br><br>Mark smiled, turned to face the dark tunnel, and shouted out, <i>"Eelong!"</i><br><br>He looked back to Courtney and said, "Could you imagine if -- "<br><br>"Mark!" Courtney shouted.<br><br>Mark saw the terrified look on Courtney's face. She was looking past him, deeper into the flume. Mark spun quickly and saw something he thought was impossible.<br><br>The flume was coming to life.<br><br>Mark jumped out of the tunnel and ran to Courtney. The two backed away toward the far wall of the root cellar, hugging each other in fear.<br><br>"D-Did I do that?" Mark asked.<br><br>"Or is somebody coming?" Courtney added.<br><br>The light appeared from the depths of the tunnel. The musical notes were faint at first but quickly grew louder. The rocky walls began to crackle and groan. They had seen all this before, but only when the flume was activated by a Traveler. Never, ever had a flume been activated by a non-Traveler -- until now.<br><br>"I-I don't really want to go to Eelong," Mark cried. Courtney held him tighter, ready to hold him back if he got pulled in by the power of the flume.<br><br>The gray walls of the tunnel melted into glorious crystal as the bright light and sound arrived at the mouth. Mark and Courtney didn't dare put their hands in front of their eyes because they were too busy hanging on to each other. But neither felt the tug of the flume, because someone was headed their way. Through the bright light they saw a tall, dark silhouette appear and step out of the tunnel. Oddly, the sparkling light didn't go away. The jangle of music stayed too. This had never happened before, at least not that Mark or Courtney knew. But none of that mattered as much as the man who now stood facing them.<br><br>It was Saint Dane. He had arrived on Second Earth. The two had never seen him before, but there was no mistaking the tall demon with the long gray hair, piercing blue eyes, and dark clothes.<br><br>"And so it begins," Saint Dane cackled. "The walls are beginning to crack. The power that once was, will no longer be. It is a whole new game, with new rules."<br><br>Saint Dane roared out a laugh. With a sudden burst of light from deep inside the flume, his hair caught fire! His long gray mane exploded in flames, burning right down to his skull. Mark and Courtney watched in horror as the flames reflected in his demonic eyes. Saint Dane laughed the whole while, as if enjoying it.<br><br>Mark and Courtney didn't move, except to tremble.<br><br>The fire burned away all of Saint Dane's hair, leaving him completely bald, with angry red streaks that looked like inflamed veins running from the back of his head to his forehead. His eyes had changed too. The steely blue color had gone nearly white. He fixed those intense eyes on the two new acolytes and smiled. He tossed a dirty, cloth bag at their feet.<br><br>"A present for Pendragon," Saint Dane hissed. "Be sure he gets it, won't you?" Saint Dane took a step back into the light of the flume. "What was meant to be, is no longer," he announced. With that, he began to transform. His body turned liquid as he leaned over to put his hands on the ground. At the same time his body mutated into that of a huge, jungle cat. It was the size of a lion. His coat was brown, but speckled with black spots. The big cat snarled at Mark and Courtney, and leaped into the flume. An instant later the light swept him up and disappeared into the depths. The music faded, the crystal walls returned to stone, and the light shrank to a pin spot.<br><br>But it didn't disappear entirely.<br><br>Before Mark and Courtney could get their heads back together, the light began to grow again. The music became louder and the gray rock walls transformed back into crystal.<br><br>"My brain is exploding," Mark uttered.<br><br>A second later the bright light flashed at the mouth of the tunnel to deposit another passenger before returning to its normal, dormant state.<br><br>"Bobby!" Mark and Courtney shouted. They ran to him and threw their arms around him in fear and relief.<br><br>"What happened?" Bobby demanded, all business.<br><br>Mark and Courtney were both supercharged with adrenaline. "It was Saint Dane!" Courtney shouted. "His hair burned! It was horrible!"<br><br>"He said the rules have ch-changed, Bobby," Mark stuttered. "What did he m-mean?"<br><br>Bobby took a step back from them. Mark and Courtney sensed his tension.<br><br>"What did you do?" Bobby demanded. It sounded like he was scolding them.<br><br>"Do?" Courtney said. "We didn't do anything!"<br><br>Mark and Courtney focused on Bobby. He was wearing rags. His feet were bare, his hair was a mess, and he had a coating of dirt all over his body. He didn't smell so hot either.<br><br>"What happened to you?" Mark asked.<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Bobby shot back. He was just as charged up as they were. "Did you activate the flume?"<br><br>Mark and Courtney looked to each other. Mark said, "Uh, I g-guess so. I said 'Eelong' -- "<br><br>"No!" Bobby said in anguish.<br><br>"What's the matter?" Courtney asked. "We're not Travelers. We can't control the flume."<br><br>"Things have changed," Bobby shouted. "Saint Dane's power is growing. He's got his first territory. It's all about changing the nature of things."<br><br>"So...that means we can use the flumes?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"Don't!" Bobby demanded. "It'll just make things worse."<br><br>Mark remembered something. He ran back to the door of the root cellar and picked up the bag Saint Dane had thrown at them. "He said this was for you," Mark said, handing the bag to Bobby.<br><br>Bobby took it like it was the last thing in the world he wanted. He turned the rotten bag upside down, and something fell onto the floor. Courtney screamed. Mark took a step back in shock. Bobby stood firm, staring at the floor, his jaw muscles clenching. Lying at his feet was a human hand. It was large and dark skinned. As gruesome as this was, there was something else about it that made it nearly unbearable to look at. On one finger, was a Traveler ring.<br><br>"Gunny," Bobby whispered. It was the severed hand of the Traveler from First Earth, Vincent "Gunny" VanDyke. Bobby took a brave breath, picked up the hand, and jammed it into the bag.<br><br>"Bobby, what's happening?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"You'll know when I send my journal," he said. He turned back and ran into the mouth of the flume, clutching the bag with Gunny's hand in it. <i>"Eelong!"</i> he called out. The flume sprang back to life.<br><br>"Is Gunny all right?" Mark asked, nearly in tears.<br><br>"He's alive," Bobby said. "But I don't know for how long."<br><br>"Tell us what to do!" Courtney pleaded.<br><br>"Nothing," Bobby answered. "Wait for my journal. And whatever you do, do <i>not</i> activate the flume. That's exactly what Saint Dane wants. It's not the way things were meant to be."<br><br>With a final flash of light and jumble of notes, Bobby was swept into the flume, leaving his two friends alone to begin their careers as acolytes.<br><br>It wasn't a very good beginning.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by D.

It was originally intended as a manual for aspiring monks, a diverse group composed of serfs, scholars, shepherds, and sons of the nobility. St. Benedict's little book eventually developed into the preeminent monastic legislative code, a distinction it maintains to this day.<br>In addition to its importance in the organization and spread of Western monasticism, this volume also offers sound suggestions for readers outside the abbey. Benedict explores issues related to charity, personality, integrity, and spirituality. Mindful of human frailty, he counsels an ever-increasing self-discipline, supported by community worship. His teachings have guided readers from every walk of life for 1,500 years, encouraging and inspiring them with advice regarding the dignity of labor, the challenge of responsibility, and the proper use of resources.</p><p></p><h2>(ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide</h2><p><b>CISSP Study Guide -&nbsp; fully updated for the 2018 CISSP Body of Knowledge<br></b> <p><i>CISSP (ISC)2 Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8</i><i>th Edition</i>&nbsp;has been completely updated for the latest 2018 CISSP Body of Knowledge.

Her works are so incendiary in emotion and subject matter that one art critic suggested the walls of an exhibition be covered with asbestos. </p><p>In this beautiful book, art historian Hayden Herrera brings together numerous paintings and sketches by the amazing Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, documenting each with explanatory text that probes the influences in Kahlo&#x2019;s life and their meaning for her work. </p><p>Included among the illustrations are more than eighty full color paintings, as well as dozens of black and white pictures and line illustrations. Among the famous and little-known works included in <em>Frida Kahlo: The Paintings</em> are <em>The Two Fridas</em>,<em> Self Portrait as a Tehuana</em>,<em> Without Hope</em>,<em> The Dream, The Little Deer</em>,<em> Diego and I</em>,<em> Henry Ford Hospital</em>,<em> My Birth</em>, and <em>My Nurse and I</em>. Here, too, are documentary photographs of Frida Kahlo and her world that help to illuminate the various stages of her life. </p></p><p><p>Hayden Herrera is an art historian. She has lectured widely, curated several exhibitions of art, taught Latin American art at New York University, and has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. She is the author of numerous articles and reviews for such publications as <em>Art in America, Art Forum, Connoisseur,</em> and the <em>New York Times,</em> among others. Her books include <em>Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo; Mary Frank;</em> and <em>Matisse: A Portrait.</em> She is working on a critical biography of Arshile Gorky. She lives in New York City.</p>Frida Kahlo's extraordinary life and revolutionary art continue to bear fruit with two superb new books, coming quickly on the heels of Martha Zamora's acclaimed Frida Kahlo: The Brush of Anguish ( LJ 1/91). Lowe's biography, the first in a promising new series on women artists, is a succinct, insightful profile of the Mexican painter, combining a biographical chapter with an extended discussion of the self-portraits that make up the core of her oeuvre. Without becoming mired in florid language, Lowe cogently describes the biographical contexts of individual paintings and draws our attention to Kahlo's frequent employment of pre-Columbian symbolism. Lowe goes on to separate Kahlo's art from her biography in an extended analysis of the art historical setting within which she worked. This approach revitalizes the paintings, placing Kahlo's work in such explicitly Latin American traditions as retablo iconography and agitprop from the Left and also demonstrating the obsession of European Surrealists with "primitive" art. Herrera's ( Frida , LJ 1/83) beautifully produced book is laden with large color plates and dozens of photos of Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and their cronies. It improves upon Zamora by providing perhaps the most direct analysis of Kahlo's life and art within one volume to date. The two books are essential for any library without a Kahlo monograph, and for those having already purchased Zamora's biography, Lowe's economical paperback is an excellent supplementary text.<br><i>- Douglas F.

And yet, judging by the peals of laughter often heard coming out of Twelve Step meeting rooms, many eventually do find the humor in their self-defeating thoughts and actions.<br> <br><i>If You Leave Me, Can I Come with You?</i> is full of refreshingly original meditations for each day of the year. Infusing her wisdom with self-revealing honesty and humor, Misti B. provides healing insight with a lighthearted touch into the common struggles that codependents and those in Al-Anon frequently face. Issues such as people pleasing, lack of boundaries, and perfectionism don&#x2019;t have to overwhelm us if we work a solid Twelve Step program and learn not to take ourselves so seriously. Misti B. shows how to do both, delivering the right mix of support, inspiration, and healthy irreverence.</p><p><b>Introduction:</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Let's face it, Al-Anons aren't especially known for our humor.

My mother would say, grabbing the plate out of my hand, "You look full.

When someone's pulling turkey dinner out of your hands you learn to move fast and make decisions.

The downside was, I was plotting my escape while other kids were, I dunno, eating Christmas dinner and having fun. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Recovery was hard for me. I couldn't control it or speed it up. I still can't, and I don't like it. But I'm learning to trust my Higher Power. Even when everyone else is going nuts, I might need to just take it easy. Sometimes that means sitting quietly and waiting for answers, at other times, it means trusting my gut and taking action.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Even if everybody is moving at warped speed, I don't have to join in. I can relish the holidays in my way, at my pace, no matter what other people's agendas are.

This journey of exile became known as the Trail of Tears. <br><br> Historians Perdue and Green reveal the government?s betrayals and the divisions within the Cherokee Nation, follow the exiles along the Trail of Tears, and chronicle the hardships found in the West. In its trauma and tragedy, the Cherokee diaspora has come to represent the irreparable injustice done to Native Americans in the name of nation building?and in their determined survival, it represents the resilience of the Native American spirit.</p><p><b>Theda Perdue</b> is the professor emerita within the history department at University of North Carolina&nbsp;at Chapel Hill.

The Indian Removal Act (1830) fixed in law a revolutionary program of political and social engineering that caused unimaginable suffering, deaths in the thousands, and emotional pain that lingers to this day. It's a tangled tale of partisan politics and Cherokee power struggles, of juridical argument and economic motive, of bitter personal disputes and changing public policy. Perdue (<i>Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southeast</i>) and Green (<i>The Cherokee Removal</i>) have written a lucid, readable account of the legal complexities of the 18th-century right of conquest doctrine and the 19th-century emerging doctrine of state rights; the treaties, alliances, obligations and assurances involved; and the landmark cases <i>Cherokee</i> v. <i>Georgia</i> and <i>Worcester </i>v. <i>Georgia</i> (one effectively denying Cherokee self-government, one ineffectively affirming Cherokee sovereignty). Over it all hangs the disquieting knowledge that in the history of interaction between Euro-Americans and Indians, Cherokee removal [exemplifies] a larger history that no one should forget. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you're in a big truck, they're around you like gnats. They're at their worst in the on-ramps of limited-access highways, not to mention what they do on horse-and-buggy highways. They do the kissing tailgate. They do passing moves over double yellow lines. They make last-second break-ins from stop signs on feeder roads. The way they are operated suggests insufficiency in, among other things, co�rdination, depth perception, and rhythm. When I went to bad-driver school, the opening lecturer did not imply any such flaws in his students. He was a real bear. He wore blue-and-yellow trousers and a badge. In a voice he fired like a .45, he began by asking us, "How many of you people think you're good drivers?" <br>&nbsp; <br>We had all been singled out in four-wheelers. My own car had a tendency to ignore stop signs without previously sensing the presence of bears. It lapsed in other ways as well. After I reached twelve points, I was offered admission to the New Jersey Driver Improvement Program, on the following voluntary basis: enroll or lose your license. Among the twenty-five people in the class, two smart-asses stuck up their hands in positive response to the instructor's question. He looked them over, then swept the room. "Well, you must all be good drivers," he said. "If you weren't, you'd be dead." <br>&nbsp; <br>Then he darkened the room and rolled a film showing cars hitting cars in on-ramps. A, looking left, accelerates. B, looking left, accelerates. B rear-ends A, because A hesitated, and B was still looking to the left. This primal accident, the figure eight of bad driving, was the base of a graphic montage that ended in high-speed collision and hideous death on the road. <br>&nbsp; <br>These memories of bad-driver school ran through me in eastern Oregon after Don Ainsworth, at the wheel of his sixty-five-foot chemical tanker, gave some air horn to a step van that was coming fast up an on-ramp on a vector primed for a crash. A step van is a walk-in vehicle of the UPS variety, and, like all other four-wheelers, from Jettas to Jaguars, in Ainsworth's perspective is not a truck. FedEx, Wonder Bread, Soprano Sand-and-Gravel--they're not trucks, they're four-wheelers, even if they have six wheels. A true truck has eighteen wheels, or more. From Atlanta and Charlotte to North Powder, Oregon, this was the first time that Ainsworth had so much as tapped his air horn. In the three thousand one hundred and ninety miles I rode with him he used it four times. He gave it a light, muted blast to thank a woman in a four-wheeler who helped us make a turn in urban traffic close to our destination, and he used it twice in the Yakima Valley, flirting with a woman who was wearing a bikini. She passed us on I-82, and must have pulled over somewhere, because she passed us again on I-90. She waved both times the horn erupted. She was riding in a convertible and her top was down. <br>&nbsp; <br>If the step van had hit us it would only have been inconvenient, the fact notwithstanding that we were hauling hazmats. The step van weighed about ten thousand pounds and we weighed eighty thousand pounds, minus a few ounces. Ainsworth said he could teach a course called On-Ramp 101. "We get many near-misses from folks who can't time their entry. They give you the finger. Women even give you the finger. Can you believe it?" <br>&nbsp; <br>I could believe it. <br>&nbsp; <br>"Four-wheelers will pass us and then pull in real fast and put on their brakes for no apparent reason," he said. "Four-wheelers are not aware of the danger of big trucks. They're not aware of the weight, of how long it takes to bring one to a halt, how quickly their life can be snuffed. If you pull any stunts around the big trucks, you're likely to die. I'm not going to die. You are." <br>&nbsp; <br>We happened to be approaching Deadman Pass. We were crossing the Blue Mountains--on I-84, the Oregon Trail. He said, "Before you know it, we'll be sitting on top of Cabbage. Then we're going to fall down." He had mentioned Cabbage Hill when we were still in the Great Divide Basin. He mentioned it again in Pocatello. After crossing into Oregon and drawing closer, he brought it up twice an hour. "It's the terrific hill we fall down before we come to Pendleton. Pretty treacherous. Switchbacks. Speed restricted by weight. You'll see guys all the time with smoke flying out the brakes or even a flameout at the bottom." <br>&nbsp; <br>From the Carolina piedmont to Hot Lake, Oregon--across the Appalachians, across the Rockies--he had not put his foot on the brake pedal on any descending grade. In harmony with shrewd gear selection, this feat was made possible by Jake Brakes--a product of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, of Bloomfield, Connecticut. Ainsworth called the device "a retarder, generically--you're turning a diesel engine into an air compressor." On a grade we descended in Tennessee, he said, "If you choose your gear right, and your jake's on maxi, you can go down a hill with no brakes. It saves money. It also lengthens my life." Crossing the summit of the Laramie Range and addressing the western side, he geared down from twelfth to eighth and said, "I won't use one ounce of brake pressure. The jake is on maxi." As big trucks flew past us--dry boxes, reefers--he said, "These guys using brakes with improper gear selection don't own the tractor or the trailer. Using brakes costs money, but why would they care?" Ainsworth owns the tractor and the trailer. As he glided onto the Laramie Plains, he went back up to eighteenth gear: "the going- home gear, the smoke hole; when you got into this gear in the old days, your stacks would blow smoke." On a grade at Hot Lake, however, he tried fifteenth gear, and his foot had to graze the pedal. He seemed annoyed with himself, like a professional golfer who had chosen the wrong club. <br>&nbsp; <br>And now we were about to "fall down Cabbage." In ten miles, we would drop two thousand feet, six of those miles on a six-per-cent grade. Through basaltic throughcuts we approached the brink. A sign listed speed limits by weight. If you weighed sixty thousand to sixty-five thousand pounds, your limit was thirty-seven miles an hour. In five-thousand-pound increments, speed limits went down to twenty-six and twenty-two. Any vehicle weighing seventy-five thousand pounds or more--e.g., this chemical tanker--was to go eighteen or under. A huge high view with Pendleton in it suddenly opened up. I had asked Ainsworth what makes a tractor-trailer jackknife. He had said, "You're going downhill. The trailer is going faster than the tractor. The trailer takes over. It's almost impossible to bring yourself out of it. Brakes won't do anything for you. It's a product of going too fast for the situation. It can happen on a flat highway, but nine times out of ten it's downhill." The escarpment was so steep that the median widened from a few feet to one and a half miles as the northbound and southbound lanes negotiated independent passage. Ainsworth had chosen eighth gear. He said, "Most truckers would consider this way too conservative. That doesn't mean they're bright." Oregon is the only American state in which trucks are speed-restricted by weight. Feet off both pedals, he started the fall down Cabbage praising the truck for "good jake" and himself for "nice gear selection." My ears thickened and popped. <br>&nbsp; <br>"Six per cent is serious," he said. "I've seen some sevens or eights. British Columbia drivers talk about tens and twelves." <br>&nbsp; <br>In two strategic places among the broad looping switchbacks were escape ramps, also known as arrester beds, where a brakeless runaway truck--its driver "mashing the brake pedal and it feels like a marshmallow"--could leave the road and plow up a very steep incline on soft sandy gravel. In winter, the gravel may not be soft. Ainsworth recalled a trucker in Idaho who hit a frozen ramp. His load, bursting through from behind, removed his head. On Cabbage Hill, deep fresh tracks went up an arrester bed several hundred feet. After trucks use a bed, it has to be re- groomed. The state charges grooming fees. Some drivers, brakeless and out of control, stay on the highway and keep on plunging because they don't want to pay the grooming fees. Ainsworth said, "Would you worry about your life or the God- damned grooming fee?" <br>&nbsp; <br>He was asking the wrong person. <br>&nbsp; <br>A little later, he said, "Bears will roost at the bottom here." <br>&nbsp; <br>Fulfilling the prediction, two cars were in ambush in the median where the grade met the plain. Wheat fields filled the plain--endless leagues of wheat, big combines moving through the wheat, houses far out in the wheat concealed within capsules of trees. We passed a couple of dry boxes, both of them Freightliners. Among truckers, they are also known as Freightshakers. "What's the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door on a Freightliner?" Ainsworth said. <br>&nbsp; <br>I said I didn't happen to know. <br>&nbsp; <br>He said, "You can close a door on a Jehovah's Witness." <br>&nbsp; <br>We crossed the Columbia River and went over the Horse Heaven Hills into the Yakima Valley, apples and grapes in the Horse Heaven Hills, gators in the valley. To avoid a gator he swung far right, over rumble bars along the shoulder. A gator is a strip of tire, dead on the road, nearly always a piece of a recap. "A gator can rip off your fuel-crossover line, punch in your bumper, bomb out a fender." <br>&nbsp; <br>The Yakima River was deeply incised and ran in white water past vineyards and fruit trees, among windbreaks of Lombardy poplars. Hops were growing on tall poles and dangling like leis. There was so much beauty in the wide valley it could have been in Italy. Now, through high haze, we first saw the Cascades. On our route so far, no mountain range had been nearly as impressive. We had slithered over the R...</p><h2>A Short World History of Christianity, Revised Edition</h2><p><p>Church historians have long known and appreciated Christianity's global history. Until recently, however, introductory textbooks on the history of Christianity focused almost exclusively on Europe and North America. Robert Bruce Mullins's A Short World History of Christianity, by contrast, offers a panoramic picture of the history of Christianity in its Western and non-Western expressions. It tells the story of the early church in the Greek East as well as the Latin West; of Christianity's spread into Asia as well as Europe during the Middle Ages; and its explosion around the world during the modern period. Mullins's highly readable narrative explores why global perspectives have emerged so strongly in our understanding of the story of Christianity and how they have impacted Christianity's perspective on its place in the world. </p><p>This newly revised edition adds information on such global phenomena as early Syriac-speaking Christianity; the growth of Pentecostalism around the world, especially in the southern hemisphere; and recent trends in Christianity, including the elevation of the first pope born in the Americas. A time line of key dates, call-out boxes, and other helpful study materials are also provided. Beginning students will appreciate this memorable introduction to the most important events in the history and development of Christianity.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Bruce Mullin</b> is Society for the Promotion of Religion and Learning Professor of History and World Mission and Professor of Modern Anglican Studies at General Theological Seminary in New York City. He is the author of numerous books and articles.</p>'To this day, reading good narrative history is a never-failing pleasure. History, that is, like Robert Bruce Mullin's A Short World History of Christianity. It is no easy business, getting two millennia of Christian history into 283 readable pages. But Professor Mullin has done the job, in a readable style that makes the fruits of his impressive ample scholarship available to a general audience.' --George Weigel, Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center<br><br>This book should be welcomed by all who value clear writing, careful scholarship, succinct reporting, and carefully weighed judgments. If measured by standards of comprehensiveness or of answering every question in the long history of Christianity correctly, this book, like all others, must fail. But if measured by its success at portraying that history from below as well as from above, providing significant treatment of the Southern hemisphere along with the West, and incorporating the stories of many denominational families in a single account, then this book must be judged a resounding success. --Mark A. Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor, History Department, University of Notre Dame<br><br>This readable history reflects the sure instincts of a master teacher. Bruce Mullin s text integrates the theological and social dimensions of Christian history, providing readers with a masterful guide to the subject for many years to come. --Dana L.

Another bolt lit our carriage with bright white clarity before rendering us temporarily deaf with a clap of thunder so loud the windows threatened to loosen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How can you laugh?&#x201d; Justine asked. I had not realized I was laughing until that moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stroked her dark hair where strands dangled free from her hat. Justine hated loud noises of any type: Slamming doors. Storms. Shouting. Especially shouting. But I had made certain she had endured none of that in the past two years. It was so odd that our separate origins--similar in cruelty, though differing in duration--had had such opposite outcomes. Justine was the most open and loving and genuinely good person I had ever known.<br> &nbsp;<br> And I was--<br> &nbsp;<br> Well. Not like her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did I ever tell you Victor and I used to climb out onto the roof of the house to watch lightning storms?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head, not lifting it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The way the lighting would play off the mountains, throwing them into sharp relief, as though we were watching the creation of the world itself. Or over the lake, so it looked like it was in both the sky and the water. We would be soaked by the end; it is a wonder neither of us caught our death.&#x201d; I laughed again, remembering. My skin--fair like my hair--would turn the most violent shades of red from the cold. Victor, with his dark curls plastered to his sallow forehead, accentuating the shadows he always bore beneath his eyes, would look like death. What a pair we were!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One night,&#x201d; I continued, sensing Justine was calming, &#x201c;lightning struck a tree on the grounds not ten body lengths from where we sat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That must have been terrifying!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was glorious.&#x201d; I smiled, placing my hand flat against the cold glass, feeling the temperature beneath my lacy white gloves. &#x201c;To me, it was the great and terrible power of nature. It was like seeing God.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Justine clucked disapprovingly, peeling herself from my side to give me a stern look. &#x201c;Do not blaspheme.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stuck my tongue out at her until she relented into a smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did Victor think of it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, he was horribly depressed for months afterward. I believe his exact phrasing was that he &#x2018;languished in valleys of incomprehensible despair.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Justine&#x2019;s smile grew, though with a puzzled edge. Her face was clearer than any of Victor&#x2019;s texts. His books always required further knowledge and intense study, while Justine was an illuminated manuscript--beautiful and treasured and instantly understandable.<br> &nbsp;<br> I reluctantly pulled the curtains closed on the carriage window, sealing us away from the storm for her comfort. She had not left the house at the lake since our last disastrous trip into Geneva had ended with her insane, bereft mother attacking us. This journey into Bavaria was taxing for her. &#x201c;While I saw the destruction of the tree as nature&#x2019;s beauty, Victor saw power--power to light up the night and banish darkness, power to end a centuries-old life in a single strike--that he cannot control or access. And nothing bothers Victor more than something he cannot control.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wish I had known him better before he left for university.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I patted her hand--her brown leather gloves a gift Henry had given me--before squeezing her fingers. Those gloves were far softer and warmer than my own. But Victor preferred me in white. And I loved giving nice things to Justine. She had joined the household two years earlier, when she was seventeen and I was fifteen, and had been there only a couple of months before Victor left us. She did not really know him.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one did, except me. I liked it that way, but I wanted them to love each other as I loved them both.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Soon you will know Victor. We shall all of us--Victor and you and me--&#x201d; I paused, my tongue traitorously trying to add Henry. That was not going to happen. &#x201c;We will be reunited most joyfully, and then my heart will be complete.&#x201d; My tone was cheery to mask the fear that underlay this entire endeavor.<br> &nbsp;<br> I could not let Justine be worried. Her willingness to come as my chaperone was the only reason I had managed this trip. Judge Frankenstein had initially rejected my pleadings to check on Victor. I think he was relieved to have Victor gone, did not care when we had no word. Judge Frankenstein always said Victor would come home when he was ready, and I should not worry about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I did. Very much. Particularly after I found a list of expenses with my name at the top. He was auditing me--and soon, I had no doubt, he would determine that I was not worth holding on to. I had done too well, fixing Victor. He was out in the world, and I was obsolete to his father.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would not let myself be cast out. Not after my years of hard work. Not after all I had done.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, Judge Frankenstein had been called away on a mysterious journey of his own. I did not ask permission again so much as . . . leave. Justine did not know that. Her presence gave me the freedom I needed here to move about without inviting suspicion or censure. William and Ernest, Victor&#x2019;s younger brothers and her charges, would be fine in the care of the maid until we could return.<br><br></p></p><h2>Ravished: A Novel</h2><p>From the cozy confines of a tiny seaside village to the glittering crush of the a fashionable London soiree comes an enthralling tale of a thoroughly mismatched couple . . . poised to discover the rapture of love.<br><br>There was no doubt about it.

The building was the administrative nerve center for Israel Defense Forces units operating in the area, and it housed two companies of Border Guard policemen as well. The Border Guards, Israel's paramilitary police arm, were in Lebanon to maintain law and order in the towns and villages of southern Lebanon. The policemen represented the mosaic of Israeli society and included Jews, Druzes, Bedouins, and Circassians. Many of the Border Guard personnel spoke Arabic, and many had spent careers policing a hostile population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The building was more than just a military garrison. The Tyre facility was the Israeli intelligence hub in southern Lebanon. A'man, Israeli military intelligence, ran many of its human intelligence (HUMINT) operations. Handlers from the ultrasecretive Unit 504, the military intelligence unit that ran agents behind enemy lines, used the regional headquarters as a safe and comfortable location where assets could be debriefed and espionage endeavors coordinated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Shin Bet, Israel's domestic counterintelligence and counterterrorist agency, was also based inside the building. The Shin Bet was responsible for all counterterrorist investigations in southern Lebanon and for rounding up the last vestiges of Arafat's legions in southern Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Business was booming for the Shin Bet. The basement holding cells were full of Lebanese and Palestinian men suspected of belonging to one popular front or another. The detained were often a remarkable source of information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the men serving inside the headquarters building were reservists-from Israel's citizen army, doing their annual thirty-day stint of call-up service. The reservists were a mixture of middle-aged men happy to have a few weeks away from wives and kids, and men young enough still to be in school, still trying to save enough to get married, and still holding on to dreams of lives out of uniform. Captain Dubi Eichnold, the commander of the Military Police investigative unit at the base, was preparing a small party for some of the officers that evening, November 11, 1982; it was to be a celebration to mark the halfway point of the reservist stint for him and his team. A small feast, including snacks and soft drinks, was being readied for the party. Everyone was itching to go home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Captain Eichnold was already sitting with a few of his fellow officers in the mess hall at 7:00 that Thursday morning. The officers were in full kit, battle rattle at their sides. An electric space heater failed to mitigate the bone-numbing cold and the officers wore their olive green winter parkas as they guzzled cup after cup of army-issue rocket-fuel-grade coffee. Upstairs, the Border Guard's morning garrison was getting ready for morning roll call. Downstairs, the prisoners in the holding cell had already eaten. Some were in the middle of morning prayers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The military policeman standing guard outside next to a small embankment of sand bags could hear the clanking of metal forks scraping plastic plates and he smelled the eggs cooking. He hoped that someone would bring him a cup of coffee soon. A white Peugeot 504 appeared from the west, speeding toward the headquarters building. The rain had intensified. The sky darkened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At 7:15 on the morning of November 11, 1982, the Israeli military headquarters in Tyre collapsed in a blinding flash of light, the seven stories reduced to rubble beneath a rising plume of black smoke. At the time, more than a hundred Israeli soldiers, policemen, and spies had been inside the building; many of those not killed instantly became trapped inside tiny air pockets, their bodies bloodied by the explosion and debris. The Israel Defense Forces had little experience in pulling survivors out of a building hit by a catastrophic blast-there had never been a need; a terrorist might throw a hand grenade into a crowded cinema, but he didn�t demolish a building. Rescues were done painstakingly by hand. Combat engineers were flown in, and helicopters shuttled the wounded to awaiting trauma care thirty-five miles away at the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. The dead were removed, the shattered bodies covered with coarse, olive-colored blankets. Rain created puddles that formed cement-like patches of caked-together blood and dust. By nightfall, the magnitude of the calamity was apparent: sixty-seven IDF and Border Guard personnel were dead, along with nine Shin Bet agents and fifteen local detainees. November 11, 1982, was one of the deadliest days in Israeli military history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Few understood it yet, but the attack represented a new struggle for Lebanon's soul-and one that would be pursued with a new tactic, suicide bombing. The man responsible for the destruction wasn't even a man yet. Ahmed Qasir was a fifteen-year-old boy when he drove the explosive-laden Peugeot 504 that destroyed the Israeli military headquarters. He had lived an unexceptional existence in the Shiite village of Dir Qanoun an-Nahr, located in the foothills ten miles north of Tyre-a setting more akin to the last century but beset by the horrors of twentieth-century destruction. He attended the local mosque, but left school after the fifth grade to work at his father's vegetable stall in the village market. According to reports, Ahmed was never a shooter-someone who took up arms against the Palestinians or the Israelis-but he did associate with local young men who carried their AK-47s openly, and he began to embrace the Khomeini-brand fanaticism-laced Shiite Islam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Young and impressionable, Ahmed Qasir was obviously infatuated by the powerful and indomitable men in camouflage fatigues and Ray-Ban sunglasses. He felt a sense of pride and privilege being in their company, and a sense of duty when they asked him to carry out small-scale reconnaissance sorties in and around Beirut, smuggling armaments and monitoring the movements of Israeli patrols. Qasir soon began to borrow his father's truck for daylong assignments. He never had a driver's license and his feet barely reached the pedals. His father never knew where he was going, or what he was doing. On the morning of November 11, Qasir disappeared-never to be heard from again. His parents were certain that he had been kidnapped-possibly killed-by Christian militiamen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Qasir's martyrdom should have been celebrated in Dir Qanoun an-Nahr. The old women of the village would have brought pots of food; the men, including village elders and the local imam, would have been huddled in the living room, drinking sweet tea with mint leaves and chain-smoking cigarettes while proudly gazing at a framed portrait of Ahmed Qasir displayed on a chair with red velvet cushions. But the notion of the boy's martyrdom had yet to be publicly revealed. The men who sent Ahmed Qasir on his mission, the men who purchased the Peugeot and wired it with explosives-including several members of Syrian intelligence and a few senior men who spoke Farsi-were able to convince the teenager that by blowing himself up, he would be reenacting the sacrifice of Imam Hussein, the core of the Shiite faith, and that as a result he would secure his spot in paradise. Yet the facilitators of this new brand of terror wanted to keep the Tyre operation a secret. Ahmed's parents wouldn't learn of their son's fate until two and a half years later, when a shrine to the martyr was built in Ba'albek. They did not know what would have motivated the youngster to perpetrate such an act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tehran's emissaries tasked with introducing to Lebanon the cult of the suicide bomber, a tactic that had become a common weapon in the Iran-Iraq War, were determined to redraw the map of the Middle East, a region engulfed in the flames of fundamentalist Islamic fervor. Ahmed Qasir would be the first of what was to be a legion of martyrs fighting both Israel and the United States. November 11, 1982, would be known as the Day of Martyrs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There weren�t supposed to be any martyrs, of course. Israel had never intended to be at war with Lebanon�s Shiites. On the morning of June 6, 1982, five months before the attack on the HQ in Tyre, sixty thousand Israeli troops crossed into Lebanon in a three-pronged invasion to remove the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure that threatened the residents of northern Israel. The objective of the incursion, claimed Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon, was to push Palestinian forces twenty-five miles to the north of the Israeli frontier. The Israeli operation was dubbed �Peace for Galilee.�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The war had erupted like many Middle Eastern bloodbaths-with a spark: pro-Iraqi terrorists from the Abu Nidal faction shot and almost killed Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to London. In retaliation, Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian terror targets throughout Lebanon; the Palestinians then launched rocket barrages against the towns and cities of Israel's north. The war to secure Galilee commenced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The assassination attempt on the ambassador in London was nothing more than a pretext. For years Israeli intelligence had been working with Lebanon's Maronite Christians to initiate a new regime in Beirut that would rid the country of the Palestinian terrorist presence and launch a new Jewish-Christian alliance to reshape the Middle East for generations. And now, with bullets fired by an Abu Nidal gunman, Israel had the instigation it needed to invade Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Full-scale wars in the Middle East never ended the way the politicians and generals intended. Syria's president Hafez al-Assad considered Lebanon to be a province of Greater Syria, and had permanently garrisoned thirty thousand of his troops inside the country. During Lebanon's civil war, the Syrians had protected their interests with brutal and cunning force, intervening to help the Palestinians and the Christians when Syrian concerns were threatened. Now war in Lebanon meant that Israel and Syria would engage in open conflict.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign was hard fought and bloody, yet the Israel Defense Forces advanced quickly and decisively. Palestinian forces that stood to fight were overwhelmed by the mechanized might of the Israeli military; Syrian forces-even with the latest and greatest armor, missile systems, and aircraft that the Soviet Union could provide-proved no match for Israel's technological superiority. The Syrians were humbled in open warfare, and the Israelis reached the outskirts of Beirut in a matter of weeks. In the attempt to rid the country once and for all of the armed Palestinian presence, the IDF laid siege to Beirut, trapping some fourteen thousand of Arafat's men in the western-Muslim-half of the city. American-led international diplomacy worked out a deal wherein international peacekeepers-Italian naval infantrymen, French paratroopers, and US marines-secured the evacuation of Palestinian forces from Beirut. The heavily armed Palestinians were forced to board ships destined for Algeria, Tunisia, Iraq, Yemen, and the Sudan. Israeli officers looked on from the hills above the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On August 23, 1982, Bashir Gemayel, the military commander and political leader of the Lebanese Phalange Party, was elected the country's new president. Even though he was the only candidate, Gemayel's election gave many in the West high hopes for Lebanon. Perhaps, American and European diplomats wished, the Lebanese people would be offered a brief respite from the endless cycle of violence. The international peacekeepers withdrew from Beirut on September 10, having completed their mission efficiently, and without incident or casualty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope can be a fleeting currency in the Middle East-especially in a nation repeatedly torn apart by religious enmity and outside manipulation. No plan, no matter how cunning or virtuous, ever works in the Middle East without an insurmountable toll of bodies and generations' worth of misery that would have to be avenged. Israel's grand scheme for its troubled northern neighbor soon imploded with extensive-and unstoppable-collateral damage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On September 14, the Lebanese president-elect was in the middle of an address to followers in his Beirut headquarters when the room-along with much of the building-was decimated by nearly a quarter ton of high explosives. Three weeks after his election, Bashir Gemayel was dead. A Christian operative working at the behest of Syrian intelligence agents had placed the bomb in an apartment directly above the central meeting hall where Gemayel was speaking. The blast, as one Christian woman would later state, did not kill a man but murdered a country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rumors soon spread that the Palestinians had been responsible for Gemayel's murder, and rumors were enough to sound calls for vengeance. Retribution came fast and with untold carnage. Christian militiamen from Beirut and southern Lebanon converged on the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps and in two days of butchery killed between 760 and 3,500 men, women, and children in cold blood. The international peacekeepers, still on ships off the Lebanese coast, were forced to return to Beirut, this time to protect the Palestinian and Muslim residents and to try-impossibly-to initiate law and order in a city that had seen neither since civil war had erupted seven years earlier. US marines were responsible for the southern tip of Beirut, including the international airport and the Shiite slums; the French and Italians patrolled West Beirut. Israeli forces, faced with the onset of an inescapable quagmire, withdrew to the hills outside the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For several years the United States had feared that the situation in Lebanon could easily escalate into a full-scale Arab-Israeli war. War had nearly broken out in April 1981 when the Syrian military introduced Soviet-made surface-to-air batteries into Lebanon's Beka'a Valley; only tense shuttle diplomacy, spearheaded by US special envoy Philip Habib, stopped Israel from responding militarily. When Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982, the Reagan administration was divided on the war. Some, such as Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the former commander of NATO, understood that the conflict in Lebanon was an extension of the Cold War-Israel was a client of the West, while both Syria and Palestine were allies of the Warsaw Pact-and he supported Israel's push to eradicate the Palestinian terrorist base in Lebanon, as well as to rid the area of the Syrian military. Others, like Vice President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, pressed President Reagan to force the Israelis to halt their offensive and to impose sanctions if they didn...</p></p><h2>Working Papers, Chapters 1-17 for Gilbertson/Lehman/Gentene&#39;s Century 21 Accounting: General Journal, 10th</h2><p>Printed Working Papers help you efficiently complete end-of-lesson, end of-chapter, and reinforcement activities, as well as improved chapter study guides.</p><p>Claudia B.

When Mayo stepped inside and put a hand on the telegraph key, he had no way of knowing the course of his life would change forever&#x2014;and that he would become entangled with a band of Civil War veterans with a score to settle against the government...and a feisty young woman who&#x2019;d risk anything to save the people she loved.

Donovan.</b><br> <br>Originally published in 1964, this is the &#x201c;enthralling...truly remarkable&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) insider account of the Cold War spy exchange&#x2014;with a new foreword by Jason Matthews, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Red Sparrow</i> and <i>Palace of Treason</i>.<br><br>In the early morning of February 10, 1962, James B. Donovan began his walk toward the center of the Glienicke Bridge, the famous &#x201c;Bridge of Spies&#x201d; which then linked West Berlin to East. With him, walked Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, master spy and for years the chief of Soviet espionage in the United States. Approaching them from the other side, under equally heavy guard, was Francis Gary Powers, the American U-2 spy plane pilot famously shot down by the Soviets, whose exchange for Abel Donovan had negotiated. These were the strangers on a bridge, men of East and West, representatives of two opposed worlds meeting in a moment of high drama.<br> <br> Abel was the most gifted, the most mysterious, the most effective spy in his time. His trial, which began in a Brooklyn United States District Court and ended in the Supreme Court of the United States, chillingly revealed the methods and successes of Soviet espionage.<br> <br> No one was better equipped to tell the whole absorbing history than James B. Donovan, who was appointed to defend one of his country&#x2019;s enemies and did so with scrupulous skill. In <i>Strangers on a Bridge</i>, the lead prosecutor in the Nuremburg Trials offers a clear-eyed and fast-paced memoir that is part procedural drama, part dark character study and reads like a noirish espionage thriller. From the first interview with Abel to the exchange on the bridge in Berlin&#x2014;and featuring unseen photographs of Donovan and Abel as well as trial notes and sketches drawn from Abel&#x2019;s prison cell&#x2014;here is an important historical narrative that is &#x201c;as fascinating as it is exciting&#x201d; (<i>The Houston Chronicle</i>).</p><p>Born in New York City in 1916, James B. Donovan graduated from Fordham University and Harvard Law School. A commander in the Navy during World War II, he became general counsel of the Office of Strategic Services and was associate prosecutor at the principal Nuremberg trial. Mr. Donovan subsequently acted as chief counsel in major trials and appeals in over thirty states, and was an insurance lawyer and partner at Watters and Donovan. He was Democratic candidate for United States Senator from New York in 1962; served as general counsel for the Cuban Families Committee, obtaining the release of more than 9,700 Cubans and Americans from Castro&#x2019;s Cuba; was president of Pratt Institute; and was president of the Board of Education of the City of New York.

Historians treat him as the archenemy of progress, a ruthless aristocrat who used his power as the dominant European statesman of the first half of the nineteenth century to stifle liberalism, suppress national independence, and oppose the dreams of social change that inspired the revolutionaries of 1848. Wolfram Siemann paints a fundamentally new image of the man who shaped Europe for over four decades. He reveals Metternich as more modern and his career much more forward-looking than we have ever recognized.</p><p>Clemens von Metternich emerged from the horrors of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, Siemann shows, committed above all to the preservation of peace. That often required him, as the Austrian Empire&#x2019;s foreign minister and chancellor, to back authority. He was, as Henry Kissinger has observed, the father of realpolitik. But short of compromising on his overarching goal Metternich aimed to accommodate liberalism and nationalism as much as possible. Siemann draws on previously unexamined archives to bring this multilayered and dazzling man to life. We meet him as a tradition-conscious imperial count, an early industrial entrepreneur, an admirer of Britain&#x2019;s liberal constitution, a failing reformer in a fragile multiethnic state, and a man prone to sometimes scandalous relations with glamorous women.</p><p>Hailed on its German publication as a masterpiece of historical writing, <i>Metternich</i> will endure as an essential guide to nineteenth-century Europe, indispensable for understanding the forces of revolution, reaction, and moderation that shaped the modern world.</p></p><p><p>Wolfram Siemann, one of Germany&#x2019;s leading historians of the nineteenth century, is Professor Emeritus for Modern and Contemporary History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.</p>&#x201c;Vast in scope and profound in learning, Wolfram Siemann&#x2019;s masterpiece, deftly translated by Daniel Steuer, refreshes every theme it touches and situates its protagonist in a landscape charged with texture and new meaning. At its center is a compelling and humane portrait of one of the most gifted and interesting statesmen of modern times. But this is more than a biography&#x2015;it is a window into the heart of Europe&#x2019;s nineteenth century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Clark, author of <i>Iron Kingdom</i> and <i>The Sleepwalkers</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;So rich is this wonderful book in insight and information, so brilliantly does it illuminate Metternich&#x2019;s exciting times, that no review can hope to do justice to its author&#x2019;s achievement.

For example, two thirds of Americans--including most history teachers--think the Confederate States seceded for "states' rights." This error persists because most have never read the key documents about the Confederacy.</p><p>These documents have always been there. When South Carolina seceded, it published "Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union." The document actually opposes states' rights. Its authors argue that Northern states were ignoring the rights of slave owners as identified by Congress and in the Constitution. Similarly, Mississippi's "Declaration of the Immediate Causes ..." says, "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world."</p><p>Later documents in this collection show how neo-Confederates obfuscated this truth, starting around 1890. The evidence also points to the centrality of race in neo-Confederate thought even today and to the continuing importance of neo-Confederate ideas in American political life. The 150th anniversary of secession and civil war provides a moment for all Americans to read these documents, properly set in context by award-winning sociologist and historian James W. Loewen and co-editor, Edward H. Sebesta, to put in perspective the mythology of the Old South.</p></p><p><p>Resounding documentary proof that the original reasoning behind secession and subsequently myth-making was in defense of slavery and white supremacy</p>Sociologist James W.

Storms is off his meds, no one is safe -- not Russian hoods, Jamaican mobsters, spoiled frat boys, women's book clubs, drug dealers, bad Vegas-rejected local lounge acts -- especially when $5 million in cash in a bugged suitcase is still racing up and down the Eastern Seaboard. But in the oddball circus known as the Sunshine State, little things like astronomical body counts tend to get lost in the shuffle.</p></p><p><p>Tim Dorsey was a reporter and editor for the Tampa Tribune from 1987 to 1999, and is the author of twenty-one novels: <em>Pope of Palm Beach, Clownfish Blues, Coconut Cowboy, Shark Skin Suite, Tiger Shrimp Tango, The Riptide Ultra-Glide, When Elves Attack, Pineapple Grenade, Electric Barracuda, Gator A-Go-Go, Nuclear Jellyfish, Atomic Lobster, Hurricane Punch, The Big Bamboo, Torpedo Juice, Cadillac Beach, The Stingray Shuffle, Triggerfish Twist, Orange Crush, Hammerhead Ranch Motel</em>, and <em>Florida Roadkill</em>. He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>In his latest bizarre concoction, Dorsey picks up--sort of--various plot strands from his earlier books, including <i>Florida Roadkill</i> (1999), <i>Hammerhead Ranch Motel</i> (2000), and <i>Orange Crush</i> (2001). There's still the matter, you see, of the briefcase full of cash, and still unresolved are the stories of Serge Storms, the serial killer and history buff; Johnny Vegas, the startlingly handsome virgin; Jethro Maddox, the Hemingway look-alike; and Paul, the Passive-Aggressive Private Eye. Fans of Dorsey's magnificently off-kilter adventures will be thrilled to rejoin these characters and to meet a host of new ones, including Mr. Granda, the leader of a down-and-out drug cartel who is looking to buy a submarine, and Ralph Krunkleton, one of America's very worst novelists, whose novel <i>The Stingray Shuffle</i> features prominently in the goings-on.

Nobody said a word. They stepped back politely and I could feel their eyes on me. Pat Chambers was standing by the door to the bedroom trying to steady Myrna. The girl&#x2019;s body was racking with dry sobs. I walked over and put my arms around her.</p><p>&#x201c;Take it easy, kid,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Come on over here and lie down.&#x201d; I led her to a studio couch that was against the far wall and sat her down. She was in pretty bad shape. One of the uniformed cops put a pillow down for her and she stretched out.</p><p>Pat motioned me over to him and pointed to the bedroom. &#x201c;In there, Mike,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>In there. The words hit me hard. In there was my best friend lying on the floor dead. The body. Now I could call it that. Yesterday it was Jack Williams, the guy that shared the same mud bed with me through two years of warfare in the stinking slime of the jungle. Jack, the guy who said he&#x2019;d give his right arm for a friend and did when he stopped a bastard of a Jap from slitting me in two. He caught the bayonet in the biceps and they amputated his arm.</p><p>Pat didn&#x2019;t say a word. He let me uncover the body and feel the cold face. For the first time in my life I felt like crying. &#x201c;Where did he get it, Pat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the stomach. Better not look at it. The killer carved the nose off a forty-five and gave it to him low.&#x201d;</p><p>I threw back the sheet anyway and a curse caught in my throat. Jack was in shorts, his one hand still clutching his belly in agony. The bullet went in clean, but where it came out left a hole big enough to cram a fist into.</p><p>Very gently I pulled the sheet back and stood up. It wasn&#x2019;t a complicated setup. A trail of blood led from the table beside the bed to where Jack&#x2019;s artificial arm lay. Under him the throw rug was ruffled and twisted. He had tried to drag himself along with his one arm, but never reached what he was after.</p><p>His police positive, still in the holster, was looped over the back </p><p>of the chair. That was what he wanted. With a slug in his gut he never gave up.</p><p>I pointed to the rocker, overbalanced under the weight of the .38. &#x201c;Did you move the chair, Pat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t belong there. Don&#x2019;t you see?&#x201d;</p><p>Pat looked puzzled. &#x201c;What are you getting at?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That chair was over there by the bed. I&#x2019;ve been here often enough to remember that much. After the killer shot Jack, he pulled himself toward the chair. But the killer didn&#x2019;t leave after the shooting. He stood here and watched him grovel on the floor in agony. Jack was after that gun, but he never reached it. He could have if the killer didn&#x2019;t move it. The trigger-happy bastard must have stood by the door laughing while Jack tried to make his last play. He kept pulling the chair back, inch by inch, until Jack gave up. Tormenting a guy who&#x2019;s been through all sorts of hell. Laughing. This was no ordinary murder, Pat. It&#x2019;s as cold-blooded and as deliberate as I ever saw one. I&#x2019;m going to get the one that did this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You dealing yourself in, Mike?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in. What did you expect?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to go easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-uh. Fast, Pat. From now on it&#x2019;s a race. I want the killer for myself. We&#x2019;ll work together as usual, but in the homestretch, I&#x2019;m going to pull the trigger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Mike, it can&#x2019;t be that way. You know it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Pat,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;You have a job to do, but so have I. Jack was about the best friend I ever had. We lived together and fought together. And by Christ, I&#x2019;m not letting the killer go through the tedious process of the law. You know what happens, damn it. They get the best lawyer there is and screw up the whole thing and wind up a hero! The dead can&#x2019;t speak for themselves. They can&#x2019;t tell what happened. How could Jack tell a jury what it was like to have his insides ripped out by a dumdum? Nobody in the box would know how it felt to be dying or have your own killer laugh in your face. One arm. Hell, what does that mean? So he has the Purple Heart. But did they ever try dragging themselves across a floor to a gun with that one arm, their insides filling up with blood, so goddamn mad to be shot they&#x2019;d do anything to reach the killer. No, damn it. A jury is cold and impartial like they&#x2019;re supposed to be, while some snotty lawyer makes them pour tears as he tells how his client was insane at the moment or had to shoot in self-defense. Swell. The law is fine. But this time I&#x2019;m the law and I&#x2019;m not going to be cold and impartial. I&#x2019;m going to remember all those things.&#x201d;</p><p>I reached out and grabbed the lapels of his coat. &#x201c;And something more, Pat. I want you to hear every word I say. I want you to tell it to everyone you know. And when you tell it, tell it strong, because I mean every word of it. There are ten thousand mugs that hate me and you know it. They hate me because if they mess with me I shoot their damn heads off. I&#x2019;ve done it and I&#x2019;ll do it again.&#x201d;</p><p>There was so much hate welled up inside me I was ready to blow up, but I turned and looked down at what was once Jack. Right then I felt like saying a prayer, but I was too mad.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack, you&#x2019;re dead now. You can&#x2019;t hear me any more. Maybe you can. I hope so. I want you to hear what I&#x2019;m about to say. You&#x2019;ve known me a long time, Jack. My word is good just as long as I live. I&#x2019;m going to get the louse that killed you. He won&#x2019;t sit in the chair. He won&#x2019;t hang. He will die exactly as you died, with a .45 slug in the gut, just a little below the belly button. No matter who it is, Jack, I&#x2019;ll get the one. Remember, no matter who it is, I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>When I looked up, Pat was staring at me strangely. He shook his head. I knew what he was thinking. &#x201c;Mike, lay off. For God&#x2019;s sake don&#x2019;t go off half-cocked about this. I know you too well. You&#x2019;ll start shooting up anyone connected with this and get in a jam you&#x2019;ll never get out of.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m over it now, Pat. Don&#x2019;t get excited. From now on I&#x2019;m after one thing, the killer. You&#x2019;re a cop, Pat. You&#x2019;re tied down by rules and regulations. There&#x2019;s someone over you. I&#x2019;m alone. I can slap someone in the puss and they can&#x2019;t do a damn thing. No one can kick me out of my job. Maybe there&#x2019;s nobody to put up a huge fuss if I get gunned down, but then I still have a private cop&#x2019;s license with the privilege to pack a rod, and they&#x2019;re afraid of me. I hate hard, Pat. When I latch on to the one behind this they&#x2019;re going to wish they hadn&#x2019;t started it. Some day, before long, I&#x2019;m going to have my rod in my mitt and the killer in front of me. I&#x2019;m going to watch the killer&#x2019;s face. I&#x2019;m going to plunk one right in his gut, and when he&#x2019;s dying on the floor I may kick his teeth out.</p><p>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t do that. You have to follow the book because you&#x2019;re a Captain of Homicide. Maybe the killer will wind up in the chair. You&#x2019;d be satisfied, but I wouldn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s too easy. That killer is going down like Jack did.&#x201d;</p><p>There was nothing more to say. I could see by the set of Pat&#x2019;s jaw </p><p>that he wasn&#x2019;t going to try to talk me out of it. All he could do was to try to beat me to him and take it from there. We walked out of the room together. The coroner&#x2019;s men had arrived and were ready to carry the body away.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want Myrna to see that. I sat down on the couch beside her and let her sob on my shoulder. That way I managed to shield her from the sight of her fianc� being carted off in a wicker basket. She was a good kid. Four years ago, when Jack was on the force, he had grabbed her as she was about to do a Dutch over the Brooklyn Bridge. She was a wreck then. Dope had eaten her nerve ends raw. But he had taken her to his house and paid for a full treatment until she was normal. For the both of them it had been a love that blossomed into a beautiful thing. If it weren&#x2019;t for the war they would have been married long ago.</p><p>When Jack came back with one arm it had made no difference. He no longer was a cop, but his heart was with the force. She had loved him before and she still loved him. Jack wanted her to give up her job, but Myrna persuaded him to let her hold it until he really got settled. It was tough for a man with one arm to find employment, but he had many friends.</p><p>Before long he was part of the investigating staff of an insurance company. It had to be police work. For Jack there was nothing else. Then they were happy. Then they were going to be married. Now this.</p><p>Pat tapped me on the shoulder. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a car waiting downstairs to take her home.&#x201d;</p><p>I rose and took her by the hand. &#x201c;Come on, kid. There&#x2019;s no more you can do. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t say a word, but stood up silently and let a cop steer her out the door. I turned to Pat. &#x201c;Where do we start?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll give you as much as I know. See what you can add to it. You and Jack were great buddies. It might be that you can add something that will make some sense.&#x201d;</p><p>Inwardly I wondered. Jack was such a straight guy that he never made an enemy. Even while on the force. Since he&#x2019;d gotten back, his work with the insurance company was pretty routine. But maybe an angle there, though.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack threw a party last night,&#x201d; Pat went on. &#x201c;Not much of an affair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I cut in, &#x201c;he called me and asked me over, but I was pretty well knocked out. I hit the sack early. Just a group of old friends he knew before the army.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. We got their names from Myrna. The boys are checking on them now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who found the body?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Myrna did. She and Jack were driving out to the country today to pick a building site for their cottage. She got here at eight a.m. or a little after. When Jack didn&#x2019;t answer, she got worried. His arm had been giving him trouble lately and she thought it might have been that. She called the super. He knew her and let her in. When she screamed the super came running back and called us. Right after I got the story about the party from her, she broke down completely. Then I called you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What time did the shooting occur?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The coroner places it about five hours before I got here. That would make it about three-fifteen. When I get an autopsy report we may be able to narrow it down even further.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone hear a shot?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. It probably was a silenced gun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even with a muffler, a .45 makes a good-sized noise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, but there was a party going on down the hall. Not loud enough to cause complaints, but enough to cover up any racket that might have been made here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about those that were here?&#x201d; Pat reached in his pocket and pulled out a pad. He ripped a leaf loose and handed it to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a list Myrna gave me. She was the first to arrive. Got here at eight-thirty last night. She acted as hostess, meeting the others at the door. The last one came about eleven. They spent the evening doing some light drinking and dancing, then left as a group about one.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at the names Pat gave me. A few of them I knew well enough, while a couple of the others were people of whom Jack had spoken, but I had never met.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did they go after the party, Pat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They took two cars. The one Myrna went in belonged to Hal Kines. They drove straight up to Westchester, dropping Myrna off on the way. I haven&#x2019;t heard from any of the others yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Both of us were silent for a moment, then Pat asked, &#x201c;What about a motive, Mike?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any yet. But I will. He wasn&#x2019;t killed for nothing. I&#x2019;ll bet this much, whatever it was, was big. There&#x2019;s a lot here that&#x2019;s screwy. You got anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing more than I gave you, Mike. I was hoping you could supply some answers.&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned at him, but I wasn&#x2019;t trying to be funny. &#x201c;Not yet. Not yet. They&#x2019;ll come though. And I&#x2019;ll relay them on to you, but by that time I&#x2019;ll be working on the next step.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cops aren&#x2019;t exactly dumb, you know. We can get our own </p><p>answers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not like I can. That&#x2019;s why you buzzed me so fast. You can figure things out as quickly as I can, but you haven&#x2019;t got the ways and means of doing the dirty work. That&#x2019;s where I come in. You&#x2019;ll be right behind me every inch of the way, but when the pinch comes I&#x2019;ll get shoved aside and you slap the cuffs on. That is, if you can shove me aside. I don&#x2019;t think you can.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Mike, call it your own way. I want you in all right. But I want the killer, too. Don&#x2019;t forget that. I&#x2019;ll be trying to beat you to him. We have every scientific facility at our disposal and a lot of men to do the leg work. We&#x2019;re not short in brains, either,&#x201d; he reminded me.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I don&#x2019;t underrate the cops. But cops can&#x2019;t break a guy&#x2019;s arm to make him talk, and they can&#x2019;t shove his teeth in with the muzzle of a .45 to remind him that you aren&#x2019;t fooling. I do my own leg work, and there are a lot of guys who will tell me what I want to know because they know what I&#x2019;ll do to them if they don&#x2019;t. My staff is strictly ex officio, but very practical.&#x201d;</p><p>That ended the conversation. We walked out into the hall where Pat put a patrolman on the door to make sure things stayed as they were. We took the self-operated elevator down four flights to the lobby and I waited while Pat gave a brief report to some reporters.</p><p>My car stood at the curb behind the squad car. I shook hands with Pat and climbed into my jalopy and headed for the Hackard Building, where I held down a two-room suite to use for operation.</p><p> <b> </b>Reprinted from The Mike Hammer Collection, Volume I by Mickey Spillane by permission of New American Library, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc.

She explains that self-esteem results from having a healthy balance of love and power in our lives. Readers will learn to incorporate love into situations that seem to require power and deal with power struggles that mask themselves as issues of love. From the bedroom to the boardroom, her strategies will enable us to escape feelings of shame, defeat, and depression; dissolve relationship hostility; and become our best selves. With Aron&#39;s clear, empathetic writing and extraordinary scientific and human insight, THE UNDERVALUED SELF is a simple and effective guide to developing healthy, fulfilling relationships, and finding true self-worth.</p><p>Elaine Aron, Ph.D., is recognized internationally as one of the leading scientists studying the psychology of love and close relationships. Her work has appeared in the<i> New York Times</i>, <i>Time Magazine</i>, and <i>National Geographic</i>, and she has appeared on national morning shows on many networks. She is the author of <i>The Highly Sensitive Person, The Highly Sensitive Person in Love,</i> and <i>The Highly Sensitive Child</i>. She divides her time between New York and San Francisco.Psychotherapist and "social psychologist" Aron (The Highly Sensitive Person) presents a "rich, complex and deeply layered" approach to building self-esteem, suitable for studious readers ready to work for understanding and change. Introducing lots of psychology terms and ideas, Aron's guide requires attention and concentration; regarding quick fixes like self-affirmations, Aron contends that research shows "they can make those with low self-esteem feel even worse about themselves." Instead, Aron investigates the basic concepts of ranking and linking, which play a role in all of our relationships and contribute to the ways we undervalue ourselves. Using a series of true/false questionnaires, case studies and analytical observation, Aron identifies the masks and self-defense strategies we use unconsciously to deal with traumatic events, and how those strategies affect self-worth. Topics under consideration include dreams, the specter of the Inner Critic, and self-sabotaging behavior like the Protector-Persecutor paradigm. Though the material can be hard to grasp, dedicated rereading will give readers a sophisticated understanding of low self-esteem, and concrete steps to improve it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whiteness was once thought to be invisible because of whites&#39; dominant position and ability to claim the mainstream, but today a large portion of whites actively identify with their racial group and support policies and candidates that they view as protecting whites&#39; power and status. In White Identity Politics, Ashley Jardina offers a landmark analysis of emerging patterns of white identity and collective political behavior, drawing on sweeping data. Where past research on whites&#39; racial attitudes emphasized out-group hostility, Jardina brings into focus the significance of in-group identity and favoritism. White Identity Politics shows that disaffected whites are not just found among the working class; they make up a broad proportion of the American public - with profound implications for political behavior and the future of racial conflict in America.</p><p>This book is for people who want to understand emerging patterns of white identity and collective political behavior in an increasingly diverse America. Drawing on robust evidence, Jardina shows that many whites possess an activated racial identity and support policies and candidates they see as protecting whites&#39; power and status.Ashley Jardina is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Duke University, North Carolina. She studies the nature of racial attitudes and group identities and their influence on public opinion and political behavior. Her research has been featured in The New York Times, Vox, and the Washington Post&#39;s Monkey Cage.</p><h2>Secrets of the Sommeliers: How to Think and Drink Like the World&#39;s Top Wine Professionals</h2><p>A fascinating exploration of the inside world of sommeliers, sharing their unique perspectives, extensive expertise, and best stories.<br><br>Rajat Parr&#x2019;s profound knowledge of wines, deep relationships with producers, and renowned tasting abilities have made him a legend in the business.

Sebottendorff explains how the mysterious abbreviated letters found in the Qur&#x2019;an represent formulas for perfecting the spirit of the individual. When combined with Masonic hand signs and grips and conducted accordingly to a precise schedule, these formulas incorporate spiritual power into the body and transform the soul from its base state into a noble, godlike state: the Magnum Opus of the medieval alchemists. <br> <br>Laying out the complete program of spiritual exercises, Sebottendorff explains each abbreviated word-formula in the Qur&#x2019;an, the hand gestures that go with them, and the exact order and duration for each exercise. Including a detailed biography of Sebottendorff and an examination of alchemy&#x2019;s Islamic heritage, this book shows how the traditions of Oriental Freemasonry can ennoble the self and lead to higher knowledge.</p><p>Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff (1875-1945) was a Freemason and practitioner of alchemy. In 1900 he moved to Turkey where he met the Jewish Termudi family, who introduced him to Rosicrucianism and led to his initiation into a local Masonic lodge. In 1910 he founded a lodge of the Bektashi Order in Constantinople. Returning to Germany, in 1917 he founded the Thule Society, an occult organization that led to the German Workers&#x2019; Party--joined in 1919 by Adolf Hitler, who transformed it into the Nazi Party. Sebottendorff left the Thule Society as it became increasingly political, fleeing to Turkey. Translator Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D., received his doctorate in Germanic languages and medieval studies from the University of Texas at Austin and studied the history of occultism at the University of G�ttingen, Germany. The author of more than two dozen books, including <i>Lords of the Left-Hand Path</i>, he lives near Austin, Texas.<b>Chapter 1 <br>Practice </b> <br> <br><i>Islam</i> means &#x201c;submission,&#x201d; that is, submission to the will of God. The believer can just commend himself to the will of God simply because it is the will of God. He feels secure and does not ask why this is so and that is different--he fulfills the divine law simply because it is the revealed law of God. He accepts his fate as being immutable and, at the most, attempts by means of prayer to implore for mercy from God when the burden becomes too great for him. But the sign of the true believer will consistently be that he does not ask for release from the burden, but rather for the strength to be able to bear it. &#x201c;Lead us in the way of those who do not err,&#x201d; the Prophet prescribes to those who pray. <br> <br>This faithful condition is what is most worthy to strive after, according to all religious systems. Actually he is also the most happy, it is he who the Prophet values most highly, and he represents this as his only goal--and therefore his religion is called Islam. <br> <br>Now beside the belief there is something else that makes it equally possible for a person to yield to his fate; it is no longer faith but knowledge--knowledge of the divine laws. The one who knows no longer fulfills this law blindly but rather knowingly. The truly wise one is very near to the believer, but he is superior to the believer. <br> <br>The Prophet created a very wise institution to open the way to knowledge for everyone who truly seeks it. According to this system in the Qur&#x2019;an he provided explicit signs, which point the way to knowledge, and which have to reveal the law of creation to someone who gains knowledge from within his own being. The highest form of knowledge will always lead the wise to yield to Divine Providence without complaint--that is, to Islam through knowledge. <br> <br>In what follows we will concern ourselves with this path. How the Prophet himself came into possession of this knowledge is recounted in the form of the following legend. <br> <br>Not far from Mecca there lived at the time of Mohammed an aged hermit, Ben Chasi, who was teaching the Prophet. When the lesson was over the hermit gave him a metallic plate upon which were engraved formulas, the meaning of which the then thirty-year-old Prophet had just learned. Soon thereafter the hermit died, but Mohammed kept on teaching the secret of these formulas in the most intimate circles. Abu Bekr, the first calif, inherited the plate and the knowledge, which only spread within a small circle after the death of the Prophet: this is the secret knowledge of the oriental Freemasons. <br> <br>In order to ensure against the loss of the formulas the Prophet distributed them throughout the Qur&#x2019;an according to a precise key. The key is known, and the formulas are preserved in the Qur&#x2019;an, such that the possibility remains for reconstructing the system at any time. <br> <br>The formulas are preserved in the so-called abbreviated letters,1 the meaning of which is debated among orientalists as well as different commentators. Some are of the opinion that these letters are signatures. Individual Suras certainly originated under highly variable conditions: the Prophet dictated some, others he recited while friends wrote them down, still others were recorded later from memory. When the Suras were collected, the letters, which indicated the originator of the Sura, would have remained, but now without their meaning. <br> <br>Some European scholars are of the view that these letters represent notes by the scribe. Thus ALM is supposed to mean: <i>amara li muhamed</i>--&#x201c;Mohammed commanded me to write.&#x201d; <br> <br>Arabic commentators view these letters as holy abbreviations. Thus ALM means: <i>allah latif madshid</i>--&#x201c;God is good.&#x201d; Or, as another thinks: <i>ana lahu alamu</i>--&#x201c;I am the God who knows.&#x201d; <br> <br>For others the letters are to be interpreted in a kabalistic sense. Certainly all the Suras in which these letters occur contain definite indications that they have something special to say. <br> <br>The Arabic language, like all the Semitic languages, does not write the vowels. If one does not read these letters as such, but rather as words, they yield no meaning. For this reason people have been scratching their heads over the meaning of these letters. But in actuality these are the secret formulas concealed in the letters that someone who knows the truth can now easily read and pronounce. All of these formulas are compounds of the vowel A with one or several consonants. <br> <br><b>Number of the Sura / Name of the Sura / Formula</b> <br> <br>2 / The Cow / alam <br>3 / Amran&#x2019;s Family / alam <br>7 / El Araf / alamas <br>10 / Jonah / alar <br>11/ Houd / alar <br>12 / Joseph / alar <br>13 / Thunder / alamar <br>14 / Abraham / alar <br>15 / A-hijr / alar <br>19 / Mary / kaha ya as <br>20 / Ta ha / ta ha <br>26 / The Poet / tasam <br>27 / The Ant / tas <br>28 / The Narration / tasam <br>29 / The Spider / alam <br>30 / The Greeks / alam <br>31 / The Wise / alam <br>32 / Adoration / alam <br>36 / Ya sin / yas <br>38 / Sad / sa <br>40 / The Believer / cham <br>41 / Revelations Well Expounded / cham <br>42 / Consultation / cham asak <br>43 / Gold Adornments / cham <br>44 / Smoke / cham <br>45 / Kneeling / cham <br>46 / Al ahqaf / cham <br>50 / Qaf / ka <br>68 / The Feather / na <br> <br><b>822 days--14 different formulas <br> <br></b>The formulas are present in twenty-nine Suras.

The first to be published outside Australia. Detailing the principles, techniques and systems for sustainable development of rural and urban landscapes. Keyline methods enable the rapid development of deep biologically fertile soil by converting subsoil into living topsoil. Keyline pattern cultivation enables the rapid flood irrigation of undulating land without terracing. Incidental results are the healing of soil erosion, bio-adsorption of salinity and the long term storage of atmospheric carbon in the soil as humus. The Keyline Scale of Permanence provides a priority guide to planning the various factors of broad scale development. This is a recommended text for Permaculture students. It includes updated selections and information; from P.A. Yeomans&#39;s books:- The Keyline Plan (1954); The Challenge of Landscape (1958); (Water for Every Farm (1964 and 2nd edition 1968) and The City Forest (1971). www.keyline.com.au</p><p>Biography: PERCIVAL ALFRED YEOMANS or &#34;P.A&#34; as he became known to all, changed Australian agriculture and the thinking and methods of the agricultural community. He was born in Harden N.S.W. in 1905, eldest son of a family of four. In 1928 he married Rita Irene May Barnes, also of Harden. They had three children; Neville in 1928, Allan in 1931 and Ken in 1947. Rita Yeomans died in 1964. Death duties forced the sale of the two original Keyline properties near Sydney. In 1966, &#34;P. A&#34; married Jane Radek. They had two daughters, Julie and Wendy. He designed and built equipment to deeply loosen soil without bringing up the subsoil. This equipment was the first rigid tyned vibrating sub-soil cultivating ripper for use with farm tractors. It is many times more efficient than a chisel plow, and is able to loosen more soil to a greater depth using less tractor power. The Prince Philip Design Award officially recognised the breakthrough success of this equipment in 1974 when P. A. Yeomans Pty Ltd received this coveted award for the Bunyip Slipper Imp with Shakaerator. P. A. Yeomans devoted much of his latter life time to consulting, advising and lecturing on Keyline planning for which he has received requests from many parts of the world. P. A. Yeomans passed away, aged 79 years, in November 1984. Biography - KEN B. YEOMANS H.D.A.. Ken was born in Sydney, as the youngest son of P. A. Yeomans. Ken graduated from Hawkesbury Agricultural College, Richmond N.S.W. in 1969 with a Hawkesbury Diploma of Agriculture (H.D.A.). Ken Yeomans was a foundation member of the Agricultural Technologists of Australasia and is a member of the Irrigation Association of Australia and the Biological Farmers of Australia. Ken has a consulting practice in property design and development in S-E Queensland. His services include the site selection, survey and plan preparation of earthworks for large farm dams and Keyline gravity irrigation systems as well as assessing and making recommendations on; rebuilding the living fertility of soil, grazing management, cultivation practices, cropping programs and subdivision design. Throughout the states of Australia and overseas, for clients with land holdings ranging in size from under four hectares to over four hundred thousand hectares, Ken Yeomans has applied his knowledge and experience of Keyline on family farms, multiple occupancy communities and rural holdings of large corporations.</p><h2>The Birth Book (Sears Parenting Library)</h2><p>Prepare for a safe and joyful birth-with the help of America&#39;s foremost baby and childcare experts Since women enjoy more birthing options today than ever before, the path toward a safe and satisfying birth can be fraught with important decisions. Planning, understanding the resources available to you, and developing your own birthing philosophy can make all the difference. In this comprehensive, reassuring, and authoritative guide, Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, the pediatrics specialists whose books on pregnancy, babies, and parenting have become widely praised bestsellers, thoroughly explore the abundant choices couples face when anticipating the birth of their child. The topics covered in The Birth Book include: * Selecting the right birthing environment and team *preparing physically and emotionally for childbirth *using prenatal tests and technology wisely *defining the father&#39;s role *selecting a childbirth class *lessening the discomfort and speeding the process of labor *choosing or avoiding anesthesia *finding the birthing position that&#39;s best for you and your baby *decreasing your chances for a cesarean birth *turning a surgical birth into a rewarding experience As the parents of eight children and as medical professionals with nearly three decades of experience, Dr. Bill and Martha Sears are uniquely qualified to answer virtually every question you might have about the birth process. Their one-of-a-kind guide, rich in information as well as inspiration, enables you to plan and create the birth you want.</p><p>In <i>The Birth Book: Everything You Need to Know to Have a Safe and Satisfying Birth</i>, William and Martha Sears, authors of <i>The Baby Book</i> and creators of the concept of "attachment parenting," here turn their attention to the birth experience. In this helpful resource guide, the Searses cover the gamut of possibilities, and teach readers what they need to know to take control of their own birthings. <i>The Birth Book</i> is divided into three parts: "Preparing for Birth," "Easing Pain in Labor," and "Experiencing Birth." You'll find details about vaginal births; cesareans; VBACs; water births; home births; best birthing positions; drugs; pain; how to design your own birth plan; the humor, chemistry, and sexuality of birth; and pages and pages of birth stories.This guide will do more for new parents than a pacifier will for a newborn. It is a comprehensive, soothing work which will ease the fears and anxieties that explode during a pregnancy, especially during the last trimester. The Searses ( The Baby Book )--he a pediatrician and professor at the University of Southern California's School of Medicine; she a childbirth and labor expert--are themselves the parents of eight children. They explain clearly and reassuringly the array of options available to pregnant couples, from what to consider when selecting a birthing team and environment and how technology can be a mixed blessing during pregnancy to having a VDAC (a vaginal delivery after having had a Caesarean birth). The book's philosophy is that delivering a baby is often an event that parents are more caught up with than the end-product--the baby. But the book offers more than philosophy. It gives men practical advice on how to survive the changes, both emotional and physical, that arrive with impending parenthood. There are quick-reference charts on the medical tests commonly ordered by physicians during pregnancy, contraction timing and the stages of labor. The final chapter is devoted to 14 birth stories which illustrate how labor and delivery are different for each woman. While no two experiences are alike, all illustrate the importance of making conscious choices about the birth of one's child. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cunningham&#39;s Book of Shadows: The Path of An American Traditionalist</h2><p><p>"Wiccan readers will treasure this blast from the past as one final word from the revered teacher."&#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em></p> <p>Llewellyn is pleased to present a new Scott Cunningham book&#x2015;a long-lost Book of Shadows.

This book is great for that. It looks at how sketching your pattern before machine stitching can help you map out what an entire quilt can look like (without leaving it to chance) and improve the quality of that stitching. She explores different ways of looking at a quilt in order to create different design areas and layouts so that you can choose which will suit your sewing style and the required pattern. Looking at blocks as a way of repeating pattern, using contrast to highlight portions of a quilt and breaking down a quilt pattern into its component pieces are all explored, and helpfully followed with pages for sketching to see how you have responded to each section.Patterns for borders (with suggestions of the best suited stitching for this area), using negative space to add movement or extend and connect the piecing in a quilt are explored, as are the extension of basic quilting designs into something new and exciting. All this culminates in examples of 27 free-motion quilting designs and then you are left to your own devices to take this advice and put it into practice on the book's worksheets.Although this is a short book, it is a hands-on approach to developing stitching ideas and planning out your approach to free-motion stitching more thoroughly. In this area, Angela Walters shows great expertise.

Spiritual mentor. Pastor. Executive director. Parent. Professor. Spouse. We have many roles and relationships. And in the midst of all we do, we're tempted to frantically take control of situations in hopes of making good things happen. Alan Fadling, author of <em>An Unhurried Life</em>, writes: "That kind of unholy hurry may make me look busy, but too often it keeps me from actually being fruitful in the ways Jesus wants me to be. Jesus modeled grace-paced leadership. To learn that we begin not with leading, but with following." In these pages Alan Fadling unfolds what it means for leaders to let Jesus set the pace. Through biblical illustrations, personal examples, and on-the-ground leadership wisdom, this book will guide you into a new view of kingdom leadership. Along the way you just might find that the whole of your life has been transformed into a more livable and more fruitful pace.</p><p>Alan Fadling (MDiv, Fuller Theological Seminary) is president and founder of Unhurried Living, Inc. in Mission Viejo, California, inspiring people to rest deeper, live fuller, and lead better.

It's all true! And it's an ongoing pursuit, which is why his book is so helpful. Rich with practical examples of practices to support this way of life and leadership, <em>An Unhurried Leader</em> is a great guide for anyone who seeks to lead from a place of overflow rather than deficit." (Mindy Caliguire, founder, Soul Care)<br><br>"In <em>An Unhurried Leader</em>, Fadling uses the Bible to unpack the wisdom of choosing to be led by Jesus as we lead others, so that our pace, ways, and results align with God's will. This is a book I highly recommend to everyone who is intentional about joining God at work and working God's way." (Jean Paul Ndagijimana, corporate chaplain, Lift Up Limited, Rwanda)<br><br>"At the heart of Christian spirituality is love. Jesus instructed us to love God and our neighbor. Paul said the greatest virtue is love. But love takes time&#x2015;and time is the one thing a hurried leader does not have. The results of unloving, anxious, fear-based Christian leadership are now all around us, as seen in the culture-wide rejection of church. In <em>An Unhurried Leader</em>, Alan Fadling points the way out of hurried leadership that kills the souls of leaders. He reveals leadership steeped in spiritual abundance and joy. This is not a how-to book. This book lays out a path to becoming a better sort of person, who is then naturally a better kind of leader." (Todd Hunter, Anglican bishop, author of Christianity Beyond Belief)<br><br>"Alan set out to offer an inspiring vision of leadership that is less hurried and more fruitful, less hectic and more joyful&#x2015;and that he did. With the biblical text as his consistent backdrop, each principle, practice, and suggested reflection creates a unique mosaic for every spiritual leader desirous of living an abundant life." (Stephen A. Macchia, founder and president of Leadership Transformations, and author of Broken and Whole)<br><br>"This book works! I began reading it hurriedly, but its soothing, consistent truth drew me to slow down and sense the presence of God." (Jan Johnson, speaker, author of Abundant Simplicity and Meeting God in Scripture)<br><br>"Alan Fadling has done it again! He writes in a way that challenges me to rethink my leadership. I love him and hate him at the same time for reminding me to love from an overflow and abundance rather than leading on empty. He doesn't just describe the problem, instead in <em>An Unhurried Leader</em> he gently and graciously guides the reader toward change that is doable and a reflection of the genius of Jesus' unhurried way of living and leading. Another must read!" (Doug Fields, author of Your First Two Years in Youth Ministry)<br><br>"The understanding of leadership that Alan Fadling describes in this book, if taken seriously, could point the way to a kind of leadership that could be similarly transforming. . . . The style of leadership that reflects an invitation to work with, not for, that is about watching how Jesus does it, taking our cues from Him, and learning the <em>unforced rhythms of grace</em> is the kind of leadership this book suggests. It is a kind of leadership that is equally effective in producing lasting fruit in the context of casual church governance, as it intentionally seeks to reflect and support the rhythms of life to which Jesus invites us. It is something that is both well worth contemplating and pursuing!" (Ken Curtis, Spectrum Magazine, July 29, 2017)<br><br>"With the pervasive frenetic pace that most of us find ourselves living in today, the phrase 'unhurried leader' sounds like an impossibility. Alan Fadling's book was the perspective I very much needed: a clear, hope-filled, and accessible invitation to a restful, yet fruitful, posture of leadership. I had read Alan's previous book, <em>An Unhurried Life</em>, and his most recent book brought forth a seamless follow up specifically geared toward the leader's mind and heart. In his graceful spirit, Alan reminded me what so many of us often forget: our leadership begins not in our leading, but in following the one who modeled a grace-paced life. This approach to leadership is not some slick fad or fantastical pipe dream; it's possible. More than that, it's necessary." (J. R. Briggs, CT Pastors, July 3, 2018)</p><h2>Types and Programming Languages (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive introduction to type systems and programming languages.</b></p><p>A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems&#x2015;and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective&#x2015;has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.</p><p>This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.</p><p>The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators.

It's also the story of a young boy opposing a genuinely terrifying foe: local businessman Tytus Boz is rumored to reuse the body parts of murdered enemies in his artificial limb company, and he&#x2019;s a heroin kingpin. Life as usual for Eli is a funny, heartbreaking mix of the mundane and the profane, rendered riveting by Eli&#x2019;s pragmatism and lack of cynicism. He corresponds with inmates, dreams of a career as a crime journalist, and falls in love. When circumstances force August and Eli to move in with their father, Eli must summon all he&#x2019;s learned to try to save his mother from crippling depression and, later, himself. Throughout it all, the two brothers slowly piece together a dreamlike childhood trauma.

Taken mainly from excerpts of <i>Money, Possessions, and Eternity, The Law of Rewards</i> shows how our faith determines our eternal destination but our behavior determines our eternal rewards. <br><br><i>The Law of Rewards</i> is published in association with Generous Giving, Inc., a ministry of The Maclellan Foundation, which offers practical tools and events designed to transform hearts and minds for revolutionary generosity.</p><p><b>Randy Alcorn</b> is the founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries (EPM). Prior to 1990, when he started EPM, he served as a pastor for fourteen years. He has spoken around the world and has taught on the adjunct faculties of Multnomah Bible College and Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon.Alcorn narrates his own work with skill as he examines why God intends believers to be &#34;His money managers.&#34; With an effortless-sounding narration he builds a compelling case for a scriptural concept he calls the &#34;Treasure Principle&#34;: Earthly investments in God&#39;s Kingdom bring eternal rewards. He also explains what the rewards are and how to claim them. Alcorn&#39;s ability to simplify and convey complex ideas about tithing, money management, and heaven&#39;s rewards is persuasive. While his ideas can be viewed as God&#39;s incentive program, he is quick to assure listeners that money management is linked to eternal rewards and not to salvation. Alcorn&#39;s easy-to-listen to voice affirms that those who store treasures on earth receive their reward on earth.

Larson, author of the famous &#x201c;Optimist Creed&#x201d; and one of the twentieth-century&#x2019;s pioneers of motivational thought.</b><p>&nbsp;<br>Contemporary research has shown that optimistic people experience longer and healthier lives, better relationships, and higher incomes. Generations before such findings, however, inspirational writer Christian D. Larson showed an amazing grasp of the life-changing power of gratitude and optimism. Today, Larson is known worldwide for his powerful meditation, &#x201c;The Optimist Creed,&#x201d; and other classics of spiritual living.<br><br>But no single volume has collected his greatest writings. Here, at last, is a long-overdue anthology that makes Larson&#x2019;s foundational writings available to the countless readers who already know his name and work.&nbsp;<br><br>Like no one else of his day, Larson understood the metaphysical and psychological dimensions of grateful living &#x2013; or, as he famously put it, &#x201c;an attitude of gratitude.&#x201d; Affirmative thought, Larson reasoned, sets in motion unseen forces, both spiritual and psychical, and aids in manifesting our desires. <br><i><br>The Optimist Creed</i> features complete editions of Larson&#x2019;s most deeply affecting works, each redesigned and reset. It contains: <b><i>The Pathway of Roses</i></b>; <b><i>Your Forces and How to Use Them</i></b> (the work that features his original &#x201c;Optimist Creed&#x201d;); <b><i>Mastery of Self</i></b>; <b><i>The Ideal Made Real</i></b>; and <b><i>Just Be Glad</i></b>.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Born in Iowa to Norwegian immigrants, <b>Christian D. Larson</b> (1874-1962) abandoned plans to pursue the ministry in favor of a more independent spiritual path. In 1901, at age 27, he launched one of the first journals devoted to positive-thinking, <i>Eternal Progress</i>. He moved to California and grew into a popular New Thought and inspirational writer and speaker, producing more than 40 books. Larson&#x2019;s most enduring work is the meditation called &#x201c;The Optimist Creed,&#x201d; which he originally published in 1912 as &#x201c;Promise Yourself.&#x201d; In 1922, it was officially adopted as the manifesto of Optimist International and today is quoted around the world."His words remain as powerful today as they were almost a century ago when they were written.

Simple prayer, powerful results.</p><p>Joyce Meyer lives in St. Louis, Missouri.Meyer, the spirited television preacher with more than 70 books in print, tackles the mystery of prayer with notable success. A prolific author (<i>The Confident Woman</i>; <i>Battlefield of the Mind</i>; <i>Approval Addiction</i>) known for delivering no-nonsense biblical commentary, does a first-rate job in this exhaustive, yet simply presented, guide. Each of the 14 chapters provides fans with a different facet of this spiritual discipline. Meyer says that for a fruitful prayer life, it's essential to understand the balance between praise, worship, thanksgiving and making petitions. She challenges Christians to both consecrate and fully commit themselves to God's service and to realize that though prayer is simple, it is also a work that requires persistence and perseverance. For Meyer, effective prayer is characterized by a life of obedience, righteousness, continual petition and submission to divine authority. Christians must be focused on others, kindhearted, forgiving and boldly expectant. While her large fan base will relish this resource, others not in the charismatic evangelical camp might be alienated by Meyer's take on "praying in a prayer language" and her assumption that blessing others automatically invites material blessings to rebound from God. Still, the book reminds Christians that prayer is a joyous task of partnering with God on eternal matters. <i>(Apr. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Over the past decades, the development of digital audio and video recording technology has continued to alter the practice of oral history, making it even easier to produce quality recordings and to disseminate them on the Internet. This basic manual offers detailed advice on setting up an oral history project, conducting interviews, making video recordings, preserving oral history collections in archives and libraries, and teaching and presenting oral history.<br>Using the existing Q&amp;A format, the third edition asks new questions and augments previous answers with new material, particularly in these areas:<br> 1. Technology: As before, the book avoids recommending specific equipment, but weighs the merits of the types of technology available for audio and video recording, transcription, preservation, and dissemination. Information about web sites is expanded, and more discussion is provided about how other oral history projects have posted their interviews online. <br> 2. Teaching: The new edition addresses the use of oral history in online teaching. It also expands the discussion of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) with the latest information about compliance issues.<br> 3. Presentation: Once interviews have been conducted, there are many opportunities for creative presentation. There is much new material available on innovative forms of presentation developed over the last decade, including interpretive dance and other public performances.<br> 4. Legal considerations: The recent Boston College case, in which the courts have ruled that Irish police should have access to sealed oral history transcripts, has re-focused attention on the problems of protecting donor restrictions. The new edition offers case studies from the past decade.<br> 5. Theory and Memory: As a beginner's manual, <em>Doing Oral History</em> has not dealt extensively with theoretical issues, on the grounds that these emerge best from practice. But the third edition includes the latest thinking about memory and provides a sample of some of the theoretical issues surrounding oral sources. It will include examples of increased studies into catastrophe and trauma, and the special considerations these have generated for interviewers.<br> 6. Internationalism: Perhaps the biggest development in the past decade has been the spreading of oral history around the world, facilitated in part by the International Oral History Association. New oral history projects have developed in areas that have undergone social and political upheavals, where the traditional archives reflect the old regimes, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The third edition includes many more references to non-U.S. projects that will still be relevant to an American audience.<br> These changes make the third edition of <em>Doing Oral History</em> an even more useful tool for beginners, teachers, archivists, and all those oral history managers who have inherited older collections that must be converted to the latest technology.<br></p><p><br><strong>Donald A.

In this well-loved classic, a little train carrying oodles of toys to all of the good boys and girls is confronted with a towering, seemingly impassable mountain. As nicely as they ask, the toys cannot convince the Shiny New Engine or the Big Strong Engine--far too impressed with themselves--to say anything but "I can not. I can not." It is left up to the Little Blue Engine to overcome insurmountable odds and pull the train to the other side. <i>The Little Engine That Could</i> is an entertaining and inspirational favorite, and the Little Blue Engine's rallying mantra "I think I can--I think I can" will resonate for a lifetime in the head of every child who hears it. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>)As creator of the immensely popular Otis the Tractor series, Loren Long has&nbsp;<i>putt puff puttedy chuff</i>ed his way all over the bestseller lists with such titles as&nbsp;<i>Otis</i>,<i>&nbsp;Otis and the Tornado</i>,&nbsp;<i>Otis and the Puppy, An Otis Christmas, </i>and Otis and the Scarecrow.

In this extraordinary work Nietzsche traces his life, work and development as a philosopher, examines the heroes he has identified with, struggled against and then overcome - Schopenhauer, Wagner, Socrates, Christ - and predicts the cataclysmic impact of his &#39;forthcoming revelation of all values&#39;. Both self-celebrating and self-mocking, penetrating and strange, Ecce Homo gives the final, definitive expression to Nietzsche&#39;s main beliefs and is in every way his last testament.</p><p>Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. He died in 1900. R.J.

This <i>New York Times</i> bestseller picks up where <i>Traveling Mercies</i> left off.</p><p>Few people can write about faith, parenting, and relationships as can the talented, irreverent Anne Lamott. With characteristic black humor, ("Everyone has been having a hard time with life this year; not with all of it, just the waking hours") she updates us on the ongoing mayhem of her life since <i>Traveling Mercies</i>, and continues to unfold her spiritual journey. <p> <i>Plan B</i> finds Lamott wrestling with mid-life hormones and weight gain while parenting Sam, now a teenager with his own set of raging hormones. Her observations cover everything from starting a Sunday school to grief over the death of her beloved dog, Sadie; lamenting the war to bitterness over her relationship with her now-departed mother. </p><p> As she tugs and pokes out the knots in a slender gold chain necklace, it becomes a metaphor for letting go and learning to forgive. "...<i>any</i> willingness to let go inevitably comes from pain; and the desire to change changes you, and jiggles the spirit, gets to it somehow, to the deepest, hardest, most ruined parts." It s her willingness to show us the knotted-up, "ruined parts" of her life that make this collection of sometimes uneven essays so compelling. </p><p> "Everything feels crazy," writes Lamott, adding, "But on small patches of earth all over, I can see just as much messy mercy and grace as ever...." Lamott s essays will serve as reminders to readers of the patches of messy mercy and grace in a chaotic world.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>The bestselling author of <i>Bird By Bird</i>, <i>Operating Instructions,</i> <i>Traveling Mercies</i>, and <i>Blue Shoe</i>, Anne Lamott is a past recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Included are chapters on sex, work, relationships and communication. Interspersed throughout are sidebars that shed light on the many faces of men and help women grasp what makes them act the way they do.</p><p>David Deida is known internationally for his transformative work in personal growth and intimate relationships. He completed advanced graduate work in psychobiology, sexual evolution and theoretical neuroscience. He also has more than 20 years of training in hatha yoga, tai chi, meditation and tantra. He has taught and conducted research at the University of California Medical School, San Diego; University of California, Santa Cruz; San Jose State University; Lexington Institute, Boston; and Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Why Are Men So Difficult?<br><br> <p>Most women, at one time or another, have wondered why their man was so difficult�why, on occasion, he behaved like a jerk. The answer is easy: Most men "give out" masculine energy. This, at times, is offensive to most women. What do I mean by "masculine energy"?</p> <p>Every man and woman has both masculine and feminine energy within them. In about 10 percent of all men, these energies balance. Another 10 percent of all men demonstrate more feminine energy than masculine. But about 80 percent of all men demonstrate more masculine than feminine energy. These men can often seem like jerks. </p> <p>These men are difficult for most women to deal with in intimacy because masculine energy is very different from feminine energy�and about 80 percent of women are naturally more feminine than masculine. Intimate relationships between a masculine man and a feminine woman often seem like a struggle between creatures from different planets. They try to communicate with one another in a language neither understands.</p> <p>Many men seem like jerks to many women because feminine energy is frequently confused, offended and hurt by the masculine, just as the masculine is by feminine energy. Once understood, the differences between masculine and feminine can become gifts men and women offer to one another in passionate love, rather than wrinkles to be ironed out.</p><br><br> Why Is He So Rigid?<br><br> <p>One masculine quality is modality, the ability to focus. Masculine energy tends to focus on doing one thing at a time. It moves on a single track. Have you ever tried to interrupt a man while he is absorbed in a project? Many men just won't notice you or else they will become angry and resentful.</p> <p>The feminine is much less modal. It's not stuck on a single track. It flows easily from one thing to another. It's much easier for a man or woman using their feminine energy to do several things at once. When men use their masculine energy, they may feel everything is falling apart when they are called on to do more than one thing at a time, or when they are suddenly pulled off a project.</p><br><br> Why Doesn't He Pay More Attention to Me?<br><br> <p>In both sexes, masculine energy is a vehicle of focus and accomplishment. This energy eliminates distraction and focuses on what needs to be done.</p> <p>For instance, when most men watch TV or work on a project, the rest of the world ceases to exist. That includes their intimate relationship. Even if the project is as mundane as waxing a car, masculine energy will focus and shut out the rest of the world. </p> <p>Masculine energy has the ability to focus. It's a strength, but a strength that can turn to weakness when it's used to avoid an intimate relationship. Feminine energy is quite good at flowing and relaxing. If your feminine energy is at work while waxing the car and your partner wants to talk with you, you can easily shift your attention and focus.</p> <p>Men often find it very difficult to shift, because they are stuck in their masculine energy. It's not easy for most men to break what they are doing, shift their attention to you and then flow back again. For women who are comfortable with their feminine energy, this ability to shift happens almost automatically. Many women might feel, <i>Why isn't he paying attention to me?, What's his problem?</i> You could take it personally, believing he's choosing to neglect you.</p> <p>If a woman friend were to neglect you it would send a definite message. Most women are very aware of relationships. But for men, absorption into a project or TV is rarely designed to send a message. It's just how they do things. That's how masculine energy works.</p> <p>Women often ask, "Can't my man learn to go with the flow? Can't he be more flexible? Why does he have to be so rigid and single-minded?" </p> <p>Men may wonder, "Why does she get hurt when I'm busy? Can't she understand it's not personal? What a hassle! She gets hurt every time I'm doing what I like to do. Can't she change?"</p> <p>If you want to trust your man to get the job done, try to accept his need to focus. Without this quality, your man might not carry through with projects he starts. You would begin to feel like you had to do them yourself. You would lose trust in him.</p> <p>You can't expect a man to get things done and not be focused. For a man to drop this quality he has to move into his feminine energy, where he may lose his focus and fail to get the job done. </p><br><br> Why Does His Work Seem More Important than Me?<br><br> <p>When your man is hard at work, it doesn't necessarily mean he's shutting you out. He's not being insensitive, turning away or avoiding participation with you. When he's focused on a project or a task, that becomes the whole world to him.</p> <p>Men are either in one mode or another. For instance, a man could be having problems with his wife yet still enjoy an outing with his male friends. On a fishing trip a friend could ask, "How are things at home?" He'll say, "Man, it sucks. Wow, look at the size of that fish!" </p> <p>For most women, or anyone in their feminine energy, the intimate relationship touches their lives no matter what they're doing. It's difficult to drop the relationship, get absorbed in something, enjoy it completely, then go back to the relationship.</p> <p>A man who temporarily "forgets" his relationship may not be avoiding his feelings. The same thing may happen to you when you are in your masculine energy. When the masculine energy focuses, everything else disappears. </p> <p>If you were in the midst of an emotionally charged thought or feeling and your partner said "Can you get the catsup for me?", it would disrupt your emotions and probably frustrate you. When you inject your emotional mode into his action mode, it feels the same way to him.</p> <p>Men don't exist so much in a world of flow and feelings. To a large extent, they exist in a world of problems, functions and challenges.</p> <p>Most archetypal myths of men involve battling demons, enemies, war and conquest. They involve breaking free and winning. Most archetypal myths about women involve love relationships. Men and women play in very different domains. If you want to be married to a masculine man, as opposed to a feminine or more neutral man, then part of the package you get is his modality, his ability to focus.</p> <p>When your man thinks your emotions are wrong, it can throw off the whole relationship. Emotions can't be wrong, they simply are. In the same way, his action mode is not wrong, it just is. But this doesn't mean you can't gift him with your feelings, sensitivity, intuition and wisdom. </p> <p>Two of the biggest gifts you bring to your man are your sensitivity and intuition. He can learn a lot from your world that is foreign to his. And you can also learn from him.</p> <p>Don't disown your feelings. If you really feel it's best for him to be interrupted, then interrupt him. Just remember that you may encounter some initial resentment, because he's stuck in one mode.</p><br><br> Why Isn't He Aware of How He Hurts Me?<br><br> <p>When your man gets involved in something and doesn't pay attention to you, it hurts. He probably doesn't feel he's turning away from you. He may not be aware of it at all.</p> <p>When your man turns away or becomes involved in something else, you could say, "Did you notice that half an hour ago we were making love when the phone rang? Since you hung up you haven't even looked at me." He'll look puzzled, and mumble "Yeah, okay." </p> <p>You could also say, "I felt a sudden shift in your attention. One moment we were passionate, the next moment nothing. Our hearts were connected, and now they are not." It will seem bizarre to you that he doesn't feel any of this, but he usually doesn't.</p> <p>When I lead men's groups, we spend a lot of time talking about this. I try to convince the men that women do feel the shifts in a man's attention. The men don't believe it. They'll say, "You're kidding, right?" I'll say, "I'm serious. If you're with a woman and you suddenly turn away and begin to work, she feels it in her body. She feels your attention moving away from her. She feels hurt." The men will usually respond, "How are you supposed to live with that?"</p> <p>Men often have no idea they've hurt you. When you tell them, it helps if you understand their perspective. Talk to them as if they've fallen asleep and reawakened. So rather than criticize their actions, tell them how it makes you feel. Say, "When you picked up the phone I felt hurt," rather than "Don't pick up the phone when we are together." You can tell them how it makes you feel. Then they can handle it.</p> <p>But if you expect a man to know they've hurt you, they'll say, "What hurt you?" They don't sense the turning away is as hurtful as it is to you. </p><br><br> What Can I Do When He Seems So Burdened?<br><br> <p>At their core, most men feel constrained by life. It is a struggle for men to simply enjoy life. Most everything feels like a constraint and an obligation to them. It sometimes feels this way to women also, but for most men it always feels this way. </p> <p>Have you seen the bumper stickers that say, "Life sucks"? That's the masculine motto. That's why all men are driven either to escape or conquer life. They may do this by becoming absorbed in the newspaper, watching TV, making a lot of money, using drugs, or even by practicing meditations which promise to help them transcend daily life.</p> <p>Daily life. Being in a body, having relationships, caring for children, needing to eat. Existence seems like a burden or a challenge to most men, something to work on or escape from, something to conquer. </p> <p>Because a woman is so connected to life, it's hard for her to understand the need to conquer or escape it. But for most men, even being in a body is a problem. If a man is the conqueror type, he will attempt to push his body and make it do what he wants, applying his energy to push toward victory in the affairs of life.</p> <p>For a man life seems like a constraint, be it his body, his relationship or his work�until he learns to practice love. Just like Jesus on the cross, most men feel crucified by life. A spiritually mature man learns to love in the midst of this crucifixion. Even so, he may still feel like life is a sacrifice. I'm overstating this to make a point, but men are always attempting to do something with life, because they are not at home in life. Rarely is a man capable of being love in the midst of life, submitting to the crucifixion, suffering life's limitations, and yet bringing love into his relationships.</p> <p>Some of your special gifts to your man as his chosen woman are energy and attraction. You attract him toward life by your radiance, and give him the energy to endure the crucifixions of life through the power of your love.</p> <p>Your gifts of energy, of radiance, of attraction, may take the form of your genuine smile, the look of love in your eyes, your touch that enlivens him, anything that fills his body, mind and emotions with energy, love and life. Then he feels you as his source of delight in an otherwise burdensome world.</p><br><br> Why Is He So Obsessed with Perfection?<br><br> <p>Men, or anyone in their masculine energy, typically seek perfection. It could be the perfect wax job on the car, or the perfect wave to surf, or the perfect touchdown. Women, of course, also seek perfection at times. But the feminine priority, in man or woman, is usually the desire for love.</p> <p>If you, as a woman, are suffering in a poor relationship, how much will you enjoy the "perfect" wax job on your car? Many men, however, become totally obsessed with things like that even in the midst of a painful relationship. In fact, they particularly become obsessed by things like that during painful times. It's their little way of engaging in the perfection of unblemished consciousness, consciousness that is always perfect. </p> <p>Our masculine and feminine ways are not only rooted in our biological roots, but also in our spiritual depths. As it has been said in many spiritual traditions, the first thing created was light. This light is the true source of our feminine energy, and the void in which it shines is the source of our masculine.</p> <p>That's why many women are concerned with their radiance. They identify themselves as sources of light or energy. They want shiny hair, glossy lips, blushed cheeks, glowing skin, radiant eyes. The feminine in each of us feels akin to life force itself.</p> <p>The masculine in each of us feels more akin to the void in which the light shines. Most men would rather watch women dance than dance themselves. They want to witness feminine radiance. Thus, men identify more with the witness, with awareness, with consciousness itself.</p> <p>This consciousness never moves, while the feminine energy always moves. This consciousness never changes, while the feminine energy always changes. Men who stand firm and trustable in their deep truth are more sexy to women. Women who move their bodies freely in radiant energy are more sexy to men.</p> <p>Men seek perfection in the external world�in their philosophies, golf games and a centerfold's body�because they intuit the perfection of deep and eternal consciousness. But they misplace this desire for perfection. Deep consciousness, or divine consciousness, may be perfect, changeless and unblemished, but life is not. Life is the play of energy. Life is feminine!</p> <p>Anything that is alive is not perfect, though men try to make it so. They try to perfect their golf game. They fantasize over perfect women's bodies. They try to understand the perfect philosophy. Men seek perfection because they intuit the nature of consciousness, which is unchanging. </p> <p>Changeless perfection is irrelevant for the feminine. The feminine is interested in love and life, and life includes birth and death and change. Life is not unchanging and perfect all the time.</p> <p>For consciousness purists, however, change is anathema. Men, especially when feeling threatened by the feminine, want to retreat from the changes of life into perfection, voidness, or unchanging abstraction. </p> <p>They become immersed in a newspaper, or in TV, something that removes them from the problems of life. Or, they become focused obsessively on perfection in some trivial form, because that's the closest they can get to the perfection of unblemished consciousness. Men are most at home in projects, sports, philosophy and ideas outside of the daily ups and downs of life. </p> <p>If a woman is obsessed with perfection, she has probably rejected her own feminine. For some reason, she has identified with her masculine energy. Just as men must learn to embrace life and love in order to become whole, perfectionist women must learn to embrace the feminine part of themselves and others. This begins with an embrace of the body itself: a sensuous appreciation for the body, for bodily pleasure, for the body's wild energy, for the body's beauty, for a full, sweet breath, and a soft, open heart. This embrace of the feminine is also the cure for a man's obsessive perfectionism. If men don't embrace the fullness of life, of feminine change, then they become one-sided. Men need to learn that if they want light, radiance and energy in their life then they need to embrace all the changes and so-called "blemishes," too.</p><br><br> Why Do I Feel Him Rejecting Me So Often?<br><br> <p>The primary masculine fear is the fear of failure in life. The primary feminine fear is the fear of rejection in a relationship, the fear of the loss of love. These fears motivate you and your ma...</p></p><h2>The Poems of Catullus (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Of all Greek and Latin poets Catullus is perhaps the most accessible to the modern reader.

Belonging to neither land nor sea, they cling to one another in a motley yet kindly society. There is Maurice, by occupation a male prostitute, by happenstance a receiver of stolen goods. And Richard, a buttoned-up ex-navy man whose boat dominates the Reach. Then there is Nenna, a faithful but abandoned wife, the diffident mother of two young girls running wild on the waterfront streets.<br><br>It is Nenna&#x2019;s domestic predicament that, as it deepens, draws the relations among this scrubby community together into ever more complex and comic patterns. The result is one of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s greatest triumphs, a novel the Booker judges deemed &#x201c;flawless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A marvelous achievement: strong, supple, humane, ripe, generous, and graceful.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Sunday Times</i></p><p><i>Offshore</i> possesses perfect, very odd pitch. In just over 130 pages of the wittiest and most melancholy prose, Penelope Fitzgerald limns the lives of "creatures neither of firm land nor water"--a group of barge-dwellers in London's Battersea Reach, circa 1961. One man, a marine artist whose commissions have dropped off since the war, is attempting to sell his decrepit craft before it sinks. Another, a dutiful businessman with a bored, mutinous wife, knows he should be landlocked but remains drawn to the muddy Thames. A third, Maurice, a male prostitute, doesn't even protest when a criminal acquaintance begins to use his barge as a depot for stolen goods: "The dangerous and the ridiculous were necessary to his life, otherwise tenderness would overwhelm him." <p> At the center of the novel--winner of the 1979 Booker Prize--are Nenna and her truant six- and 11-year-old daughters. The younger sibling "cared nothing for the future, and had, as a result, a great capacity for happiness." But the older girl is considerably less blithe. "Small and thin, with dark eyes which already showed an acceptance of the world's shortcomings," Fitzgerald writes, she "was not like her mother and even less like her father. The crucial moment when children realise that their parents are younger than they are had long since been passed by Martha." </p><p> Their father is farther afield. Unable to bear the prospect of living on the <i>Grace</i>, he's staying in Stoke Newington, part of London but a lost world to his wife and daughters. Meanwhile, Nenna spends her time going over incidents that seem to have led to her current situation, and the matter of some missing squash racquets becomes of increasing import. Though she is peaceful by nature, experience and poverty are wearing Nenna down. Her confidante Maurice, after a momentary spell of optimism, also returns to his life of little expectation and quiet acceptance: "Tenderly responsive to the self-deceptions of others, he was unfortunately too well able to understand his own." </p><p> Penelope Fitzgerald views her creations with deep but wry compassion. Having lived on a barge herself, she offers her expert spin on the dangers, graces, and whimsies of river life. Nenna, too, has become a savant, instantly recognizing on one occasion that the mud encasing the family cat is not from the Reach. This "sagacious brute" is almost as complex as his human counterparts, constantly forced to adjust her notions of vermin and authority. Though Stripey is capable of catching and killing very young rats, the older ones chase <i>her</i>. "The resulting uncertainty as to whether she was coming or going had made her, to some extent, mentally unstable." </p><p> As always, Fitzgerald is a master of the initially bizarre juxtaposition. Adjacent sentences often seem like delightful non sequiturs--until they flash together in an effortless evocation of character, era, and human absurdity. Nenna recalls, for instance, how the buds had dropped off the plant her husband rushed to the hospital when Martha was born. She "had never criticized the bloomless azalea. It was the other young mothers in the beds each side of her who had laughed at it. That had been 1951. Two of the new babies in the ward had been christened Festival." Tiny comical epiphanies such as these have caused the author to be dubbed a "British miniaturist." Yet the phrase utterly misses the risks Fitzgerald's novellas take, the discoveries they make, and the endless pleasures they provide. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1998, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0-395-47804-2</p><h2>Fail, Fail Again, Fail Better: Wise Advice for Leaning into the Unknown</h2><p>When her granddaughter was accepted to Naropa University, the celebrated author Pema Ch�dr�n promised that she&#x2019;d speak at the commencement ceremony. <i>Fail, Fail Again, Fail Better</i> contains the wisdom shared on that day.

She taught as an elementary school teacher for many years in both New Mexico and California. Pema has two children and three grandchildren.</p><p>While in her mid-thirties, Ani Pema traveled to the French Alps and encountered Lama Chime Rinpoche, with whom she studied for several years. She became a novice nun in 1974 while studying with Lama Chime in London. His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa came to Scotland at that time, and Ani Pema received her ordination from him.</p><p>Pema first met her root guru, Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, in 1972. Lama Chime encouraged her to work with Rinpoche, and it was with him that she ultimately made her most profound connection, studying with him from 1974 until his death in 1987. At the request of the Sixteenth Karmapa, she received the full bikshuni ordination in the Chinese lineage of Buddhism in 1981 in Hong Kong.</p><p>Ani Pema served as the director of Karma Dzong in Boulder, Colorado until moving in 1984 to rural Cape Breton, Nova Scotia to be the director of Gampo Abbey.

Born Deirdre Blomfield-Brown in New York City, the author converted to Buddhism in her thirties, became a disciple of Ch�gyam Trungpa, and ultimately the leader of the Boulder Shambhala Center in Colorado. She is also the author of such works as The Wisdom of No Escape and Start From Where You Are, which brought her a wide, attentive audience. This latest book arose from a request to speak at her granddaughter&#x2019;s commencement. Chodron presents wisdom inherent in allowing oneself to fail. The text has been enlarged by brushstroke-like artwork, a follow-up interview with Sounds True founder and publisher Tami Simon, and an introduction by entrepreneur Seth Godin. VERDICT This brief text has all of the pleasures of a stocking-stuffer but is suitable to other seasons as well and by no means limited in its appeal to followers of Buddhism or recent graduates.&#x201d; &#x2015;Library Journal</p><p>&#x201c;For Boulder, Colo.&#x2013;based Naropa University&#x2019;s 2014 commencement ceremony, Ch�dr�n (When Things Fall Apart) told new graduates that "knowing how to fail well" is an essential&#x2015;and neglected&#x2015;life skill. Ch�dr�n, an American Buddhist nun, popular author, and student of the late Ch�gyam Trungpa, urges her audience to hold the 'rawness of vulnerability in [your] heart' rather than blaming self or others. This volume pairs a transcript of the very short speech, accompanied by abstract black and white drawings, with a more substantive interview with her publisher, in which Ch�dr�n talks candidly about her personal experiences with failure and explores self-hatred, human goodness, and fear. She provides insightful suggestions for how to move forward into life despite crushing failure, how to turn regret into empathy and compassion, and how to cope gracefully with a failing body. This small book, an appropriate gift for recent graduates or anyone facing a challenging transition, also contains sustenance for loyal Ch�dr�n fans, and introduces new readers to her gentle wisdom for living in a 'world where there are a lot of things that aren&#x2019;t fixable.&#x201d; &#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p>&#x201c;Pema Ch�dr�n promised to speak at her granddaughter&#x2019;s graduation from Naropa University. When asked what her speech would be about, she declined to answer because she had decided to speak to those enthusiastic young graduates about failure. True to her compassionate nature, it turned out to be some of the best advice they would ever receive. She described failing as "getting good at holding the rawness of vulnerability in your heart." She encouraged them to embrace the discomfort of failure rather than blaming others or themselves. She recounted her own painful struggle with turning failure into strength. She suggested that failure is just a shift in the direction of our lives. The last section of the book is a follow-up interview with her which was conducted by Founder &amp; CEO of Sounds True, Tami Simon. During Simon&#x2019;s interview she had the chance to discuss the deeper layers of the ideas she had offered to those young people. Ch�dr�n has a talent for connecting mind to mind through the heart. This book is another beautiful example of her skill.&#x201d; &#x2015;Anna Jedrziewski, Retailing Insight</p></p><h2>He, She and It: A Novel</h2><p><b>"A triumph of the imagination.

Shira Shipman's marriage has broken up, and her young son has been taken from her by the corporation that runs her zone, so she has returned to Tikva, the Jewish free town where she grew up. There, she is welcomed by Malkah, the brilliant grandmother who raised her, and meets an extraordinary man who is not a man at all, but a unique cyborg implanted with intelligence, emotions&#x2014;and the ability to kill. . . .<br><br>From the imagination of Marge Piercy comes yet another stunning novel of morality and courage, a bold adventure of women, men, and the world of tomorrow.</p><p><b>Marge Piercy</b> has written seventeen novels including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Gone to Soldiers, </i>the national bestsellers <i>Braided Lives</i> and <i>The Longings of Women,</i> and the classic <i>Woman on the Edge of Time, </i>as well as <i>He, She and It</i> and <i>Sex Wars;</i> nineteen volumes of poetry including <i>The Hunger Moon: New and Selected Poems 1980&#x2013;2010, The Crooked Inheritance,</i> and <i>Made in Detroit;</i> and the critically acclaimed memoir <i>Sleeping with Cats</i>.

A bead of sweat slid down the furrow of his spine&#x2014;he wore a backless business suit, white for the formality of the occasion, very like her own&#x2014;and it was hard even now to keep from delicately brushing his back with her scarf to dry it. The Yakamura-Stichen dome in the Nebraska desert was conditioned, of course, or they would all be dead, but it was winter now and the temperature was allowed to rise naturally to thirty Celsius in the afternoon as the sun heated the immense dome enclosing the corporate enclave. Her hands were sweating too, but from nervousness. She had grown up in a natural place and retained the ability to endure more heat than most Y-S gruds. She kept telling herself she had nothing to fear, but her stomach was clenched hard and she caught herself licking her lips again and again. Every time she called up time on her internal clock and read it in the corner of her cornea, it was at most a minute later than when last she had evoked it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The room glittered in black and white marble, higher than wide and engineered to intimidate, Shira knew from her psychoengineering background. Her field was the interface between people and the large artificial intelligences that formed the Base of each corporation and every other information-producing and information-eating entity in the world, as well as the information utility called the Network, which connected everyone. But she had enough psychological background to recognize the intent of the chamber where with their assigned lawyers they sat upright and rigid as tuning forks for the blow that would set them quivering into sound. Perched around them were similar groups in waiting: breaches of marriage contract, custody cases, complaints of noncompliance and abuse, each group staring at the blank view screen. From time to time a face appeared, one of those ideal, surgically created Y-S faces&#x2014;blond hair, blue eyes with epicanthic folds, painted brows like Hokusai brush strokes, aquiline nose, dark golden complexion. It would announce a verdict, and then a group would swirl around itself, rise and go, some beaming, some grim-faced, some weeping.<br> &nbsp;<br> She should not be as frightened as she was. She was a techie like Josh, not a day laborer; she had rights. Her hands incubated damp patches on her thighs. She hoped their verdict would be announced soon. She had to pick up Ari at the midlevel-tech day care center in forty-five minutes, some twenty minutes&#x2019; glide from the official sector. She did not want him waiting, frightened. He was only two years and five months, and she simply could not make him understand: Don&#x2019;t worry, Mommy may be a little late. It was her fault, insisting on the divorce in December, for ever since, Ari had been skittish; and Josh bitter, furious. Twice as alive. If he had loosed in their marriage the passion her leaving had provoked, they might have had a chance together. He fought her with full energy and intelligence, as she had wanted to be loved.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everything was her fault. She should never have married Josh. She had been passionately in love only once in her life, too young, and never again; but if she had not married Josh, she would not have had Ari. Oh, she felt guilty all right as she looked at Josh&#x2019;s narrow back, the deep groove of his spine, vulnerable, bent slightly forward as if some chill wind blew only on him. She had promised to love him, she had tried to love him, but the relationship had felt thin and incomplete.<br> &nbsp;<br> During their courtship, she had thought he was beginning to learn to talk to her, to respond more sensually and directly. In the born-again Shintoism of Y-S, they were both marranos, a term borrowed from the Spanish Jews under the Inquisition who had pretended to be Christian to survive. Y-S followed a form of revivalist Shinto, Shinto grafted with Christian practices such as baptism and confession. Marranos in contemporary usage were Jews who worked for multis and went to church or mosque, paid lip service and practiced Judaism secretly at home. All multis had their official religion as part of the corporate culture, and all gruds had to go through the motions. Like Shira, Josh had the habit of lighting candles privately on Friday night, of saying the prayers, of keeping the holidays. It had seemed rational for them to marry. He had been at Y-S for ten years. She had come straight from graduate school, at twenty-three. Y-S had outbid the other multis for her in Edinburgh&#x2014;like most of the brightest students in Norika, the area that had been the U.S. and Canada, she had gone to school in the affluent quadrant of Europa&#x2014;so she had had no choice but to come here. She had been lonely, unused to the strict and protocol-hedged hierarchy of Y-S. She had grown up in the free town of Tikva, accustomed to warm friendships with women, to men who were her pals. Here she was desperately lonely and constantly in minor trouble. Often she wondered if her troubles were caused by the particular corporate culture of Y-S, or if it would be the same in any multi enclave. There were twenty-three great multis that divided the world among them, enclaves on every continent and on space platforms. Among them they wielded power and enforced the corporate peace: raids, assassinations, skirmishes, but no wars since the Two Week War in 2017.<br> &nbsp;<br> Josh had been born to an Israeli couple, survivors of the Two Week War a terrorist had launched with a nuclear device that had burned Jerusalem off the map, a conflagration of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that had set the oilfields aflame and destroyed the entire region. He had been orphaned at ten, wandering without a country in the period Jews called the Troubles, when the whole world blamed them for the disasters that put an end to oil dependence in a maelstrom of economic chaos. Nothing had come easy to him in his life. The more he opened to her and told her, the more precious he seemed to her, in that fervid courtship, and the more she felt herself absolutely necessary to him. She was astonished that at first she had thought him cold. How he had suffered! He needed her like air itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had seemed to be opening. Shortly after the marriage he had insisted upon, he began changing back. He acted happy. He seemed delighted with her; but from a distance. As for getting to know her better, as for sharing his inner life or taking an interest in hers, those pastimes seemed uninteresting to him, lacking in urgency. Ari was supposed to mend that breach. Since the birth of their son, all Josh&#x2019;s after-work energy focused on Ari. She often suspected that if they did not have Ari, they would have nothing to talk about. Their silence roared in her ears. Soon she was boiling with resentments. They fought forty skirmishes a day about nothing. As her grandmother Malkah had warned her when she married Josh, she had made a costly mistake. Living together combined for them the worst aspects of living alone and living with a stranger. Their major activity together was disagreeing. She had grown up in a benign household, for Malkah was feisty and opinionated but also loving and funny. People did not have to live unremitting desperate wars. Shira had summoned her energy and left him.<br> &nbsp;<br> She called up the time on her cornea. Only four minutes had passed since she had last asked. Finally the long-skulled face appeared and spoke, in its uninflected way, their names: Joshua Rogovin and Shira Shipman, re the custody of child Ari Rogovin. Even in Y-S, with its male dominance, women did not change their names. Marriages were on the basis of five- or ten-year contracts, and name changing without purpose was inefficient. Still, Shira felt an odd chill as she heard Ari&#x2019;s surname given as his father&#x2019;s. That was not how she had registered him at birth, but Y-S had ignored her preference.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In regard to this matter the judgment of the panel is to award custody to the father, Joshua Rogovin, status T12A, the mother, Shira Shipman, status T10B, to have visitation privileges twice weekly, Wednesdays and Sundays. This verdict rendered 28 January 2059, automatic review on 28 January 2061. Verdict recorded. Out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Josh turned in his seat and glared at her. His lawyer was beaming and slapping his shoulder. &#x201c;What did I tell you? In the bag.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t do this!&#x201d; Shira said. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t take Ari!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Josh grimaced, almost a smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s mine now. He&#x2019;s my son, he&#x2019;s a Rogovin.&#x201d; His light eyes, somewhere between gray and blue, seemed to read her pain and dismiss it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your ex-husband has a higher tech rating than you do,&#x201d; her lawyer said. &#x201c;I warned you they would take that into account. You&#x2019;ve been stuck in the same grade for three years.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll appeal. Ari needs me.&#x201d; And I need him, she thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your choice, but you&#x2019;re throwing away your credit, in my opinion. Of course I&#x2019;ll represent you if you choose to retain me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Josh and his lawyer had already swept out. Shira&#x2019;s lawyer stood over her, impatiently tapping his foot. &#x201c;I have another client to see. You think about the appeal. I can start the process tomorrow if you choose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly she rose and rushed out, realizing she was late to pick up Ari. &#x201c;Start the appeal,&#x201d; she called over her shoulder. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let him go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Power to the People!: Russian Strength Training Secrets for Every American</h2><p>How would you like to own a world class body-whatever your present condition- by doing only two exercises, for twenty minutes a day?

Defined when they first meet by what their husbands do, the young homemakers and mothers are far removed from the Summer of Love that has enveloped most of the Bay Area in 1967. These &#x201c;Wednesday Sisters&#x201d; seem to have little in common: Frankie is a timid transplant from Chicago, brutally blunt Linda is a remarkable athlete, Kath is a Kentucky debutante, quiet Ally has a secret, and quirky, ultra-intelligent Brett wears little white gloves with her miniskirts. But they are bonded by a shared love of both literature&#x2014;Fitzgerald, Eliot, Austen, du Maurier, Plath, and Dickens&#x2013;and the Miss America Pageant, which they watch together every year.<br><br> As the years roll on and their children grow, the quintet forms a writers circle to express their hopes and dreams through poems, stories, and, eventually, books. Along the way, they experience history in the making: Vietnam, the race for the moon, and a women&#x2019;s movement that challenges everything they have ever thought about themselves, while at the same time supporting one another through changes in their personal lives brought on by infidelity, longing, illness, failure, and success.<br><br> Humorous and moving, The Wednesday Sisters is a literary feast for book lovers that earns a place among those popular works that honor the joyful, mysterious, unbreakable bonds between friends. <br><br><b>BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Meg Waite Clayton&#x2019;s&nbsp;The Wednesday Daughters.</b><br><br><b>Praise for&nbsp;</b><i><b>The Wednesday Sisters</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;This generous and inventive book is a delight to read, an evocation of the power of friendship to sustain, encourage, and embolden us.

We don&#x2019;t even meet on Wednesdays, although we did at the beginning. We met at the swings at Pardee Park on Wednesday mornings when our children were young. It&#x2019;s been thirty-five years, though&#x2014;more than thirty-five!&#x2014;since we switched from Wednesdays at ten to Sundays at dawn.

And going left to right, that&#x2019;s Linda (her hair loose and combed, but then she brought the camera, she was the only one who knew we&#x2019;d be taking a photograph). Next to her is Ally, pale as ever, and then Kath. And the one in the white gloves in front&#x2014;the one in the coffin&#x2014;that&#x2019;s Brett.<br><br>���<br><br>Brett&#x2019;s gloves&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what brought us together all those years ago. I had Maggie and Davy with me in the park that first morning, a park full to bursting with children running around together as if any new kid could join them just by saying hello, with clusters of mothers who might&#x2014;just might&#x2014;be joined with a simple hello as well. It wasn&#x2019;t my park yet, just a park in a neighborhood where Danny and I might live if we moved to the Bay Area, a neighborhood with tree-lined streets and neat little yards and sidewalks and leaves turning colors just like at home in Chicago, crumples of red and gold and pale brown skittering around at the curbs. I was sitting on a bench, Davy in my lap and a book in my hand, keeping one eye on Maggie on the slide while surreptitiously watching the other mothers when this woman&#x2014;Brett, though I didn&#x2019;t know that then&#x2014;sat down on a bench across the playground from me, wearing white gloves. No, we are not of the white-glove generation, not really. Yes, I did wear them to Mass when I was a girl, along with a silly doily on my head, but this was 1967&#x2014;we&#x2019;re talking miniskirts and tie-dyed shirts and platform shoes. Or maybe not tie-dye and platforms yet&#x2014;maybe those came later, just before Izod shirts with the collars up&#x2014;but miniskirts. At any rate, it was definitely not a white-glove time, much less in the park on a Wednesday morning.<br><br>What in the world? I thought. Does this girl think she&#x2019;s Jackie Kennedy? (Thinking &#x201c;girl,&#x201d; yes, but back then it had no attitude in it, no &#x201c;gi-rl.&#x201d;) And I was wondering if she might go with the ramshackle house beyond the playground&#x2014;a sagging white clapboard mansion that had been something in its day, you could see that, with its grandly columned entrance, its still magnificent palm tree, its long, flat spread of lawn&#x2014;when a mother just settling at the far end of my bench said, &#x201c;She wears them all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>Those were Linda&#x2019;s very first words to me: &#x201c;She wears them all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>I don&#x2019;t as a rule gossip about people I&#x2019;ve never met with other people I&#x2019;ve never met, even women like Linda, who, just from the look of her, seemed she&#x2019;d be nice to know. She was blond and fit and . . . well, just Linda, even then wearing a red Stanford baseball cap, big white letters across the front and the longest, thickest blond braid sticking out the back&#x2014;when girls didn&#x2019;t wear baseball caps either, or concern themselves with being fit rather than just plain thin.<br><br>&#x201c;You were staring,&#x201d; Linda said.

She&#x2019;s nothing if not frank.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said, still stuck on that baseball cap of hers, thinking even Gidget never wore a baseball cap, not the Sandra Dee movie version or the Sally Field TV one.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to criticize,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everyone does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Criticize?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stare at her.&#x201d; Linda shifted slightly, and I saw then that she was pregnant, though just barely. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re new to the neighborhood?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No, we . . .&#x201d; I adjusted my cat&#x2019;s-eye glasses, a nervous habit my mom had forever tried to break me of. &#x201c;My husband and I might be moving here after he finishes school.

They showed us that little house there.&#x201d; I indicated the house just across Center Drive from the old mansion. &#x201c;The split-level with the pink shutters?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; Linda said. &#x201c;I thought it just sold, like, yesterday. I didn&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;d moved in!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not sold yet. And we haven&#x2019;t. We won&#x2019;t move here until the spring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She looked a bit confused. &#x201c;Well, you are going to paint the shutters, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>As I said, Linda is nothing if not frank.<br><br>That was the first Wednesday. September 6, 1967.<br><br>When I tell people that&#x2014;that I first came to the Bay Area at the end of that summer, that that&#x2019;s when the Wednesday Sisters first met&#x2014;they inevitably get this look in their eyes that says bell-bottoms and flower power, war protests and race riots, LSD. Even to me, it seems a little improbable in retrospect that I never saw a joint back then, never flashed anyone a peace sign. But I had a three-year-old daughter and a baby son already. I had a husband who&#x2019;d passed the draft age, who would have a Ph.D. and a full-time job within months. I&#x2019;d already settled into the life I&#x2019;d been raised to settle into: dependable daughter, good wife, attentive mother. All the Wednesday Sisters had. We spent the Summer of Love changing diapers, going to the grocery store, baking tuna casseroles and knitting sweater vests (yes, sweater vests), and watching Walter Cronkite from the safety of our family rooms. I watched the local news, too, though that was more about following the Cubs; they&#x2019;d just lost to the Dodgers, ending a three-game winning streak&#x2014;not much, three games, but then they are the Cubs and were even that year, despite Fergie Jenkins throwing 236 strikeouts and Ron Santo hitting 31 out of the park.<br><br>Anyway, I was sitting there watching Maggie on the slide, about to call to her to clear away from the bottom when she did it on her own, and I was just a bit intimidated by this blonde I didn&#x2019;t know yet was Linda, and that occurred to me, that I didn&#x2019;t know her name. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Frankie O&#x2019;Mara,&#x201d; I said, forgetting that I&#x2019;d decided to be Mary, or at least Mary Frances or Frances or Fran, in this new life. I tried to back up and say &#x201c;Mary Frances O&#x2019;Mara&#x201d;&#x2014;it was the way I liked to imagine my name on the cover of a novel someday, not that I would have admitted to dreams beyond marriage and motherhood back then. But Linda was already all over Frankie.<br><br>&#x201c;Frankie? A man&#x2019;s name&#x2014;and you all curvy and feminine. I wish I had curves like you do. I&#x2019;m pretty much just straight up and down.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d have traded my &#x201c;curves&#x201d; of unlost baby gain for what was under her double-knit slacks and striped turtleneck in a second, or I thought I would then. She looked like that girl in the Clairol ads&#x2014;&#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t beat &#x2019;em, join &#x2019;em&#x201d;&#x2014;except she was more &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t join &#x2019;em, beat &#x2019;em&#x201d; somehow. She didn&#x2019;t wear a speck of makeup, either, not even lipstick.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you reading, Frankie?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>(In fairness, I should explain here that Linda remembers that first morning differently. She swears her first words were &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that you&#x2019;re reading?&#x201d; and it was only when I didn&#x2019;t answer&#x2014;too busy staring at Brett to hear her, she says&#x2014;that she said, &#x201c;She wears them all the time.&#x201d; She swears what brought us together was the book in my hand. That&#x2019;s how she and Kath met, too; they got to talking about In Cold Blood at a party while everyone was still slogging through the usual blather about the lovely Palo Alto weather and how lucky they were that their husbands were doing their residencies here.)<br><br>I held up the cover of my book&#x2014;Agatha Christie&#x2019;s latest Poirot novel, The Third Girl&#x2014;for Linda to see. She blinked blond lashes over eyes that had a little of every color in them, like the blue and green and yellow of broken glass all mixed together in the recycling bin.<br><br>&#x201c;A mystery?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>She preferred &#x201c;more serious fiction,&#x201d; she said&#x2014;not unkindly, but still I was left with the impression that she ranked my mysteries right down there with comic books. I was left shifting uncomfortably in my pleated skirt and sweater set, wondering how I&#x2019;d ever manage in a place where even the books I read were all wrong. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine, then, leaving my friends back home, the girls who&#x2019;d shared sleepless slumber-party nights and double dates with me, who still wore my clothes and lipstick and blush. Though it had never been quite the same after we&#x2019;d all married. My Danny had seemed so . . . not awkward, exactly, but uncomfortable with my friends. And they weren&#x2019;t any easier with him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s such a brain,&#x201d; Theresa had said just a few weeks before, and I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;He is, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; with a spanking big grin on my face, I&#x2019;m sure, and it was only the doubt in Theresa&#x2019;s eyes that told me she hadn&#x2019;t meant it as praise. The conversation had left me feeling fat and desolate and drowning in filthy diapers, and when Danny came home from class that same evening talking about a job in California, I said, &#x201c;California? I&#x2019;ve always wanted to see California,&#x201d; at once imagining dinner parties with Danny&#x2019;s co-workers and their wives and weekend picnics at the beach and a whole new set of friends who would never imagine that Danny was one thing and I was another, even if we were.<br><br>Another gal pushed a baby buggy up to our bench just then, a big-haired, big-chinned brunette who had already pulled a book from her bag and was handing it to Linda, saying she&#x2019;d finished it at two that morning. &#x201c;No love story, but I liked it anyway. Thank,&#x201d; she said, her y&#x2019;s clipped, her i&#x2019;s lingering on into forever. Mississippi, I thought, though that was probably because of the book: To Kill a Mockingbird.<br><br>Linda, polite as anything, was introducing us, saying, &#x201c;Kath, this is Frankie . . .&#x201d; Frowning then, clearly drawing a blank on my last name.<br><br>&#x201c;Mary Frances O&#x2019;Mara,&#x201d; I said, remembering this time: Mary Frances or Frances or Fran.<br><br>&#x201c;Frankie is moving into that cute little house with the awful pink shutters,&#x201d; Linda said.<br><br>&#x201c;Linda,&#x201d; Kath said.<br><br>&#x201c;In the spring, right?&#x201d; Linda said.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not that house,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, right. She hasn&#x2019;t bought it yet. But when she does, she&#x2019;s going to paint the shutters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lin-da!&#x201d; Kath blinked heavily darkened lashes straight at her friend&#x2019;s lack of manners. Then to me, &#x201c;You can see why she doesn&#x2019;t have a friend in this whole wide world except me, bless her cold, black heart.&#x201d;<br><br>Kath said how pleased she was meet to me, her head bobbing and her shoulders bobbing along with it, some sort of Southern-girl upper-body dance that said more loudly than she could have imagined that she was an agreeable person, that she just wanted to be liked. I said, &#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; nodding as well, but careful to keep my shoulders straight and square and still; probably I&#x2019;d done a Midwestern version of that head bob all my life.<br><br>Kath began to unpack her baby from the stroller, placing a clean white diaper over the shoulder of her spotless blouse first, the careful pink of her perfect nails&#x2014;the same pink as her lipstick&#x2014;lingering on baby hair as neatly combed as her own, which was poufy at the top and flipping up at the ends the way it does only if you set it, with a big fat braid wrapped above her bangs like a headband. Not a real braid like Linda&#x2019;s, but a fake one exactly the color of her hair. Still, it was easy to imagine that she slept propped up on pillows so her hair in big rollers would dry through, and that when it rained her hair might revert to disaster like mine did, even when it didn&#x2019;t get wet. She wasn&#x2019;t like my girlfriends back home, exactly, but she was more like them than Linda was. Not Twiggy thin. Not Doris Day blond.<br><br>Although Linda had lent Kath To Kill a Mockingbird. There was that.<br><br>&#x201c;How old?&#x201d; I asked Kath, glancing down at my own three-month-old Davy.<br><br>&#x201c;This punkin?&#x201d; Kath said, admiring her little Lacy. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s three months. My Lee-Lee&#x2014;Madison Leland Montgomery the Fifth, he is really&#x2014;he&#x2019;s three and a half. And Anna Page&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>A young girl with Kath&#x2019;s same chin, her same chestnut hair left alone to fall in its own random waves under a straw hat with a black grosgrain band, tore off across the park, the hat flying back off her head, tumbling into the sand behind her. She tripped and slid in the sand herself, and her dress (this smocked thing with white lace at the cuffs and neck) . . . well, you could see she was not a girl who kept her dresses clean. But she picked herself up without so much as a pout and continued on to the jungle gym, where she climbed to the top cross bar and hung upside down, her sandy dress falling over her face.<br><br>&#x201c;I swear, she&#x2019;ll be drinking bourbon straight out of the bottle before she&#x2019;s eighteen,&#x201d; Kath said.<br><br>Linda asked Kath who was coming to her Miss America party that Saturday night, then, and they started talking together about the other doctors&#x2019; wives they&#x2019;d met&#x2014;or the residents&#x2019; wives, to be precise. Kath had grown up in Louisville, Kentucky, and Linda in Connecticut. They&#x2019;d both just moved to Palo Alto. They didn&#x2019;t know any more people than I did, really. But they&#x2019;d spent every Miss America Saturday they could remember gathering with their girlfriends to watch the pageant, like I had, all of us imagining taking that victory walk ourselves even if we were the homeliest things in town. Or Kath had always watched with her girlfriends, anyway, and Linda left the impression she had, too. She didn&#x2019;t say anything that first afternoon about how lonely her childhood had been.</p><h2>The True Story of the Great Escape: Stalag Luft III, March 1944</h2><p>'It shows the variety and depth of the men sent into harms way during World War II, something emphasized by the population of Stalag Luft III. Most of the Allied POWs were flyers, with all the technical, tactical and planning skills that profession requires. Such men are independent thinkers, craving open air and wide-open spaces, which meant than an obsession with escape was almost inevitable' - John D Gresham<br><br>Between dusk and dawn on the night of March 24th - 25th 1944, a small army of Allied soldiers crawled through tunnels in Germany in a covert operation the likes of which the Third Reich had never seen before.<br><br>The prison break from Stalag Luft III in eastern Germany was the largest of its kind in World War II. Seventy-nine Allied soldiers and airmen made it outside the wire - but only three made it outside Nazi Germany. Fifty were executed by the Gestapo.<br><br>Jonathan Vance tells the incredible story that was made famous by the 1963 film, The Great Escape. The escape is a classic tale of prisoners and their wardens in a battle of wits and wills. The brilliantly conceived escape plan is overshadowed only by the colorful, daring (and sometimes very funny) crew who executed it - literally under the noses of German guards.<br><br>From their first days in Stalag Luft III and the forming of bonds key to such exploits, to the tunnel building, amazing escape and eventual capture, Vance's history is a vivid, compelling look at one of the greatest 'exfiltration' missions of all time.</p><p>Professor Jonathan Vance teaches military history and Canadian history at Western University, Canada.

Unlike Joey-Mick, Maggie doesn&#x2019;t play baseball&#x2014;but at almost ten years old, she is a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Maggie can recite all the players&#x2019; statistics and understands the subtleties of the game. Unfortunately, Jim Maine is a Giants fan, but it&#x2019;s Jim who teaches Maggie the fine art of scoring a baseball game. Not only can she revisit every play of every inning, but by keeping score she feels she&#x2019;s more than just a fan: she&#x2019;s helping her team. </p><p>Jim is drafted into the army and sent to Korea, and although Maggie writes to him often, his silence is just one of a string of disappointments&#x2014;being a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in the early 1950s meant season after season of near misses and year after year of dashed hopes. But Maggie goes on trying to help the Dodgers, and when she finds out that Jim needs help, too, she&#x2019;s determined to provide it. Against a background of major league baseball and the Korean War on the home front, Maggie looks for, and finds, a way to make a difference. </p><p>Even those readers who think they don&#x2019;t care about baseball will be drawn into the world of the true and ardent fan. Linda Sue Park&#x2019;s captivating story will, of course, delight those who are already keeping score.</p></p><p><p><b>Linda Sue Park </b>is the author of bestseller <i>A Long Walk to Water&nbsp;</i>as well as the Newbery Medal book <i>A Single Shard</i>&nbsp;and many other acclaimed novels and picture books.&nbsp;She lives in Rochester, NY. www.lspark.com,Twitter: @LindaSuePark.</p><p>July, 1951 Brooklyn, NY</p> <p>Chapter One: The New Guy &#x201c;How&#x2019;s come you guys don&#x2019;t bunt?&#x201d; Maggie was sitting on the stoop. On the sidewalk in front of their house, Joey-Mick finished tying his shoe with a double knot. He shrugged but didn&#x2019;t answer.</p> <p>Then he picked up his glove and glared at it. He tightened the worn leather lace that was always coming undone, and prodded the hole in the top of one of the fingers. The glove was a hand-me-down from their Uncle Leo, and the only reason it was still in one piece, Maggie thought, was because it didn&#x2019;t want to face her brother&#x2019;s wrath if it fell apart. &#x201c;They bunt all the time in the majors,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;Well, not all the time, but when they need to. Nobody on your team bunts, hardly never. Don&#x2019;t they teach you how?&#x201d; &#x201c;We know how,&#x201d; he said as he started plunking a ball into the pocket of the glove&#x2014;thunk &#x2013; thunk &#x2013; thunk. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s lots more important to get good at hitting.&#x201d; He stopped plunking long enough to tug at the bill of his cap; Maggie thought that the cap over his new crewcut made him look like he didn&#x2019;t have any hair at all. &#x201c;If you played, you wouldn&#x2019;t hafta ask that.&#x201d; Maggie pressed her lips together hard.</p> <p>Whenever she tried to talk baseball with Joey-Mick, he always used that older-so-I-know-way-more-than-you voice and said she didn&#x2019;t or wouldn&#x2019;t or couldn&#x2019;t understand because she didn&#x2019;t play the game herself.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t fair. She was nine-going-on-ten, and she knew plenty about baseball, and way more about the Dodgers than he did. Unless she was in school, she never missed a game on the radio. Joey-Mick might go out to play with his friends during a game, but not Maggie. Like today. The Dodgers&#x2019; game against the Pittsburgh Pirates would be starting soon, and here was Joey-Mick waiting for his friend Davey; they were going to the park to have a catch. Maggie stood up. She was leaving as well, to walk the two blocks to the firehouse and listen to the game with the guys.</p> <p>&#x201c;Gotta go,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Us real fans have a game to listen to.&#x201d;</p> <p>New York was the only city in the whole country with three baseball teams. The Yankees of the American League were the winningest team in all of baseball. They had been World Series champions a whopping thirteen times. And the National League Giants had won the World Series seven times in their history.</p> <p>The Brooklyn Dodgers, who were in the National League with the Giants, had never won the World Series. Not ever.</p> <p>Not even once.</p> <p>It was what Maggie wanted more than anything in the world: for the Dodgers to win the World Series. It seemed like she had wanted it ever since she was born. Every year the Dodgers&#x2014;whose nickname to Brooklynites was &#x2018;Dem Bums&#x2019;&#x2014;came close, either winning the National League pennant or finishing in the top three. But the biggest prize, the World Series championship, always seemed to slip away from them. Although Maggie knew it wasn&#x2019;t true, she felt like the first words she had learned when she was a baby were &#x201c;Wait till next year!&#x201d;&#x2014;the unofficial official slogan of Dodgers fans.</p> <p>Charcoal, the mostly-black firehouse dog, always knew when Maggie was coming, and she knew he knew, so even before she saw him, she took from her pocket a folded paper napkin that held a half-slice of salami. When he bounded down the street to meet her, she was ready.</p> <p>She held out the salami, which he snapped down without chewing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Charky! Where are your manners?&#x201d; she said, shaking her head and smiling at the same time. The dog led the way to the firehouse, where the guys were sitting out front in folding chairs, boots and suspenders and toothpicks, with the radio already tuned to the broadcast of the game. As soon as George caught sight of her, he jumped to his feet and went and got another chair.</p> <p>After greetings, they all settled in to listen, Charky flopping down at Maggie&#x2019;s feet. A routine, but one she never got tired of.</p> <p>The call came in at a crucial moment: The Dodgers had just tied the game.</p> <p>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t be long, Maggie-o,&#x201d; George said as he opened the door on the driver&#x2019;s side of the wagon and waited while Charky bounded onto the seat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t sound like anything serious.</p> <p>You better get that lead and keep it for us.&#x201d; &#x201c;I will,&#x201d; Maggie promised, and stepped to the side of the bay to get out of the way. &#x201c;Stay cool,&#x201d; she called out as George hopped into the wagon.</p> <p>Whenever Dad left the house to go to work, Maggie and Joey-Mick always told him to &#x2018;stay cool&#x2019;. It came from something he often said to them: &#x201c;When things get hot, you gotta stay cool.&#x201d; During Dad&#x2019;s firehouse days, Maggie would get sent home if an emergency calll came in. But now she didn&#x2019;t have to leave when the guys went out on a job. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in charge,&#x201d; George had said the first time she stayed. Which had made her feel quite important. She watched until the wagon was out of sight, then walked over to the radio attttt the side of the bay and turned up the volume so she could hear it while she worked. George was very strict about keeping the firehouse tidy. He had learned it from Maggie&#x2019;s dad, how keeping the whole place neat and organized could save precious time in an emergency. Most days at the firehouse when there weren&#x2019;t any calls, the guys spent a lot of time cleaning. Today Maggie planned to surprise them by sweeping up while they were out.</p> <p>Dad had been a fireman at this station until three years ago. One afternoon when Maggie was six, Mom answered a knock at the door. Two cops were on the stoop. There had been a fire, and Dad was hurt. They didn&#x2019;t know how bad. Maggie could still remember every detail of that ride to the hospital, the dome light flashing and the siren shrieking and Mom holding her hand tight enough that it hurt. They saw Dad for a few moments before the operation to fix his leg, his face so black with soot that you couldn&#x2019;t tell where the soot ended and his hair and mustache began, and when he smiled at them his teeth looked the whitest they had ever been&#x2014;smiled even though the pain must have been too awful to imagine. And he said, &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t none of yous worried, were ya?&#x201d; Maggie had seen the tears tracking down her mother&#x2019;s face as she cleared her throat and answered, &#x201c;Pish, I couldn&#x2019;t be bothered. I was getting the dinner, and it&#x2019;ll be gone cold now, thank you very much.&#x201d; They were clustered around his hospital bed when he woke up from the operation.</p> <p>&#x201c;Everybody staying cool?&#x201d; he asked groggily, the first words out of his mouth.</p> <p>Later he told them a little more about what had happened. &#x201c;I went crashin&#x2019; through the floor, right? And when I got my wits back, I got down low, where the air was a little better, and I started crawling. Every inch I crawled I tried to think about something cool. Maggie eating ice cream, Joey-Mick hosing down the wagon, your mom on our honeymoon at Jones Beach&#x2014;&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so cool about that?&#x201d; Joey-Mick asked.</p> <p>Dad winked. &#x201c;&#x2014;in her bathing suit&#x2014;&#x201d; &#x201c;Joseph!&#x201d; Maggie&#x2019;s mom put one hand to her mouth, half annoyed and half laughing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t help it, Rosie, it&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201d; And staying cool had helped Dad save his own life, and maybe George&#x2019;s and Vince&#x2019;s too, for even with a shattered leg he managed to crawl as far as the door where the other guys found him and dragged him out just as the whole roof collapsed. If he hadn&#x2019;t made it to the door on his own, all three of them might have died inside.</p> <p>&#x201c;Some guys would hate it,&#x201d; George had said to Maggie when Dad was reassigned to a desk job. &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t stand being at a desk, they&#x2019;d sorta dry up and&#x2014;and shrivel away. But not your pop.</p> <p>&#x2018;Cause he loves the department, see.</p> <p>Really loves it.&#x201d; Maggie knew without asking that Mom was glad not to have to worry about Dad on the job anymore. But she also knew that he missed being at the firehouse. It was one of the reasons she still went there.</p> <p>&#x201c;Told ya,&#x201d; George said to Terry. &#x201c;Told ya she&#x2019;d get the lead for us.&#x201d; The guys were back. As George had predicted, the call had been an easy one, nothing but smolder by the time they got there. Garbage in an alley had caught fire from a carelessly-tossed cigarette butt. The owner of the shop next door had telephoned for help first, and then gone out with a bucket of water and doused the fire himself. The guys had helped clean up the alley and cautioned the shop owner not to let trash pile up like that again. Maggie made a tiny gesture that no one else could see, moving her forefinger against her thumb in the Sign of the Cross. She always did that when the guys came back safe.</p> <p>George took off his helmet. He ran his hand over his head the way he often did; the other guys always said he was making sure he still had some hair left. It might have been true, but Maggie liked how his hair receded in a curve; it looked like a smile.</p> <p>&#x201c;Terry said we were gonna lose the game,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;He said sure, we got it tied up, but that would be it for us, and the Pirates would come back and score.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey, it was a good guess,&#x201d; Terry said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Happened twice in the past week.&#x201d; Blond and stocky, he stood in front of Maggie so she could snap his suspender straps against his ample belly. She didn&#x2019;t remember how this ritual had gotten started, but she had been snapping his straps for ages now. Whenever he got back from a call.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, but you know what I said,&#x201d; George answered. &#x201c;I said, we left Maggie-o in charge, she&#x2019;s gonna take care of everything. And look&#x2014;&#x201d; he waved his arm broadly&#x2014;&#x201c;she got the place swept up too!&#x201d; &#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d; Terry asked eagerly. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d they do it?&#x201d; Maggie explained: how Brooklyn had scored three runs in the top of the sixth inning to go ahead 7-4 and one more in the top of the ninth, and how the Pirates had been held scoreless for the whole rest of the game.</p> <p>&#x201c;How many&#x2019;d he strike out?&#x201d; Terry asked. &#x201c;He got six before we left&#x2014;he get any more?&#x201d; Maggie knew who Terry was asking about: Preacher Roe, the pitcher.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He got&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped, frowning. At least one more, she knew that for sure. But had there been another one? Or maybe even two? Or was she getting it mixed up with the earlier innings?</p> <p>Terry waved away her hesitation. &#x201c;S&#x2019;ok, Maggie-o. I can find out tomorrow.&#x201d; &#x201c;I think maybe two,&#x201d; Maggie said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Anyway, he was pitching really good.&#x201d; &#x201c;Musta been, seeing how they didn&#x2019;t score any more.&#x201d; The talk about the game continued until it became talk about the season and the team, other teams, other players, and especially, dreams of future glory, the way it always did.</p> <p>On the walk home, Maggie went over the game again in her head. Why couldn&#x2019;t she remember how many strikeouts Preacher Roe had gotten? She knew he was Terry&#x2019;s favorite player; she should have been paying more attention. But no matter what Joey-Mick thought, she didn&#x2019;t believe that playing the game herself would make any difference&#x2014;would help her remember any better.</p> <p>The thing was, Maggie didn&#x2019;t want to play baseball. Not because it was a boy thing&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t anymore. There had been a real league for women during the war and Maggie&#x2019;s best friend, Treecie, had once said that if they had the chance, girls could do anything boys could do&#x2014;&#x201c;except pee standing up.&#x201d; Maggie had laughed in both shock and admiration; she couldn&#x2019;t even think of things like that, much less bring herself to say them.</p> <p>To Maggie, being a fan was a whole separate thing from playing the game yourself. Joey-Mick might be able to tell you that Carl Furillo&#x2019;s batting average was around .300 and that Don Newcombe had won most of his games so far. But Maggie had it down cold: Furillo was batting .304 and the Newk had six wins.</p> <p>It was like the movies. You could go to the pictures every week, know all about the stars, read everything in the magazines&#x2014;and still not want to be an actress yourself. Maggie&#x2019;s mother, Rose, was like that. She had told Maggie that when she first came to New York from Ireland, she went to the pictures every chance she got, &#x201c;sometimes three or four in a week!&#x201d; Mom was kind of solid around her middle now, with a few streaks of gray in her hair that Dad sometimes teased her about&#x2014;his own hair being jet black&#x2014;but her eyes were as blue as a calm sky, and her skin so clear that her face always looked like she had just washed it.</p> <p>Maggie could imagine a much younger Rose getting dressed up and going out for a good time.</p> <p>Baseball and the Dodgers were even bigger than the movies. You had to go to the movie theater to see a picture, but the radio, with announcer Red Barber, brought the Bums right into Maggie&#x2019;s home. Into her street too, so Maggie didn&#x2019;t mind running errands during a game. She would walk past the row of houses that looked just like hers, all built of dull brownish-yellow brick, one window downstairs, two windows up&#x2014;to Pinky the butcher, or Mr. and Mrs. Floyd at the bakery, or the drugstore, and she wouldn&#x2019;t miss a single pitch. Everyone would have their radios on, the sound of the game trailing in and out of each doorway like a long thread that tied the whole neighborhood together.</p> <p>The thread almost always led Maggie to the firehouse, her second home. When she and Joey-Mick were younger, they would stop by often to visit Dad. He would give them little jobs to do. And with all the guys there, it was like having a bunch of favorite uncles to joke around with anytime you wanted. They had spoiled her with piggyback rides and Hershey bars and George gave her a bite of his sandwich, so that over the years, Maggie had developed a ferocious love for horseradish.</p> <p>He would hold out the sandwich; she would lean over and bite into it.</p> <p>Sometimes it was messy, like when her bite dislodged a whole slice of tomato and it sort of dangled from her mouth until she managed to wolf it down. One time she even pulled out all the ham, leaving behind two empty pieces of bread. George had pretended to be mad at her that time; she was only six then, and for a few moments she had been scared that he really was mad&#x2014;until he laughed.</p> <p>But best of all were the Dodgers games.</p> <p>Listening to the games and talking to the guys about baseball, it never mattered one bit that she was a girl who didn&#x2019;t play ball herself.</p> <p>A few days after the Pirates game, Maggie headed for the firehouse again.</p> <p>As she drew near, she cocked her head a little. She could hear the radio as usual, but Red Barber&#x2019;s voice was being drowned out by the sound of boos and jeering. What was going on? Had Philadelphia scored? That couldn&#x2019;t be, it was Brooklyn&#x2019;s turn to bat . . . .</p> <p>Terry and Vince and George were up out of their chairs, booing and hissing and jostling a fourth man, someone she didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;New guy?&#x201d; Maggie murmured to Charky, who had loped out to meet her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, Maggie-o!&#x201d; George called out.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just in time&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not gonna believe this&#x2014;&#x201d; He pointed in a big exaggerated motion at the new guy.</p> <p>Maggie saw that the new guy was built like her dad. Maybe not big all over the way her dad was, but tall and not skinny&#x2014;lots of muscles. A flat-top haircut. Dressed like the rest of them in blue. Younger than George, nice brown eyes. Then Maggie saw what George was really pointing at: the radio at the new guy&#x2019;s feet. Not the firehouse&#x2019;s usual radio, which stood where it always did, at one side of the bay doors, but a smaller, newer one.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wh...</p></p><h2>Conducting -- A Hands-On Approach: Book &amp; Online Audio</h2><p>This comprehensive text by Anthony Maiello on the art of conducting is designed to be hands on, user friendly, playable by any instrumentation, a step-by-step approach to baton technique, great for use with a wind, string or voice conducting class, and excellent as a refresher course for all conductors at all levels of ability.

But There Is Help . . . If We Listen.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the middle of the night on August 2, 2016, Neale Donald Walsch found himself drawn into a new and totally unexpected dialogue with God in which he suddenly faced two questions:</p> <p><i>Is the human race being offered help by</i></p> <p><i>Highly Evolved Beings from Another Dimension?</i></p> <p>Is there a key role that humans are being invited to play in advancing their own evolution by joining in a mutual mission to assist the planet during the critical times ahead?</p> <p>He was told that the answer to both questions is yes.</p> <p>Then he was given 16 specific examples of how Highly Evolved Beings respond to life differently than humans do&#x2015;and how adopting even a few of those behaviors<i> </i>could change the course of world history for the better forever.</p> <p>That information makes up the body of this work.&nbsp;</p> <p>A striking invitation to every reader sets the stage for the extraordinary explorations that follow. Picking up where Book 3 in the <i>Conversations with God</i> Trilogy series left off, the revelations about Highly Evolved Beings and about how ordinary humans can answer the call to help <i>awaken the species </i>on Earth will breathtakingly expand your view of both your personal and your collective future.</p> <p></p> <p>Which is exactly what the dialogue was intended to do.</p></p><p><p><strong>Author's Note<br><br></strong>I am aware that in the most recent book in the&nbsp;<em><strong>Conversations with God</strong>&nbsp;</em>series--<strong><em>Home with God in a Life That Never Ends</em></strong>, written and published ten years prior to this writing--it was indicated that it would be the final of these dialogues to be published and widely distributed by me. Yet life is an ever-changing mosaic, and given that all of us are One with God, we do have the ability to create what filmmakers would call an "alternate ending" to any story. Apparently, this is what has happened here. A new decision appears to have been made at a Superconscious level (the level at which all souls function).<br><br>I could have kept this dialogue private, but everything within me shouted, "Don't you dare." With this public distribution of a new word-for-word transcription of my most recent conversation with God, I feel that I am making a promise to God to do whatever I might be able to continue to place into the world the most important information I have ever been given--information that, it has been demonstrated to me, can change in a positive way the daily experience of millions of people around the world.<br><br>Notwithstanding the face that all of the world's major religions speak of divine revelation from God to humans as having occured throughout history, I perfectly well understand it if some people feel that such a blessed event would presumably not occur in the life of an utterly imperfect and fault-ridden person such as myself. I have always said, however, that it is not me, in the singular, who has conversations with God, but all of us, in the plural, all the time. Most people are simply calling it something else.<br><br>All of us have the ability to access the source of highest wisdom within us--which we are invited to consider to be God working in and through us. The dialogue itself puts this succinctly, in the voice of The Divine: "I talk to everyone all the time. The question is not,&nbsp;<em><strong>To whom do I talk?</strong>&nbsp;</em>The question is,&nbsp;<em><strong>Who listens?</strong><br><br></em>I therefore invite you to set aside whatever natural skepticism may arise regarding the source of the information found here, and to focus instead on whether or not what has been offered in this process has any value in the living of your individual life, and, more broadly, in the understanding of Life itself.<br><br>This text contains much information about life and death--and the time in between. It is filled with probably more metaphysical data than you may have been exposed to in one place in a very long time. At one point in the dialogue that follows, you may find yourself saying, "Speculation or fact, this is utterly fascinating," yet then fairly be asking, "but what good is knowing all of this? What does it have to do with my life, and the improving of it--much less the improving of the lives of all of us on Earth?"<br><br>You will see here that I asked question after question in my own effort to render this dialogue meaningful and relevant. What I know is that today, with everything that's going on in the world, people are yearning and searching for a message of hope, faith, healing, and change. I found that this latest conversation with God offered me that, and this is why I let myself publicly share it. The exchange here contains a few tough assessments of where we are today, yet these are offered not as judgments, but as flashlights, illuminating what we are now being invited to see and empowered to do.<br><br>I know it sounds trite, but a Better Tomorrow for us as individuals and for our civiliation is possible. Very,&nbsp;<em>very</em> possible, if we will choose it. As the dialogue here makes clear, we are but One Decision away. I hope you'll decide to make that decision after reading what follows.</p><p><strong>NEALE DONALD WALSCH </strong>is the author of nine books in the <em>Conversations with God </em>series, which have sold over ten million copies in 37 languages.

What used to be the Other, be it as friend, as Eros or as hell, is now indistinguishable from the self in our narcissistic desire to assimilate everything and everyone until there are no boundaries left. The result is a 'terror of the Same', lives in which we no longer pursue knowledge, insight and experience but are instead reduced to the echo chambers and illusory encounters offered by social media. In extreme cases, this feeling of disorientation and senselessness is compensated through self-harm, or even harming others through acts of terrorism.&nbsp;<br><br>Byung-Chul Han argues that our times are characterized not by external repression but by an internal depression, whereby the destructive pressure comes not from the Other but from the self. It is only by returning to a society of listeners and lovers, by acknowledging and desiring the Other, that we can seek to overcome the isolation and suffering caused by this crushing process of total assimilation.</p></p><p><b>Byung-Chul Han</b> is a Korean-born Professor of Philosophy and Cultural Studies who teaches at the University of the Arts (UdK) in Berlin. He is the author of more than twenty books including <i>The Scent of Time, Saving Beauty</i> and <i>The Burnout Society.</i>"No other philosophical author today has gone further than Byung-Chul Han in the analysis of our global everyday existence under the challenges of electronically induced hyper-communication. His latest - and again eminently readable - book concentrates on the "Terror of Sameness", that is on a life without events and individual otherness, as an environment to which we react with depression. What makes the intellectual difference in this analysis of sameness is the mastery with which Han brings into play the classics of our philosophical tradition and, through them, historical worlds that provide us with horizons of existential otherness."<br><b>Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Albert Gu�rard Professor in Literature, Stanford University<br><br></b>"The new star of German philosophy."<b><br>El Pa�s<br><br></b>"<i>The Expulsion of the Other</i> has the classic Byung-Chul Han 'sound,' an evocative tone which&nbsp;powerfully draws the reader in. ...

The boardroom was a vast space, perhaps fifty by seventy feet. It was an oppressive space, loaded with desks, telephones, computer monitors, and some very obnoxious yuppies, seventy of them in all. They had their suit jackets off, and at this hour of morning&#x2013;9:20 a.m.&#x2013;they were leaning back in their seats, reading their&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>s, and congratulating themselves on being young Masters of the Universe.<br><br> Being a Master of the Universe; it seemed like a noble pursuit, and as I walked past the Masters, in my cheap blue suit and clodhopper shoes, I found myself wishing I were one of them. But my new boss was quick to remind me that I wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Your&nbsp;<i>job</i>&#x201d;&#x2013;he looked at the plastic nametag on my cheap blue lapel&#x2013;&#x201c;Jordan Belfort, is a&nbsp;<i>connector,&nbsp;</i>which means you&#x2019;ll be dialing the phone five hundred times a day, trying to get past secretaries. You&#x2019;re not trying to sell anything or recommend anything or create anything. You&#x2019; re just trying to get business owners on the phone.&#x201d; He paused for a brief instant, then spewed out more venom. &#x201c;And when you&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>get one on the phone, all you&#x2019;ll say is: &#x2018;Hello, Mr. So and So, I have Scott holding for you,&#x2019; and then you pass the phone to me and start dialing again. Think you can handle that, or is that too complicated for you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, I can handle it,&#x201d; I said confidently, as a wave of panic overtook me like a killer tsunami. The LF Rothschild training program was six months long. They would be tough months,&nbsp;<i>grueling</i>&nbsp;months, during which I would be at the very mercy of assholes like Scott, the yuppie scumbag who seemed to have bubbled up from the fiery depths of yuppie hell.<br><br> Sneaking peaks at him out of the corner of my eye, I came to the quick conclusion that Scott looked like a goldfish. He was bald and pale, and what little hair he did have left was a muddy orange. He was in his early thirties, on the tall side, and he had a narrow skull and pink, puffy lips. He wore a bow tie, which made him look ridiculous. Over his bulging brown eyeballs he wore a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles, which made him look fishy&#x2013;in the goldfish sense of the word.<br><br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said the scumbag goldfish. &#x201c;Now, here are the ground rules: There are no breaks, no personal calls, no sick days, no coming in late, and no loafing off. You get thirty minutes for lunch&#x201d;&#x2013;he paused for effect&#x2013;&#x201c;and you better be back on time, because there are fifty people waiting to take your desk if you fuck up.&#x201d; He kept walking and talking as I followed one step behind, mesmerized by the thousands of orange diode stock quotes that came skidding across gray-colored computer monitors. At the front of the room, a wall of plate glass looked out over midtown Manhattan. Up ahead I could see the Empire State Building. It towered above everything, seeming to rise up to the heavens and scrape the sky. It was a sight to behold, a sight worthy of a young Master of the Universe. And, right now, that goal seemed further and further away.<br><br> &#x201c;To tell you the truth,&#x201d; sputtered Scott, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re cut out for this job. You look like a kid, and Wall Street&#x2019;s no place for kids. It&#x2019;s a place for killers. A place for mercenaries. So in&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;sense you&#x2019;re lucky I&#x2019;m not the one who does the hiring around here.&#x201d; He let out a few ironic chuckles.<br> <b><br> </b>I bit my lip and said nothing. The year was 1987, and yuppie assholes<b>&nbsp;</b>like Scott seemed to rule the world. Wall Street was in the<b>&nbsp;</b>midst of a raging bull market, and freshly minted millionaires were<b>&nbsp;</b>being spit out a dime a dozen. Money was cheap, and a guy named<b>&nbsp;</b>Michael Milken had invented something called &#x201c;junk bonds,&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;</b>which had changed the way corporate America went about its<b>&nbsp;</b>business. It was a time of unbridled greed, a time of wanton excess.<b>&nbsp;</b>It was the era of the yuppie.<b><br> </b><br> As we neared his desk, my yuppie nemesis turned to me and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll say it again, Jordan: You&#x2019;re the lowest of the low. You&#x2019;re not even a cold caller yet; you&#x2019;re a&nbsp;<i>connector.</i>&#x201d; Disdain dripped off the very word. &#x201c;And &#x2019;til you pass your Series Seven, connecting will be your entire universe. And&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>is why you are lower than pond scum. You got a problem with that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Absolutely not,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the perfect job for me, because I&nbsp;<i>am&nbsp;</i>lower than pond scum.&#x201d; I shrugged innocently.<br><br> Unlike Scott, I don&#x2019;t look like a goldfish, which made me feel proud as he stared at me, searching my face for irony. I&#x2019;m on the short side, though, and at the age of twenty-four I still had the soft boyish features of an adolescent. It was the sort of face that made it difficult for me to get into a bar without getting proofed. I had a full head of light brown hair, smooth olive skin, and a pair of big blue eyes. Not altogether bad-looking.<br><br> But, alas, I hadn&#x2019;t been lying to Scott when I&#x2019;d told him that I felt lower than pond scum. In point of fact, I did. The problem was that I had just run my first business venture into the ground, and my self-esteem had been run into the ground with it. It had been an ill-conceived venture into the meat and seafood industry, and by the time it was over I had found myself on the ass end of twenty-six truck leases&#x2013;all of which I&#x2019;d personally guaranteed, and all of which were now in default. So the banks were after me, as was some belligerent woman from American Express&#x2013;a bearded, three-hundred-pounder by the sound of her&#x2013;who was threatening to personally kick my ass if I didn&#x2019;t pay up. I had considered changing my phone number, but I was so far behind on my phone bill that NYNEX was after me too.<br><br> We reached Scott&#x2019; s desk and he offered me the seat next to his, along with some kind words of encouragement. &#x201c;Look at the bright side,&#x201d; he quipped. &#x201c;If by some miracle you don&#x2019;t get fired for laziness, stupidness, insolence, or tardiness, then you migt actually become a stockbroker one day.&#x201d; He smirked at his own humor. &#x201c;And just so you know, last year I made over three hundred thousand dollars, and the other guy you&#x2019;ll be working for made over a million.&#x201d;<br><br> Over a million? I could only imagine what an asshole the&nbsp;<i>other&nbsp;</i>guy was. With a sinking heart, I asked, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the other guy?&#x201d;<i><br> </i><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked my yuppie tormentor. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it to you?&#x201d;<br><br> Sweet Jesus! I thought. Only speak when spoken to, you nincompoop! It was like being in the Marines. In fact, I was getting the distinct impression that this bastard&#x2019;s favorite movie was&nbsp;<i>An</i>&nbsp;<i>Officer and a Gentleman,&nbsp;</i>and he was playing out a Lou Gossett fantasy on me&#x2013;pretending he was a drill sergeant in charge of a substandard Marine. But I kept that thought to myself, and all I said was, &#x201c;Uh, nothing, I was just, uh, curious.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;His name is Mark Hanna, and you&#x2019;ll meet him soon enough.&#x201d;<br><br> With that, he handed me a stack of three-by-five index cards, each of them having the name and phone number of a wealthy business owner on it. &#x201c;Smile and dial,&#x201d; he instructed, &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t pick up your fucking head &#x2019;til twelve.&#x201d; Then he sat down at his own desk, picked up a copy of&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal,&nbsp;</i>and put his black crocodile dress shoes on the desktop and started reading.</p><h2>Seasons of Wool Appliqu� Folk Art: Celebrate Americana with 12 Projects to Stitch</h2><p>The author of best-selling Wool Appliqu� Folk Art presents a treasure trove of 12 seasonal wool appliqu� projects, with 3 for each season. Presented in a lovely antique color palette, these simple and elegant projects include a journal cover, pillow cover, wallhangings, storage boxes, table rug, and more, perfect for your home or to give as gifts. Includes a basics chapter and an updated chapter on the collection, storage, and use of wool.</p><p>Rebekah L. Smith studied graphic design at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and specializes in wool work, murals, and American folk art. Rebekah and her husband, along with their three daughters, continually work to restore an 1838 house in Ohio.Lovely designs, lovely stitching, good projects from cushions, notebook cover, pegbag, scissor holder to table runner, nothing too imaginative but all done to a good standard with pleasant motifs. One thing to remember is that wool comes in many colours and you can dye your own because the first thing that strikes me about this book is that it is brown. Rebekah has chosen a limited, muted palette. On the back cover two cushions are shown, one dull green with a brown squirrel, the other orange with a brown bird. Just think what a happier guy that squirrel would have been if he were rusty orange. All the projects can be seen at the beginning of the book, and there's that overall brown-ness. As we are going through the seasons, you might imagine a palette of colour to match the seasons but that only seems to be evoked by a touch of orange in autumn. I like the pegbag, my mother used to have one, and if you adjust the pattern slightly, it could be any sort of bag you want. Some of the photos are a tad on the dark side. Each of the 12 projects is shown with details, introduced with a paragraph or two, and contain instructions to make the projects. There is a short guide to preparing wool and embroidery stitches at the back of the book. Included are 2 pages of pattern templates, these are double sided. I love the birds. (<i>yarnsandfabrics.co.uk, 6/19/2017</i>)<br><br>This book would be a lovely introduction to hand embroidery techniques and the &#x2018;folkie' theme is currently popular for interiors. Yes, it's a project book but one with attractive and useful &#x2018;makes' that are described clearly in step photos and diagrams.The book is divided into seasons but, as the colour scheme is much the same throughout, it is just the motifs that change. The photography is good and full-sized patterns are included. Preparation, cutting-out and a very good guide to simple stitches would really encourage a newcomer to make something really lovely.

Douglas argues that this view of Black sexuality has interfered with constructive responses to the AIDS crisis and teenage pregnancies, fostered intolerance of sexual diversity, frustrated healthy male/female relationships, and rendered Black and womanist theologians silent on sexual issues.</p><p><b>Rev. Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas</b> is Canon Theologian at the Washington National Cathedral and Director of the Religion Program at Goucher College, Baltimore, MD, where she holds the Susan D. Morgan Professorship of Religion. Prior to coming to Goucher College she was Associate Professor of Theology at Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, DC, and served as Assistant Professor of Religion at Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, FL.<br><br>A native of Dayton, OH, Dr. Douglas was ordained in 1985 at Saint Margaret's Episcopal Church --the first black woman to be ordained an Episcopal priest in the Southern Ohio Diocese, and one of only five nationwide at the time. In 2012 she was the first to receive the Anna Julia Cooper Award by the Union of Black Episcopalians for her "literary boldness and leadership in the development of a womanist theology and discussing the complexities of Christian faith in African-American contexts." <i>Essence</i> magazine counts her "among this country's most distinguished religious thinkers, teachers, ministers, and counselors."<br><br>She is widely published in national and international journals. Her other books include <i>The Black Christ, What's Faith Got to Do with It?</i> (both from Orbis Books) as well as <i>Black Bodies/Christian Souls</i>, and <i>Black Bodies and the Black Church: A Blues Slant.</i> She is also co-editor of <i>Sexuality and the Sacred: Sources for Theological Reflection.</i>This book probes the conundrum of black sexuality, especially as it relates to black theological silence about sexuality. Douglas aims to understand why sexuality in general has been a "taboo" subject for the black church and community, attempts to advance "womanist" discourse on black sexuality, and seeks to promote theological discourse that might nurture healthier attitudes and behaviors toward sexually related concerns, especially homophobia/ heterosexism. Douglas, an Episcopal minister and associate professor of theology at Howard University Divinity School, is also the author of The Black Christ (Orbis, 1994). Her discussion offers food for thought. While readers may not concur with some of her broad conclusions, they will likely appreciate the deepened discourse.

Perhaps it is a cabin, or a campsite, or a favorite hiking trail. For Sigurd Olson it was a bare glaciated spit of rock in the magnificent Quetico-Superior country of northern Minnesota. He called it his Listening Point, and it is at the center of his book of the same name.<p>Listening Point is Olson's second book, with over 40,000 copies sold in hardcover. Strikingly illustrated with drawings by Francis Lee Jaques, this book tells the story of Olson's Listening Point from his first night sleeping there under the stars to the eventual building of a cabin. "From this one place I would explore the entire north and all life, including my own", he writes. "For me it would be a listening-post from which I might even hear the music of the spheres".</p><p>Through deeply personal stories, Olson brings life in the woods alive. He traces the history of a fallen leaf, explains the power of a canoe paddle cutting through the water, and the magic of listening to the rain pour on his tent flaps.</p><p>"Listening Point is dedicated to recapturing this almost forgotten sense of wonder and learning from rocks and trees and all the life that is found there, truths that can encompass all", he writes. "Through a vein of rose quartz at its tip can be read the geological history of the planet, from an old pine stump the ecological succession of the plant kingdom, from an Indian legend the story of the dreams of all mankind".</p><p>Considered by some to contain Olson's most vivid and moving passages, Listening Point is the nature lover's companion for hearing the depth and beauty of the great outdoors.</p><p>"With a poet's lyric voice, a guide's authorityand a warrior's commitment to his beloved canoe country wilderness, Sig Olson became the 'Voice of the North' to a generation of readers. He stands comfortably among the pantheon of great American nature writers -- Thoreau and Muir, Burroughs and Krutch, Leopold, Eiseley and Teale; but like one of his great sentinel pines, he also stands alone". Douglas Wood, author of Old Turtle</p></p><p>Listening Point is about the spiritual human connection to the environment. &#34;Each time I have gone there I have found something new which has opened up great realms of thought and interest&#34;, Sigurd F. Olson writes. &#34;For me it has been a point of discovery and, like all such places of departure, has assumed meaning far beyond the ordinary&#34;. Considered by some to contain Olson&#39;s most vivid and moving passages, Listening Point is the nature lover&#39;s companion for hearing the depth and beauty of the great outdoors.Olson was one of the greatest environmentalists of the twentieth century. A conservation activist and popular writer, Olson introduced a generation of Americans to the importance of wilderness.</p><h2>Yoga for Healthy Aging: A Guide to Lifelong Well-Being</h2><p><b>The definitive resource on how to use yoga to foster your physical, mental, and emotional health for a lifetime.</b><br><br>Everyone would like to age with as much strength and grace as possible and now numerous studies confirm what many yoga practitioners have known for a long time: yoga practice has a remarkable impact on physical and mental health&#x2014;and spiritual well-being&#x2014;as you grow older. <i>Yoga for Healthy Aging</i> is the definitive resource on how to use yoga to foster your physical, mental, and emotional health for a lifetime.<br><br> Baxter Bell, MD, and Nina Zolotow, respected yoga teachers and authors of the popular &#x201c;Yoga for Healthy Aging&#x201d; blog, explain how yoga can address concerns related to strength, flexibility, balance, agility, cardiovascular health, brain health, and stress management, among other issues.

It seeks to answer the questions: "Who are we?" and "Why are we here, on this planet?" It is offered to those who are looking for something beyond the superficial values of our culture, who may be disillusioned with religious and secular belief systems as currently presented and who question political values which are deeply mired in the pursuit of power. It is written with two voices: one the voice of a personal quest and the other which explores the historical and psychological causes that have brought into being our present view of reality.</p></p><p><p>Anne Baring has devoted her life to humanity's recovery of the anima mundi - the soul of the world, and indeed its own soul. The Dream of the Cosmos is the climax of that quest, the fruit of a lifetime of thought and feeling, learning and vision. It is the story of a dramatic personal journey, but also an attempt to confront the greatest issues facing our time. Every page breathes her moral passion, her love of beauty, her spiritual aspiration, her deep care for the Earth. Above all, Anne Baring calls for a fundamental transformation in the way human beings live on this Earth and with each other. It would not be too much to say that this book is a cri de coeur from a place deep in the collective psyche that carries not only our past but our future. The Dream of the Cosmos pulses with the fierce tenderness and grave urgency of love for an infinitely precious new being struggling to be born.<br> Richard Tarnas, <br> author of The Passion of the Western Mind and Cosmos and Psyche<br> <br> As Anne Baring writes in her opening, this book is a vocation. It is the opus magnum for which one might say, without exaggeration, that Anne has incarnated in this lifetime to produce for the benefit of many. The Dream of the Cosmos is at once both a visionary autobiography including many of Anne's own dreams, and a comprehensive archetypal history of the constellation, separation from, and resurgence of the feminine. Included in this deep scholarship are profound insights into the origins of misogyny as well as the soulful claims of instinct and its dangerous shadows expressed in violence and oppression. Anne leads us on a remarkable journey to understand the roots of our current suffering and the way forward to embrace a new and necessary sacred vision of reality -- one supported by the new sciences -- that<br> includes the whole of nature and the cosmos. If you read only one book in the next decade, this encyclopaedic volume is the one you should read.<br> Veronica Goodchild, <br> author of Songlines of the Soul: Pathways to A New Vision for a New Century<br> <br> Anne Baring is one of the great pioneers on the Divine Feminine of our time. Her work is a marvellous marriage of profound learning, deep and mature mystical experience and a vivid immediate gift of communication. Her latest book, The Dream of the Cosmos, is the consummation of her life's work, twenty years in the making. It is a masterpiece that will last a long time and deserves to be read by all seekers and anyone interested in the birth of a new civilization out of the chaos of our time.<br> Andrew Harvey, <br> author of Return of the Mother and Radical Passion</p><p>Anne Baring's magnum opus, twenty years in the making, is one of the publishing<br> events of the year: brilliant, profound and magisterial in its scope. In it she addresses<br> the real cultural roots of our multifaceted crisis -- spiritual, psychological, ecological, <br> social, political and economic. The book is a symbol of hope and renaissance - essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the patterns of Western cultural history and the potentials of its future development.<br> David Lorimer, <br> The Scientific and Medical Network</p><p> </p><p> </p></p><h2>Beloved Unbeliever: Loving Your Husband into the Faith</h2><p>Discover positive ways to approach the problem of being unequally yoked.

I was born there, a place where the sun glinting on the navy-colored, foamy bay made you feel alive, and the crisp air gusting in from the North Sea ensured you never forgot your strong-blooded, Nordic roots. I lived a typical, healthy life with my family&#x2014;skiing, sledding, skating&#x2014;until everyone: my mother, my father, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, the neighbors, my classmates, my teachers . . . quit trusting me. I quit trusting me.<br> <br>It had been exactly five years and two months since the last time I had gone through a phase of my dreaded sleepwalking habit, when I was twenty-five. I have had what professionals call a REM behavior disorder&#x2014;a condition that takes sleepwalking to absurd levels&#x2014;since I was a child. Unlike most people who frame each day with an awakening from sleep and a submission back into it, I learned that the bracket on the slumbering end of my frame was seriously flawed. After a busy or stressful day when most people relish the thought of snuggling into their beds, wrapped in warm covers, their heads sinking into soft �pillows and sliding blissfully into a world of dreams where time ceases to exist, I fear going to sleep&#x2014;sometimes dread it.<br> <br>But I had begun to think I might be over my syndrome&#x2014;that I&#x2019;d succeeded in prying myself away from my younger self, that �treacherous girl, like I was a toy comprised of two plastic parts held together only by stubborn glue. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and my dis�order began rearing its ugly head again one warm summer morning in August. Later, my doctor would say it was the heat and the particle�filled air that acted as a trigger, but I came to see its resurfacing as much more fated&#x2014;a deeper prompt forcing me to dredge up raw, unwelcome memories.<br> <br>I woke up at my usual six a.m. alarm and noticed the light covers&#x2014;a sheet and thin blanket&#x2014;tangled and pushed to the bottom of the bed. I gave myself the benefit of the doubt. After all, it had been a hot night. All summer the temperature had hovered upward of ninety-five degrees and half the Northwest was on fire. Montana was no exception. Fires burned to the east, west, north, and south of the Flathead Valley, and the ones raging in and around Glacier National Park had started more than four weeks earlier. Now the thick smoke blanketed the mountains and choked the valley, making each day feel like an apocalyptic event lurked around the corner.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d closed the windows the night before because it seemed better to suffer the heat than to inhale the dense, toxic air. A fly had furiously buzzed along the windowsill, captive in the stagnant room. For a good half hour, I listened to its maddening buzz and its random, annoying flights. After I tried to swat at it when it flew too close to my face a number of times, it settled somewhere on the ash-covered sill and left me alone. I finally drifted off listening to the whir of the ceiling fan. Of course, I thought, such circumstances would give anyone a restless night. I&#x2019;d probably just kicked the covers down to get some air.<br> <br>I swung my feet to the wood-planked floor, pleased to feel the smooth slats under my soles, and sat for a second rubbing my arms. The morning light filtered through the smoky sky and stretched across the golden floor like gauze, turning it a sickly yellowish orange. I looked out the window, hopelessly wanting to see something wet&#x2014;some freshly soaked pavement, leaves dripping with moisture, or soil darkened by rain. It was bone-dry, the grass in the small yard turned beige, the leaves on the tips of the bushes tinged yellow. The pine trees in the side woods appeared diseased with reddish-brown needles, many already fallen and desiccated on the forest floor as if it were fall. There was no relief in the forecast.<br> <br>I picked up my phone from the bedside table and checked for messages. There were none, so I headed to the bathroom to shower and get ready to go into the lab. Nothing too pressing was going on, but I needed to finish some paperwork on a deceased man&#x2014;a young firefighter, in fact&#x2014;from the day before. He&#x2019;d been found separated from his crew, sitting still against a tree as if he were simply enjoying a peaceful moment in the forest, watching swallows diving in and out of branches or listening to the chickadees sing their songs, before continuing on his way. Only, in these fire-infested woods, there would be no birdsong. The ME determined that it was his heart&#x2014;an �arrhythmia&#x2014;but we&#x2019;d been called in before the ME made that determination just in case there was foul play.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d almost forgotten about my bedcovers when I looked in the mirror one last time, checking that my shoulder-length blond hair was secured neatly away from my face and that the small amount of blush I&#x2019;d applied wasn&#x2019;t on too thick. Not out of vanity, I just hated too much makeup. My fair skin didn&#x2019;t take it well, so I picked up a tissue and gently wiped my cheekbones to dab up any excess color and lighten the effect of the already faint pink powder.<br> <br>There were certain things you picked up from your mother whether you wanted to or not, and I could still hear her words: �Amerikanske jenter bruker for mye sminke. American girls wear too much makeup. After moving to Seattle from Norway at age eighteen, I went for months painting on as much cover-up and thick mascara as possible just to separate myself from the au naturel Nordic girl that my family knew. Just to ensure that when I looked in the mirror, I could almost pretend I was Americansk and not notice the ghostly, nearly translucent skin and the treacherous blue eyes staring back, constantly questioning who I was and why the hell I was alive.<br> <br>Eventually, I couldn&#x2019;t fight reality anymore and gave up one day after looking at myself and realizing I loathed the disguise just as much as I hated the girl underneath the raccoon liner, deep rosy blush, and mauve lipstick. That was the last time I wore heavy makeup.<br> <br>I threw the tissue in the trash and headed to the kitchen to make some coffee. When I stepped into the living room, I stopped immediately. The shelves on the other side of the room stood vacant except for two cast-iron book weights formed in the shape of easy chairs. My books weren&#x2019;t there. All of them, probably fifty&#x2014;paperbacks, hardbacks, and all my forensic texts&#x2014;had been taken down. Instead, four rows of stacked books, each slightly crooked, rose in columns before the fireplace. I glanced at my small dining room off to my right. Two dining chairs stood peculiarly on top of the oak table.<br> <br>What else had I done? I, of course, considered whether I had left the house or not, perhaps walked down the street in my underwear in the middle of the night&#x2014;maybe even peed on some of the neighbor&#x2019;s bushes. But, even though I work in forensics, it doesn&#x2019;t take a super sleuth to check out the scene. I had taken a look around, filled in a few blanks, and discerned I&#x2019;d done nothing crazy.<br> <br>All my doors were locked, my key still hidden in its jar above the refrigerator, unmoved since I&#x2019;d set it there before going to bed. My doors require keys for both entering and leaving. Since I&#x2019;m not particularly tall, no more than five-four, I would have had to have grabbed either a chair or my footstool to reach above the refrigerator. All signs indicated that I&#x2019;d only set the two chairs on the dining table and not messed with the other two. This I could also tell by a slight film of dust that had collected on the floor, since I hadn&#x2019;t eaten at my dining room table in months. And my footstool with its worn red, blue, and gold embroidered flowers and wooden lion&#x2019;s feet was exactly where I&#x2019;d left it: near my closet in the bedroom with a pile of dirty clothes draped across it.<br> <br>When I purchased the house, the locksmith thought I was crazy for wanting key locks that worked both ways, but as I mentioned, I don&#x2019;t trust myself. Not since I was exactly fifteen years and three months old. My parents used to try to convince me that there were plenty of people in the same boat&#x2014;those who felt like they couldn&#x2019;t maintain control at certain times: alcoholics, drug addicts, people with anger-�management issues. But my issue was different because I had always been fine during my waking moments. It was the nighttime that posed problems. Besides, I could see in their worried expressions, their furrowed brows and tear-filled eyes, that they didn&#x2019;t entirely believe the logic themselves, especially my mom. She wanted to, but ultimately, she couldn&#x2019;t. No one predicted that something as innocent as sleep could be lethal for me, for my family.<br> <br>I pushed down the sickening feeling that rose inside of me. I marched over, grabbed each chair, and scooted it back under the table where it belonged. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; I mumbled out loud to no one. Herbal tea, I thought, something without caffeine. I need herbal tea before I put away those damn books.</p><h2>The Assistant: A Novel</h2><p><p><i>The Assistant</i>, Bernard Malamud's second novel, originally published in 1957, is the story of Morris Bober, a grocer in postwar Brooklyn, who "wants better" for himself and his family. First two robbers appear and hold him up; then things take a turn for the better when broken-nosed Frank Alpine becomes his assistant. But there are complications: Frank, whose reaction to Jews is ambivalent, falls in love with Helen Bober; at the same time he begins to steal from the store.</p><p>Like Malamud's best stories, this novel unerringly evokes an immigrant world of cramped circumstances and great expectations. Malamud defined the immigrant experience in a way that has proven vital for several generations of writers.</p><p>"His best novel . . . <i>The Assistant</i> is as tightly written as a prose poem." --Morris Dickstein in <i>Leopards in the Temple: The Transformation of American Fiction 1945-1970</i></p></p><p>&#34;The Assistant&#34;, by Pulitzer Prize-recipient Bernard Malamud, is considered an American literary classic. A real find for lovers of literature, praised by the Jewish Theological Seminary and Jewish Book World.Bernard Malamud was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. on April 26, 1914, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia. By his death in 1986, he had won the Pulitzer Prize and twice won the National Book Award and his books (such as "The Fixer", "The Natural") and stories (such as "The Angel Levine," "The Jewbird") had become American classics. "The Assistant," published in 1957, represents this great writer's belief in the noble drama of everyday lives and the universality of the Jewish experience. <p>George Guidall, winner of the 1999 "AUDIE", the audio publishing industry's highest honor, has recorded more than 500 books on tape.

So wherever he goes, he inevitably gets asked this question. This book is his answer. Writing with his daughter, Mpho, an Anglican priest, they lay out the simple but profound truths about the significance of forgiveness, how it works, why everyone needs to know how to grant it and receive it, and why granting forgiveness is the greatest gift we can give to ourselves when we have been wronged.</p><p>They explain the four-step process of forgiveness&#x2014;Telling the Story, Naming the Hurt, Granting Forgiveness, and Renewing or Releasing the Relationship&#x2014;as well as offer meditations, exercises, and prayers to guide the reader along the way.</p><p>"With each act of forgiveness, whether small or great, we move toward wholeness," they write. "Forgiveness is how we bring peace to ourselves and our world."</p><p><b>Desmond Mpilo Tutu</b> was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In 1986 he was elected archbishop of Cape Town, the highest position in the Anglican Church in South Africa. In 1994, after the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela, Tutu was appointed as chair of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate apartheid-era crimes. His policy of forgiveness and reconciliation has become an international example of conflict resolution and a trusted method of postconflict reconstruction. He is currently the chair of the Elders, where he gives vocal defense of human rights and campaigns for the oppressed.</p></p><h2>So Great Salvation: What It Means to Believe in Jesus Christ</h2><p><p><b>What is salvation? How does God work this miracle in our lives?<br></b><br>One of the greatest themes that challenges the heart and mind of man is salvation. It is not a trivial subject; it is a matter of life and death. Many pastors and authors have attempted to expound upon it. Yet how difficult it is to comprehend God's grace that forgives all our sins every day and night, without preconditions, without works.<br><br>Scholar and theologian Charles Ryrie writes on the subject of salvation with humility and compassion. He brings clarity where there is confusion. While he quotes carefully and accurately from a wide range of authors, his final authority is the Word of God.<br><br>The gospel is the good news of the grace of God to give forgiveness and eternal life. <i>So Great Salvation </i>shows us that we can be confident of our salvation, certain we are forgiven by God, and sure we are destined for heaven. </p></p><p><b>CHARLES C. RYRIE</b> (A.B., Haverford College; Th.M. and Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary; Ph.D., University of Edinburgh; Litt.D., Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary) was a renowned author and scholar.

Bittman&#x2019;s recipe sketches are the ideal mix of inspiration and instruction: everything a home cook needs to prepare a delicious, healthful, and cost-conscious repertoire of meals for any season and any time of day. And since they&#x2019;re written with an eye for speed and flexibility, you can be cooking on a moment&#x2019;s notice&#x2014;just check the pantry or fridge and away you go. With Bittman&#x2019;s trusted voice leading you, you&#x2019;ll be in and out of your kitchen in 20 minutes or less. Bittman also includes a guide to the foods you&#x2019;ll want on hand to cook the Kitchen Express way as well as suggestions for seasonal menus and lists of recipes for specific uses, like brown-bag lunches or the best dishes for reheating. You may never order takeout again!</p><p>Mark Bittman is the author of&nbsp;<i>Food Matters,</i>&nbsp;<i>How to Cook Everything</i> and other cookbooks, and of the weekly <i>New York Times</i> column, <i>The Minimalist</i>. His work has appeared in countless newspapers and magazines, and he is a regular on the <i>Today</i> show. Mr. Bittman has hosted two public television series and has appeared in a third.<b></b><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>The simple format of <i>Kitchen Express</i> belies all that it has to offer. Here are 101 incredibly fast and easy recipes for each season -- 404 in all. The experienced home cook can play with each to great advantage, yet at their core, they're recipes presented in the simplest form possible, understandable and readily executed by anyone who's done some cooking.</p><p>As a group, they are precisely imprecise. This is unusual for recipes, but it's long been my belief that the most specific recipes are the most limiting. Specificity is fine for baking, where the chemistry among the ingredients often determines success or failure. But in savory cooking, where amounts can vary wildly -- there's almost never a critical difference between one onion and two: A "head" of broccoli might weigh one or one-and-a-half pounds; a steak may be three-quarters to an inch and a half thick -- to try to force cooks to follow recipes demanding precision robs them of the ability to improvise, to relax, to substitute, to use their own judgment.</p><p>Jacques Pepin once remarked to me that the old adage about never stepping foot in the same river twice holds true for recipes also: You don't start with the same amount of ingredients, they're not at the same temperature, they're not the same age or from the same place, the ambient temperature and humidity are probably different, as are your equipment and mood. Everything is different, and the results will be too.</p><p>These little recipes acknowledge that up front. I don't really care how much garlic you use in most recipes, so "some" is as good as "a teaspoon." Similarly, garnishes are garnishes: You use more, you use less, you leave them out -- it shouldn't matter. "A carrot" in a soup could certainly be a big one or a small one, and so on. So I rarely give exact measurements, unless proportions are critical.</p><p>This style of cooking is about three things: speed, flexibility, and relaxation. If you read one of these recipes, if it inspires you, and if you have the ingredients (or something approximating them) to throw it together -- then go into the kitchen, assemble what you need, and have at it. Twenty minutes later, max, you'll be eating something delicious. What's wrong with that?Copyright � 2009 by Mark Bittman</p></p><h2>The Ghost Road (Regeneration Trilogy)</h2><p><b>Set in the closing months of World War I, this towering novel combines poetic intenstiy with gritty realism as it brings Pat Barker&#x2019;s Regeneration trilogy to its stunning conclusion.</b><br><br>In France, millions of men engaged in brutal trench warfare are all &#x201c;ghosts in the making.&#x201d; In England, psychologist William Rivers, with severe pangs of conscience, treats the mental casualties of the war to make them whole enough to fight again. One of these, Billy Prior, risen to the officer class from the working class, both courageous and sardonic, decides to return to France with his fellow officer, poet Wilfred Owen, to fight a war he no longer believes in. Meanwhile, Rivers, enfevered by influenza&nbsp;returns in memory to his experience studying&nbsp;a South Pacific tribe whose ethos amounted to a culture of death. Across the gulf between his society and theirs, Rivers begins to form connections that cast new light on his&#x2014;and our&#x2014;understanding of war.<br><br><b>Winner of the 1995 Booker Prize</b></p><p><b>Pat Barker&nbsp;</b>has earned a place in the first rank of contemporary British writers with such novels as&nbsp;<i>Union Street</i>,&nbsp;<i>Regeneration</i>&nbsp;(shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize and chosen by the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;as one of the four best novels of 1992),&nbsp;<i>The Eye in the Door </i>(winner of the 1993 Guardian fiction prize), <i>The Ghost Road</i>&nbsp;(winner of the 1995 Booker Prize), and <i>Noonday</i>. Barker lives in Durham, England.When Billy Prior returns to France for the fourth time in September of 1918, it&#39;s like coming home. He does so against everyone&#39;s advice, but when he watches the sun rise slowly after the Battle of Joncourt, he realizes why he couldn&#39;t have stayed back. And mysteriously, so do we. Peter Firth&#39;s reading captures perfectly Barker&#39;s tragic mix of pity and apotheosis. An accomplished British actor, Firth is at once the cynical, but savvy, Prior, the stammering Professor Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), soft-spoken Dr. Rivers, all with transparent ease. His unerring sense of character and tone recreates the bitter irony of that last push in 1918 when so many died so needlessly. For Barker, these last dead, though they sour the trumpet of victory, are war&#39;s only winners. At the end Firth&#39;s silence becomes eloquent. P.E.F. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner.

It is a profound excursion into religious psychology and phenomenology, a pioneering attempt at a philosophy of halakhah, and a stringent critique of mysticism and romantic religion.</p><p>"The best single introduction to Jewish religious thought in print."&#x2014;<i>Theology Today</i> (<i>Theology Today</i>)</p><h2>Five Smooth Stones: A Novel (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p><p>This gripping bestseller, first published in 1966, has continued to captivate readers with its wide-ranging yet intimate portrait of an America sundered by racial conflict. David Champlin is a black man born into poverty in Depression-era New Orleans who makes his way up the ladder of success, only to sacrifice everything to lead his people in the civil rights movement. Sara Kent is the white girl who loves David from the moment she first sees him, and who struggles against his belief that a marriage for them would be wrong in the violent world he has to confront.

Many find the subject to be boring or confusing, and with good reason. Most of the standard books on research methods fail to highlight the most important concepts and questions. Instead, they brim with dry technical definitions and focus heavily on statistical analysis, slighting other valuable methods. This approach not only dulls potential enjoyment of the course, but prevents students from mastering the skills they need to engage more directly and meaningfully with a wide variety of research.<br> <br> With wit and practical wisdom<i>,</i> Christopher Howard draws on more than a decade of experience teaching research methods to transform a typically dreary subject and teach budding political scientists the critical skills they need to read published research more effectively and produce better research of their own. The first part of the book is devoted to asking three fundamental questions in political science: What happened? Why? Who cares? In the second section, Howard demonstrates how to answer these questions by choosing an appropriate research design, selecting cases, and working with numbers and written documents as evidence. Drawing on examples from American and comparative politics, international relations, and public policy, <i>Thinking Like a Political Scientist</i> highlights the most common challenges that political scientists routinely face, and each chapter concludes with exercises so that students can practice dealing with those challenges.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Howard</b> is the Pamela C.

It will serve students well for years to come.&#x201d; (Sanford F. Schram, Hunter College, CUNY)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Thinking Like a Political Scientist</i> is a remarkably clear and well-written book. Drawing on more than a decade of experience teaching research methods, Howard moves seamlessly from one lesson to the next, developing the basic components of political science research in a compelling and intuitive way. Among the book&#x2019;s many virtues are its extraordinarily rich and wide-ranging examples that enliven the lessons.&#x201d; (Daniel Galvin, Northwestern University)<br><br>&#x201c;Howard has filled an important void in the discipline with this valuable alternative to the traditional approach to teaching undergraduate research methods. <i>Thinking Like a Political Scientist</i> is engaging and relevant, as it takes students through what political scientists actually do&#x2014;develop and test theories that explain political phenomena.

After a chapter of background on the period from 1921 to 1963, it covers the ensuing period&#x2015;the descent into violence, the hunger strikes, the Anglo-Irish accord, the bombers in England&#x2015;to the present shaky peace process. Behind the deluge of information and opinion about the conflict, there is a straightforward and gripping story. Mr. McKittrick and Mr. McVea tell that story clearly, concisely, and, above all, fairly, avoiding intricate detail in favor of narrative pace and accessible prose. They describe and explain a lethal but fascinating time in Northern Ireland's history, which brought not only death, injury, and destruction but enormous political and social change. They close on an optimistic note, convinced that while peace&#x2015;if it comes&#x2015;will always be imperfect, a corner has now been decisively turned. The book includes a detailed chronology, statistical tables, and a glossary of terms.</p><p>David McKittrick writes for the <i>Independent</i> and is a winner of the Orwell Prize for Journalism.

Tristram ShandyIntroduction and Notes by Robert Folkenflik <p>Rich in playful double entendres, digressions, formal oddities, and typographical experiments, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman provoked a literary sensation when it first appeared in England in a series of volumes from 1759 to 1767. An ingeniously structured novel (about writing a novel) that fascinates like a verbal game of chess, "Tristram Shandy is the most protean and playful English novel of the eighteenth century and a celebration of the art of fiction; its inventiveness anticipates the work of Joyce, Rushdie, and Fuentes in our own century. This Modern Library Paperback is set from the nine-volume first edition from 1759.</p></p><h2>A Thread Across the Ocean: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable</h2><p><p>Today, in a world in which news flashes around the globe in an instant, time lags are inconceivable. In the mid-nineteenth century, communication between the United States and Europe -- the center of world affairs -- was only as quick as the fastest ship could cross the Atlantic, making the United States isolated and vulnerable.</p><p>But in 1866, the Old and New Worlds were united by the successful laying of a cable across the Atlantic. John Steele Gordon's book chronicles this extraordinary achievement -- the brainchild of American businessman Cyrus Field and one of the greatest engineering feats of the nineteenth century. An epic struggle, it required a decade of effort, numerous failed attempts, millions of dollars in capital, a near disaster at sea, the overcoming of seemingly insurmountable technological problems, and uncommon physical, financial, and intellectual courage. Bringing to life an overlooked story in the annals of technology, John Steele Gordon sheds fascinating new light on this American saga that literally changed the world.</p></p><p><p>John Steele Gordon is a columnist for <em>American Heritage</em> and the author of <em>A Thread Across the Ocean</em>, <em>The Great Game</em>, <em>Hamilton's Blessing</em>, and <em>The Scarlet Woman of Wall Street</em>. His writing has appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. He lives in North Salem, New York.</p>Adult/High School-In this engaging history of the laying of the cable, Gordon conveys a keen sense of the mid-19th-century setting and the high drama of the venture. Superb documentation enhances the telling without distracting from the main story, and the text is accompanied by effective pen-and-ink illustrations. Begun in 1855, and necessitating a sustained level of cooperation among business, scientific, and political players in the face of disasters at sea, loss of capital, and, eventually, the stresses of the American Civil War, the enterprise's success is largely credited to American businessman Cyrus Field. His unflagging zeal, financial resourcefulness, and reputation for integrity as he worked in concert with entrepreneurs, inventors, engineers, lawyers, and statesmen on both sides of the Atlantic skillfully guided the project through four failed attempts before its completion in 1866. The project's technological challenges were equaled only by the optimism of the age and by the dedication of visionaries who foresaw the possibilities of what now seems commonplace, i.e., "real time" communication between the continents. This saga fills a niche by offering both economic history and a depiction of scientific inquiry during the Industrial Revolution.<br><i>Lynn Nutwell, Fairfax City Regional Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Women Counseling Women: Biblical Answers to Life&#39;s Difficult Problems</h2><p><p>Multitudes of women struggle daily with negative habits and addictions, emotions such as anger and depression, various kinds of loneliness, and other difficulties experienced by mothers, wives, or singles.</p><p>Here is a rich counseling resource that looks to the Bible alone as being sufficient to address our every need.

She used to work for the U.S. government, but very few people ever knew that. An expert in her field, she was one of the darkest secrets of an agency so clandestine it doesn&#x2019;t even have a name. And when they decided she was a liability, they came for her without warning. Now, she rarely stays in the same place or uses the same name for long. They&#x2019;ve killed the only other person she trusted, but something she knows still poses a threat. They want her dead, and soon. When her former handler offers her a way out, she realizes it&#x2019;s her only chance to erase the giant target on her back. But it means taking one last job for her ex-employers. To her horror, the information she acquires only makes her situation more dangerous. Resolving to meet the threat head on, she prepares for the toughest fight of her life, but finds herself falling for a man who can only complicate her likelihood of survival.

By the 1930s, however, the Soviet workers' democracy had crumbled into a state of bureaucratic decay that ultimately gave rise to an infamous totalitarian regime. Trotsky employs facts, figures, and statistics to show how Stalinist policies rejected the enormous productive potential of the nationalized planned economy in favor of a wasteful and corrupt bureaucratic system.<br>Six decades after the publication of this classic, the shattering of Stalinist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe has confused and demoralized countless political activists. <i>The Revolution Betrayed</i> offers readers of every political persuasion an insider's view of what went wrong.</p><p>Leon Trotsky (7 November [O.S. 26 October] 1879 &#x2013; 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army. Trotsky initially supported the Menshevik Internationalists faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He joined the Bolsheviks just before the 1917 October Revolution, and eventually became a leader within the Communist Party. He was, alongside Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov, one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution. During the early days of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army, with the title of People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs. He was a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War (1918&#x2013;1923). After leading a failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and against the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was removed from power (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma&#x2013;Ata (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union from exile. On Stalin's orders, he was assassinated in Mexico in August 1940 by Ram�n Mercader, a Spanish-born Soviet agent. Trotsky's ideas formed the basis of Trotskyism, a major school of Marxist thought that opposes the theories of Stalinism. He was written out of the history books under Stalin, and was one of the few Soviet political figures who were not rehabilitated by the government under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s. It was not until the late 1980s that his books were released for publication in the Soviet Union, which dissolved a short time later.</p><h2>From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia</h2><p><p>A <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>The Economist</i> Best Book of the Year and a <i>New York Times</i> Book Review Editors' Choice</p><p>A SURPRISING, GRIPPING NARRATIVE DEPICTING THE THINKERS WHOSE IDEAS SHAPED CONTEMPORARY CHINA, INDIA, AND THE MUSLIM WORLD</p><p>A little more than a century ago, independent thinkers across Asia sought to frame a distinct intellectual tradition that would inspire the continent's rise to dominance.

A popular general after his victories in northern Italy, he had been lobbying his civilian superiors for an invasion of Britain. But the Royal Navy was still too strong, and the French were not ready to confront it. In the meantime, France needed colonies in order to prosper, as its foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand believed, and a presence in Egypt would not only compensate the French for their loss of territory in North America, it could also pose a serious challenge to the British East India Company, which produced highly profitable cash crops in its Indian possessions. Expanding across India, the British had expelled the French from most of their early bases on the coast. In 1798, the British were locked into a fierce battle with one of their most wily Indian opponents, Tipu Sultan, an ally of France. French control of Egypt could tip the balance of power against the British in India while also deterring the Russians, who eyed the Ottoman Empire. 'As soon as I have made England tremble for the safety of India,' Napoleon declared, 'I shall return to Paris and give the enemy its death blow.' Apart from his country's geopolitical aims, Napoleon cherished his own private fantasy of conquering the Orient. 'Great reputations', he was convinced, 'are only made in the Orient; Europe is too small.'1 From Egypt he planned to push eastwards in an Alexander-the-Great-style invasion of Asia, with him riding an elephant and holding a new, personally revised Koran that would be the harbinger of a new religion. Napoleon travelled to Egypt with a large contingent of scientists, philosophers, artists, musicians, astronomers, architects, surveyors, zoologists, printers and engineers, all meant to record the dawn of the French Enlightenment in the backward East. The momentousness of the occasion - the first major contact between modernizing Europe and Asia - was not lost on Napoleon. On board his ship in the Mediterranean, he exhorted his soldiers: 'You are about to undertake a conquest, the effects of which on civilization and commerce of the world areimmeasurable.'2 He also drafted grand proclamations addressed to the Egyptian people, describing the new French Republic based upon liberty and equality, even as he professed the highest admiration for the Prophet Muhammad and Islam in general. Indeed the French, he claimed, were also Muslims, by virtue of their rejection of the Christian Trinity. He also made some noises - familiar to us after two centuries of imperial wars disguised as humanitarian interventions - about delivering the Egyptians from their despotic masters. Appearing without warning in Alexandria in July 1798, the French overcame all military opposition as they proceeded towards Cairo. Egypt was then nominally part of the Ottoman Empire though it was ruled directly by a caste of former slave-soldiers called Mamluks. Its meagre armies were not equipped to fight war-hardened French soldiers who outnumbered the Egyptians and were also backed by the latest military technology. Reaching Cairo after some easy victories, Napoleon commandeered a mansion for himself on the banks of the then Azbakiya Lake, installed the scholars from his baggage train at a new Institut d'�gypte, and set about politically engineering Egypt along republican lines. He thought up a Divan consisting of wise men, an Egyptian version of the Directory that exercised executive power in Paris. But where were wise men to be found in Cairo, which had been abandoned by its ruling class, the Ottoman Mamluks? Much to their bewilderment, Cairo's leading theologians and religious jurists found themselves promoted to political positions and frequently summoned for consultation by Napoleon - marking the first of many such expedient attempts at politically empowering Islam by supposedly secular Westerners in Asia. Suppressing his allegiance to the Enlightenment, Napoleon vigorously appeased conservative Muslim clerics in the hope they might form the bulwark of pro-French forces in the country. He dressed up in Egyptian robes on the Prophet's birthday and, much to the disquiet of his own secular-minded soldiers, hinted at a mass French conversion to Islam. Some sycophantic (and probably, derisive) Egyptians hailed him as Ali Bonaparte, naming him after the revered son-in-law of the Prophet. This encouraged Napoleon to suggest to the clericsthat the Friday sermon at al-Azhar Mosque, one of Islam's holiest buildings, be said in his name. The devout Muslims were flabbergasted. The head of the Divan, Sheikh al-Sharqawi, recovered sufficiently to say, 'You want to have the protection of the Prophet ... You want the Arab Muslims to march beneath your banners. You want to restore the glory of Arabia ... Become a Muslim!'3 An evasive Napoleon replied: 'There are two difficulties preventing my army and me from becoming Muslims. The first is circumcision and the second is wine. My soldiers have the habit from their infancy, and I will never be able to persuade them to renounce it.'4 Napoleon's attempt to introduce Egyptian Muslims to the glories of French secularism and republicanism were equally doomed. Cairenes deplored his dramatic alterations to the cityscape, and the corrupting influence of the French in general. As one observer wrote, 'Cairo has become a second Paris, women go about shamelessly with the French; intoxicating drinks are publicly sold and things are committed of which the Lord of Heaven would not approve.'5 In the summer of 1798, Napoleon made it mandatory for all Egyptians to wear the tricolour cockade, the knotted ribbon preferred by French republicans. Inviting members of the Divan to his mansion, he tried to drape a tricolour shawl over the shoulders of Sheikh al-Sharqawi. The Sheikh's face turned red from fear of blasphemy and he flung it to the ground. An angry Napoleon insisted that the clerics would have to wear the cockade at least, if not the shawl. An unspoken compromise was finally arrived at: Napoleon would pin the cockade to the chests of the clerics, and they would take it off as soon as they left his company. The Islamic eminences may have been trying to humour their strange European conqueror while trying to live for another day. Many other Muslims saw plainly the subjugation of Egypt by a Christian from the West as a catastrophe; and they were vindicated when French soldiers, while suppressing the first of the Egyptian revolts against their occupation, stormed the al-Azhar mosque, tethered their horses to the prayer niches, trampled the Korans under their boots, drank wine until they were helpless and then urinated on the floor. Napoleon, though ready to burn hostile villages, execute prisoners and tear down mosques for the sake of wide roads, actually indulged in fewer atrocities in Egypt than he was to elsewhere; he was always keen to express his admiration for Islam. Still, the Egyptian cleric and scholar 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, who chronicled Napoleon's conquest of Egypt, described it as 'great battles, terrible events, disastrous facts, calamities, unhappiness, sufferings, persecutions, upsets in the order of things, terror, revolutions, disorders, devastations - in a word, the beginning of a series of great misfortunes'.6 And this was the reaction of a somewhat sympathetic witness. When the news of Napoleon's exploits arrived in the Hejaz, the people of Mecca tore down the drapery - traditionally made in Egypt - around the sacred Kaaba. &nbsp; <br> The dramatic gesture clearly expressed how many Muslims would see Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. It had disrupted nothing less than the long-established cosmic order of Islam - something that human history had shown to be more than a widely shared delusion. The word 'Islam', describing the range of Muslim beliefs and practices across the world, was not used before the nineteenth century. But few Muslims anywhere over the centuries would have doubted that they belonged to both a collective and an individual way of life, an intense solidarity based on certain shared values, beliefs and traditions. To be a good Muslim was to belong to a community of like-minded upholders of the moral and social order. It was also to participate in the making and expansion of the righteous society of believers and, by extension, in the history of Islam as it had unfolded since God first commanded the Prophet Muhammad to live according to His plan. This history began with astonishing successes, and for centuries it seemed that God's design for the world was being empirically fulfilled. In AD 622, the first year of the Islamic calendar, Muhammad and his band of followers established the first community of believers in a small town in Arabia. Less than a century later, Arab Muslims were in Spain. Great empires - Persian and Byzantine - fell before the energetically expanding community of Muslims. Islam quickly became the new symbol of authority from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas, and theorder it created wasn't just political or military. The conquerors of Jerusalem, North Africa and India brought into being a fresh civilization with its own linguistic, legal and administrative standards, its own arts and architecture and orders of beauty. The invading Mongols broke into this self-contained world in the thirteenth century, briskly terminating the classical age of Islam. But within fifty years the Mongols had themselves converted to Islam and become its most vigorous champions. Sufi orders spread across the Islamic world, sparking a renaissance of Islam in non-Arab lands. From Kufa to Kalimantan, the travelling scholar, the trader and the Friday assembly gave Islam an easy new portability. Indeed, Islam was as much a universalizing ideology as Western modernity is now, and it successfully shaped distinctive political systems, economies and cultural attitudes across a wide geographical region: the fourteenth-century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta had as little trouble getting jobs at imperial courts in India or in West Africa as a Harvard MBA would in Hong Kong and Cape Town today. The notion of a universal community of Muslims, the <i>umma,</i> living under the symbolic authority of a <i>khalifa</i> (caliph), in a <i>Dar al-Islam</i> (land of Muslims), which was distinct from the remote and peripheral <i>Dar al-Harb</i> (land of war), helped Muslims from Morocco to Java to imagine a central place in the world for themselves and their shared values. Itinerant Muslim traders from India were still displacing Hinduism and Buddhism in Indonesia and even Indochina as late as the seventeenth century. Extensive mercantile networks and pilgrimage routes to Mecca from all corners of the world affirmed the unity of <i>Dar al-Islam.</i> World trade in fact depended on Muslim merchants, seafarers and bankers. For a Muslim in North Africa, India or South-east Asia, history retained its moral and spiritual as well as temporal coherence; it could be seen as a gradual working out of God's plan. Though beset by internal problems in the eighteenth century, Muslim empires still regarded Europeans as only slightly less barbarous than their defeated Crusader ancestors. So the success of Napoleon suggested something inconceivable: that the Westerners, though still quite crude, were beginning to forge ahead. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Europe was to express, as the nineteenth century progressed, an idea of itself through its manifold achievements of technology, constitutional government, secular state and modern administration; and this idea, which emerged from the American and French revolutions and which seemed to place the West in the avant-garde of progress, would be increasingly hard to refute. Already in 1798, a remarkably high degree of organization defined the post-revolutionary French state as well as the French people, who were coming together on the basis of an apparently common language, territory and history to constitute a separate and distinct 'nation-state'. Faced with the evidence of Europe's advantages, many Muslims were initially bemused and unable to assess it correctly. 'The newly established republic in France', the Ottoman historian Asim recognized in 1801, 'is different from the other Frankish polities.' But then he went on to say: 'Its ultimate basis is an evil doctrine consisting of the abandonment of religion and the equality of rich and poor.' As for parliamentary deliberations, they were 'like the rumblings and crepitations of a queasy stomach'.7 Some of this cultural arrogance lingered in the eyewitness accounts of Napoleon's conquest by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti. The cleric generally found French practices distasteful, even barbaric: 'It is their custom', he wrote, 'not to bury their dead but to toss them on garbage heaps like the corpses of dogs and beasts, or to throw them into the sea.'8 'Their women do not veil themselves and have no modesty ... They [the French] have intercourse with any woman who pleases them and vice versa.'9 Al-Jabarti also mocked French hats, the European habit of peeing in public, and the use of toilet paper. He contemptuously dismissed Napoleon's claim to be a protector of Islam, laughing at the bad Arabic grammar of the Frenchman's proclamations, and he sniggered when the French failed to launch a hot-air balloon at one of their demonstrations of European scientific prowess. Al-Jabarti's limited experience of political institutions made him misunderstand French revolutionary ideals: 'their term "liberty" means,' he concluded too hastily, 'that they are not slaves like the Mamluks'.10 He sensed the hostility to his own Islamic values in Napoleon's claim that 'all the people are equal in the eyes of God'.'This is a lie, and ignorance, and stupidity,' he thundered. 'How can this be when God has made some superior to others?'11 Still, al-Jabarti, who had been educated at al-Azhar, couldn't fail to be impressed when he visited the Institut d'�gypte, where the intellectuals in Napoleon's entourage had a well-stocked library. Whoever wishes to look up something in a book asks for whatever volumes he wants and the librarian brings them to him ... All the while they are quiet and no one disturbs his neighbor ... among the things I saw there was a large book containing the Biography of the Prophet ... The glorious Qur'an is translated into their language! ... I saw some of them who know chapters of the Qur'an by heart. They have a great interest in the sciences, mainly in mathematics and the knowledge of languages, and make great efforts to learn the Arabic language and the colloquial. 12 Al-Jabarti was also struck by the efficiency and discipline of the French army, and he followed with great curiosity the electoral processes in the Divan that Napoleon had created, explaining to his Arab readers how members wrote their votes on strips of paper, and how majority opinion prevailed. Al-Jabarti was not entirely deaf to the lessons from Napoleon's conquest: that the government in the world's first modern nation-state did not merely collect taxes and tributes and maintain law and order; it could also raise a conscript army, equip ...</p><h2>Where Hope Prevails (Return to the Canadian West)</h2><p><b>Inspiring Conclusion to a Popular Series with a TV tie-in <br><br></b>When Beth Thatcher returns to Coal Valley, she has much to be excited about.

He wrote, almost daily, intimate and outspoken letters to his wife in which his private feelings and-after the tide had turned-forebodings found expression. To this is added by Rommel's son Manfred the story of the field marshall's last weeks and the final day when he was given the choice of an honorable suicide or an ignominious trial for treason.

Drawing from the original Pali Canon, the seminal collection of Buddhist discourses compiled after the Buddha&#x2019;s death by his followers, Batchelor shows us the Buddha as a flesh-and-blood man who looked at life in a radically new way. Batchelor also reveals the everyday challenges and doubts of his own devotional journey&#x2014;from meeting the Dalai Lama in India, to training as a Zen monk in Korea, to finding his path as a lay teacher of Buddhism living in France.

I remember the date because it marked the fourteenth anniversary of the Tibetan uprising in Lhasa in 1959, which triggered the flight of the Dalai Lama into the exile from which he has yet to return. I was studying Buddhism in Dharamsala,the Tibetan capital in exile, a former British hill-station in the Himalayas. The sky that morning was dark, damp, and foreboding. Earlier, the clouds had unleashed hailstones the size of miniature golf balls that now lay fused in white clusters along the roadsidethat led from the village of McLeod Ganj down to the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, where the anniversary was to be commemorated.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A white canvas awning, straining and flapping in the wind, was strung in front of the Library. Beneath it sat a huddle of senior monks in burgundy robes, aristocrats in long gray chubas, and the Indian superintendent of police from Kotwali Bazaar. I joineda crowd gathered on a large terrace below and waited for the proceedings to begin. The Dalai Lama, a spry, shaven-headed man of thirty-eight, strode onto an impromptu stage. The audience spontaneously prostrated itself as one onto the muddy ground. He reada speech, which was barely audible above the wind, delivered in rapid-fire Tibetan, a language I did not yet understand, at a velocity I would never master. Every now and then a drop of rain would descend from the lowering sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I was distracted from my thoughts about the plight of Tibet by the harsh shriek of what sounded like a trumpet. Perched on a ledge on the steep hillside beside the Library, next to a smoking fire, stood a bespectacled lama, legs akimbo, blowing into athighbone and ringing a bell. His disheveled hair was tied in a topknot. A white robe, trimmed in red, was slung carelessly across his left shoulder. When he wasn't blowing his horn, he would mutter what seemed like imprecations at the grumbling clouds, hisright hand extended in the threatening mudra, a ritual gesture used to ward off danger. From time to time he would put down his thighbone and fling an arc of mustard seeds against the ominous mists.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Then there was an almighty crash. Rain hammered down on the corrugated iron roofs of the residential buildings on the far side of the Library, obliterating the Dalai Lama's words. This noise went on for several minutes. The lama on the hillside stampedhis feet, blew his thighbone, and rang his bell with increased urgency. The heavy drops of rain that had started falling on the dignitaries and the crowd abruptly stopped. &nbsp; After the Dalai Lama left and the crowd dispersed, I joined a small group of fellow Injis. In reverential tones, we discussed how the lama on the hill--whose name was Yeshe Dorje--had prevented the storm from soaking us. I heard myself say: "And you couldhear the rain still falling all around us: over there by the Library and on those government buildings behind as well." The others nodded and smiled in awed agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Even as I was speaking, I knew I was not telling the truth. I had heard no rain on the roofs behind me. Not a drop. Yet to be convinced that the lama had prevented the rain with his ritual and spells, I had to believe that he had created a magical umbrellato shield the crowd from the storm. Otherwise, what had happened would not have been that remarkable. Who has not witnessed rain falling a short distance away from where one is standing on dry ground? Perhaps it was nothing more than a brief mountain showeron the nearby hillside. None of us would have dared to admit this possibility. That would have brought us perilously close to questioning the lama's prowess and, by implication, the whole elaborate belief system of Tibetan Buddhism.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>For several years, I continued to peddle this lie. It was my favorite (and only) example of my firsthand experience of the supernatural powers of Tibetan lamas. But, strangely, whenever I told it, it didn't feel like a lie. I had taken the lay Buddhistprecepts and would soon take monastic vows. I took the moral injunction against lying very seriously. In other circumstances, I would scrupulously, even neurotically, avoid telling the slightest falsehood. Yet, somehow, this one did not count. At times, I triedto persuade myself that perhaps it was true: the rain had fallen behind me, but I had not noticed. The others--albeit at my prompting--had confirmed what I said. But such logical gymnastics failed to convince me for very long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I suspect my lie did not feel like a lie because it served to affirm what I believed to be a greater truth. My words were a heartfelt and spontaneous utterance of our passionately shared convictions. In a weirdly unnerving way, I did not feel that "I"had said them. It was as though something far larger than all of us had caused them to issue from my lips. Moreover, the greater truth, in whose service my lie was employed, was imparted to us by men of unimpeachable moral and intellectual character. Thesekind, learned, enlightened monks would not deceive us. They repeatedly said to accept what they taught only after testing it as carefully as a goldsmith would assay a piece of gold. Since they themselves must have subjected these teachings to that kind of rigorousscrutiny during their years of study and meditation, then surely they were not speaking out of blind conviction, but from their own direct knowledge and experience? Ergo: Yeshe Dorje stopped the rain with his thighbone, bell, mustard seeds, and incantations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The next morning, someone asked the teacher at the Library, Geshe Dhargyey, to say something about the practices involved in controlling the weather. Geshe-la (as we called him) belonged to the scholarly Geluk school, in which the Dalai Lama had been trained.Not only did he possess an encyclopedic knowledge of Geluk orthodoxy, he radiated a joyous well-being that bubbled forth in mirthful chuckles. The question seemed to disturb him. He frowned, then said in a disapproving voice: "That was not good. No compassion.It hurts the devas." The devas in question belonged to a minor class of gods who manage the weather. To zap them with mantras, mudras, and mustard seeds were acts of violence. As an advocate of universal compassion, this was not something Geshe-la was preparedto condone. I was surprised by his willingness to criticize Yeshe Dorje, a lama from the Nyingma (Ancient) school of Tibetan Buddhism. And why, I wondered, would the Dalai Lama--the living embodiment of compassion--tolerate the performance of a ritual if itinjured devas?&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Tibetan lamas held a view of the world that was deeply at odds with the one in which I had been raised. Educated in the monasteries of old Tibet, they were ignorant of the findings of the natural sciences. They knew nothing of the modern disciplines ofcosmology, physics, or biology. Nor did they have any knowledge of the literary, philosophical, and religious traditions that flourished outside their homeland. For them, all that human beings needed to know had been worked out centuries before by the Buddhaand his followers and was preserved in the Kangyur and Tengyur (the Tibetan Buddhist canon). There you would learn that the earth was a triangular continent in a vast ocean dominated by the mighty Mount Sumeru, around which the sun, moon, and planets revolved.Driven by the force of good and bad deeds committed over beginningless former lifetimes, beings were repeatedly reborn as gods, titans, humans, animals, ghosts, and denizens of hell until they had the good fortune to encounter and put into practice the Buddha'steaching, which would enable them to escape the cycle of rebirth forever. Moreover, as followers of the Mahayana (Great Vehicle), Tibetan Buddhists vowed to keep taking birth out of compassion for all sentient beings until every last one of them was freed.Of the world's religions, they believed that Buddhism alone was capable of bringing suffering to an end. And of the various kinds of Buddhism, the most effective, rapid, and complete of them all was the form of the religion as preserved in Tibet.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; I believed all this. Or, more accurately: I wanted to believe all this. Never before had I encountered a truth I was willing to lie for. Yet, as I see it now, my lie did not spring from conviction but from a lack of conviction. It was prompted by my cravingto believe. Unlike some of my contemporaries, whom I envied, I would never achieve unwavering faith in the traditional Buddhist view of the world. Nor would I ever succeed in replacing my own judgments with uncritical surrender to the authority of a "root"lama, which was indispensable for the practice of the highest tantras, the only way, so it was claimed, to achieve complete enlightenment in this lifetime. No matter how hard I tried to ignore it or rationalize it away, my insincerity kept nagging at me ina dark, closed recess of my mind. By the lights of my Tibetan teachers, I was a Buddhist failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Chapter Two</i><br>ON THE ROAD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>FROM THE MONK'S cell, hewn out of the sandstone cliff centuries earlier, where I spent my days idly smoking a potent blend of marijuana, hashish, and tobacco, a narrow passage led to a dark inner staircase that I would illuminate by striking matches. Thesteep rock steps climbed to an opening that brought me out, via a narrow ledge, onto the smooth dome of the giant Buddha's head, which fell away dizzily on all sides to the ground one hundred and eighty feet below. On the ceiling of the niche above were fadedfragments of painted Buddhas and bodhisattvas. I feared looking up at them for too long lest I lose my balance, slip, and plummet earthward. As my eyes became used to the fierce sunlight, I would gaze out onto the fertile valley of Bamiyan, a patchwork of fieldsinterspersed with low, flat-roofed farmhouses, which lay stretched before me. It was the summer of 1972. This was my first encounter with the remains of a Buddhist civilization, one that had ended with Mahmud of Ghazni's conquest of Afghanistan in the eleventhcentury. &nbsp; Like others on the hippie trail to India, I thought of myself as a traveler rather than a mere tourist, someone on an indeterminate quest rather than a journey with a prescribed beginning and end. Had I been asked what I was seeking, I doubt my answerwould have been very coherent. I had no destination, either of the geographical or spiritual kind. I was simply "on the road," in that anarchic and ecstatic sense celebrated by Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and other role models I revered at the time.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; I enjoyed nothing more than simply being on the way to somewhere else. I was quite content to peer for hours through the grimy, grease-smeared windows of a rattling bus with cooped chickens in the aisle, observing farmers bent over as they toiled in fields,women carrying babies on their backs, barefoot children playing in the dust, old men seated in the shade smoking hookahs, and all the shabby little towns and villages at which we stopped for sweet tea and unleavened bread. Yet as soon as we entered the telltalesuburban sprawl of the city of our destination, my stomach would contract and I would feel anxious and restless again. I did not want to stop. My craving to keep moving was like an addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My first memory is that of sitting on my mother's lap, nestled in the folds of her fur coat while peering through an airplane window at the miniature houses and cars of Toronto. I was three years old. My parents had emigrated from Scotland to Canada in1957 in an attempt to save their marriage. They separated a year later and I returned to England with my mother and younger brother, David, where we grew up in Watford, a charmless suburb on the outer rim of London. My mother did not remarry and raised my brotherand me alone. I had no further contact with my father. &nbsp; We were initially supported by my mother's father, Alfred Craske, a businessman who had a photoengraving firm in Covent Garden. Alfred had rejected the God-fearing atmosphere of his childhood and considered all religion humbug, while his wife, Mabel--mygrandmother--was the demure daughter of the local Wesleyan minister. My mother adopted her father's views on religion and considered herself a humanist. Emotionally she remained close to her mother and her mother's sister Sophie, a nurse who had served in theDardanelles and Flanders, never married, and faithfully attended chapel. In the background hovered the enigmatic shadow of Alfred's younger brother Leonard, who had renounced a promising medical career and a young wife to pursue his passion for theater andsculpture in the United States. The Craskes had nothing further to do with him. A weathered bronze statue of a dancing nymph called "Joy" in our back garden was the only evidence of Leonard's existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As a child I did not attend church. I was exempted from "Scripture" classes at the schools I attended, so I did not receive the basic instruction in Christianity that was part of the British educational curriculum. When I was eight or nine, I rememberbeing struck by a BBC radio program that mentioned how Buddhist monks avoided walking on the grass in order not to kill any insects. I have often wondered whether this first positive impression of Buddhist monks played a role in my later adopting Buddhism,or whether I chose to remember it because in retrospect it helped me rationalize the unconventional decision I made to become a Buddhist monk myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>From an early age I was troubled by how rarely I experienced genuine contentment. I was conscious of how niggling worries were constantly present either in the center or at the periphery of my self-awareness. I remember lying awake at night trying to stopthe incessant outpouring of anxious thoughts. I was perplexed by the failure of teachers at school to address what seemed the most urgent matter of all: the bewildering, stomach-churning insecurity of being alive. The standard subjects of history, geography,mathematics, and English seemed perversely designed to ignore the questions that really mattered. As soon as I had some inkling of what "philosophy" meant, I was puzzled as to why we were not taught it. And my skepticism about religion only grew as I failedto see what the vicars and priests I encountered gained from their faith. They struck me either as insincere, pious, and aloof or just bumblingly good-natured.</p><h2>Meridon (The Wideacre Trilogy)</h2><p>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i> comes the final book of the extraordinary <i>Wideacre </i>trilogy as the heir to the great estate comes home at last.<br><br>Meridon knows she does not belong in the dirty, vagabond life of a gypsy bareback rider.

To ward off the smell and the dirt and the fights and the noise of the day. To keep me in that bright green place in my mind, which had no proper name; I called it "Wide."<br><br>"I don't belong here," I said again. A dirty-faced fifteen-year-old girl frowsy-eyed from sleep, blinking at the hard gray light filtering through the grimy window. I looked up to the arched ceiling of the caravan, the damp sacking near my face as I lay on the top bunk; and then I glanced quickly to my left to the other bunk to see if Dandy was awake.<br><br>Dandy: my black-eyed black-haired, equally dirty-faced sister. Dandy, the lazy one, the liar, the thief.<br><br>Her eyes, dark as blackberries, twinkled at me.<br><br>"I don't belong here," I whispered once more to the dream world of Wide, which faded even as I called to it. Then I said aloud to Dandy:<br><br>"Getting up?"<br><br>"Did you dream of it -- Sarah?" she asked softly, calling me by my magic secret name. The name I knew from my dreams of Wide. The magic name I use in that magic land.<br><br>"Yes," I said, and I turned my face away from her to the stained wall and tried not to mind that Wide was just a dream and a pretense. That the real world was here. Here where they knew nothing of Wide, had never even heard of such a place. Where, except for Dandy, they would not call me Sarah as I had once asked. They had laughed at me and gone on calling me by my real name, Meridon.<br><br>"What did you dream?" Dandy probed. She was not cruel, but she was too curious to spare me.<br><br>"I dreamed I had a father, a great big fair-headed man and he lifted me up. High, high up onto his horse. And I rode before him, down a lane away from our house and past some fields. Then up a path which went higher and higher, and through a wood and out to the very top of the fields, and he pointed his horse to look back down the way we had come, and I saw our house: a lovely square yellow house, small as a toy-house on the green below us."<br><br>"Go on," said Dandy.<br><br>"Shut up, you two," a muffled voice growled in the half-light of the caravan. "It's still night."<br><br>"It ain't," I said, instantly argumentative. My father's dark, tousled head peered around the head of his bunk and scowled at me. "I'll strap you," he warned me. "Go to sleep."<br><br>I said not another word. Dandy waited, and in a few moments she said in a whisper so soft that our Da -- his head buried beneath the dirty blankets -- could not hear: "What then?"<br><br>"We rode home," I said, screwing my eyes tight to relive the vision of the little redheaded girl and the fair man and the great horse and the cool green of the arching beech trees over the drive. "And then he let me ride alone."<br><br>Dandy nodded, but she was unimpressed. We had both been on and around horses since we were weaned. And I had no words to convey the delight of the great strides of the horse in the dream.<br><br>"He was telling me how to ride," I said. My voice went quieter still, and my throat tightened. "He loved me," I said miserably. "He did. I could tell by the way he spoke to me. He was my Da -- but he loved me."<br><br>"And then?" said Dandy, impatient.<br><br>"I woke up," I said. "That was all."<br><br>"Didn't you see the house, or your clothes, or the food?" she asked, disappointed.<br><br>"No," I said. "Not this time."<br><br>"Oh," she said and was silent a moment. "I wish I could dream of it like you do," she said longingly. "T'aint fair."<br><br>A warning grunt from the bed made us lower our voices again.<br><br>"I wish I could see it," she said.<br><br>"You will," I promised. "It is a real place. It is real somewhere. I know that somewhere it is a real place. And we will both be there, someday."<br><br>"Wide," she said. "It's a funny name."<br><br>"That's not the whole name," I said cautiously. "Not quite Wide. Maybe it's something-Wide. I never hear it clear enough. I listen and I listen but I'm never quite sure of it. But it's a real place. It is real somewhere. And it's where I belong."<br><br>I lay on my back and looked at the stains on the sacking roof of the caravan and smelled the stink of four people sleeping close with no windows open, the acid smell of stale urine from last night's pot.<br><br>"It's real somewhere," I said to myself. "It has to be."<br><br>There were three good things in my life, that dirty painful life of a gypsy child with a father who cared nothing for her, and a stepmother who cared less. There was Dandy, my twin sister -- as unlike me as if I were a changeling. There were the horses we trained and sold. And there was the dream of Wide.<br><br>If it had not been for Dandy I think I would have run away as soon as I was old enough to leave. I would have upped and gone, run off to one of the sleepy little villages in the New Forest in that hot summer of 1805 when I was fifteen. That was the summer I turned on Da and stood up to him for the first time ever.<br><br>We had been breaking a pony to sell as a lady's ride. I said the horse was not ready for a rider. Da swore she was. He was wrong. Anyone but an idiot could have seen that the horse was nervy and half-wild. But Da had put her on the lunge rein two or three times and she had gone well enough. He wanted to put me up on her. He didn't waste his breath asking Dandy to do it. She would have smiled one of her sweet slow smiles and disappeared off for the rest of the day with a hunk of bread and a rind of cheese in her pocket. She'd come back in the evening with a dead chicken tucked in her shawl, so there was never a beating for Dandy.<br><br>But he ordered me up on the animal. A half-wild, half-foolish foal too young to be broke, too frightened to be ridden.<br><br>"She's not ready," I said, looking at the flaring nostrils and the rolling whites of her eyes and smelling that special acrid smell of fearful sweat.<br><br>"She'll do," Da said. "Get up on her."<br><br>I looked at Da, not at the horse. His dark eyes were red-rimmed, the stubble on his chin stained his face blue. The red kerchief at his neck showed bright against his pallor. He had been drinking last night and I guessed he felt ill. He had no patience to stand in the midday sunshine with a skittish pony on a lunge rein.<br><br>"I'll lunge her," I offered. "I'll train her for you."<br><br>"You'll ride her, you cheeky dog," he said to me harshly. "No whelp tells me how to train a horse."<br><br>"What's the hurry?" I asked, backing out of arm's reach. Da had to hold the horse and could not grab me.<br><br>"I got a buyer," he said. "A farmer at Beaulieu wants her for his daughter. But he wants her next week for her birthday or summat. So she's got to be ready for then."<br><br>"I'll lunge her," I offered again. "I'll work her all day, and tomorrow or the day after I'll get up on her."<br><br>"You get up now," he said harshly. Then he raised his voice and yelled: "Zima!" and my stepmother came out into the sunshine from the gloomy caravan. "Hold 'er," he said nodding at the horse and she jumped down from the caravan step, and went past me without a word.<br><br>"I want summat inside the wagon," he said under his breath and I stood aside like a fool to let him go past me. But as soon as he was near he grabbed me with one hard grimy hand and twisted my arm behind my back so hard that I could hear the bone creak and I squeaked between clenched teeth for the pain.<br><br>"Get up on 'er," he said softly in my ear, his breath foul. "Or I'll beat you till you can't ride 'er, nor any other for a week."<br><br>I jerked away from him: sullen, ineffective. And I scowled at my stepmother, who stood picking her teeth with her free hand and watching this scene. She had never stood between me and him in my life. She had seen him beat me until I went down on my knees and cried and cried for him to stop. The most she had ever done for me was to tell him to stop because the noise of my sobbing was disturbing her own baby. I felt that I was utterly unloved, utterly uncared for; and that was no foolish girl's fear. That was the bitter truth.<br><br>"Get up," Da said again, and came to the horse's head.<br><br>I looked at him with a gaze as flinty as his own. "I'll get up and she'll throw me," I said. "You know that, so do I. And then I'll get on her again and again and again. We'll never train her like that. If you had as much brains inside you as you have beer, you'd let me train her. Then at least we'd have a sweet-natured animal to show this farmer. The way you want to do it we'll show him a whipped idiot."<br><br>I had never spoken to him like that before. My voice was steady but my belly quivered with fright at my daring.<br><br>He looked at me for a long hard moment.<br><br>"Get up," he said. Nothing had changed.<br><br>I waited for one moment, in case I had a chance, or even half a chance, to win my way in this. His face was flinty-hard, and I was only a young girl. I met his gaze for a moment. He could see the fight go out of me.<br><br>I checked he was holding the horse tight at the head and then I turned and gripped hold of the saddle and sprang up.<br><br>As soon as she felt the weight of me on her back she leaped like a mountain goat, stiff-legged sideways, and stood there trembling like a leaf with the shock. Then, as if she had only waited to see that it was not some terrible nightmare, she reared bolt upright to her full height, dragging the reins from Da's hands. Da, like a fool, let go -- as I had known all along he would -- and there was nothing then to control the animal except the halter around her neck. I clung on like a limpet, gripping the pommel of the saddle while she went like a sprinting bullock -- alternately head down and hooves up bucking, and then standing high on her hind legs and clawing the air with her front hooves in an effort to be rid of me. There was nothing in the world to do but to cling on like grim death and hope that Da would be quick enough to catch the trailing reins and get the animal under control before I came off. I saw him coming toward the animal and he was quite close. But the brute wheeled with an awkward sideways shy which nearly unseated me. I was off-balance and grabbing for the pommel of the saddle to get myself into the middle of her back again when she did one of her mighty rears and I went rolling backward to the hard ground below.<br><br>I bunched up as I fell, in an instinctive crouch, fearing the flailing hooves. I felt the air whistle as she kicked out over my head, but she missed by an inch and galloped away to the other side of the field. Da, cursing aloud, went after her, running past me without even a glance in my direction to see how I fared.<br><br>I sat up. My stepmother, Zima, looked at me without interest.<br><br>I got wearily to my feet. I was shaken but not hurt except for the bruises on my back where I had hit the ground. Da had hold of the reins and was whipping the poor animal around the head while she reared and screamed in protest. I watched stony-faced. You'd never catch me wasting sympathy on a horse which had thrown me. Or on anything else.<br><br>"Get up," he said without looking around for me.<br><br>I walked up behind him and looked at the horse. She was a pretty enough animal, half New Forest, half some bigger breed. Dainty, with a bright bay-colored coat which glowed in the sunlight. Her mane and tail were black, coarse and knotted now, but I would wash her before the buyer came. I saw that Dad had whipped her near the eye and a piece of the delicate eyelid was bleeding slightly.<br><br>"You fool," I said in cold disgust. "Now you've hurt her, and it'll show when the buyer comes."<br><br>"Don't you call me a fool, my girl," he said rounding on me, the whip still in his hands. "Another word out of you and you get a beating you won't forget. I've had enough from you for one day. Now get up on that horse and stay on this time."<br><br>I looked at him with the blank insolence which I knew drove him into mindless temper with me. I pushed the tangled mass of my copper-colored hair away from my face and I stared at him with my green eyes as inscrutable as a cat. I saw his hand tighten on the whip and I smiled at him, delighting in my power, even if it lasted for no more than this one morning.<br><br>"And who'd ride her then?" I taunted. "I don't see you getting up on an unbroke horse. And Zima couldn't get on a donkey with a ladder against its side. There's no one who can ride her but me. And I don't choose to this morning. I'll do it this afternoon."<br><br>With that, I turned on my heel and walked away from him, swaying my hips in as close an imitation of my stepmother's languorous slink as I could manage. Done by a skinny fifteen-year-old in a skirt which barely covered her calves, it was far from sensual. But it spoke volumes of defiance to my Da, who let out a great bellow of rage and dropped the horse's reins to come after me.<br><br>He spun me around and shook me until my hair fell over my eyes and I could hardly see his red angry face.<br><br>"You'll do as I order or I'll throw you out!" he said in utter rage. "You'll do as I order or I'll beat you as soon as the horse is sold. You'd better remember that I am as ready to beat you tomorrow night as I am today. I have a long memory for you."<br><br>I shook my head to get the hair out of my eyes, and to clear my mind. I was only fifteen and I could not hold onto courage against Da when he started bullying me. My shoulders slumped and my face lost its arrogance. I knew he would remember this defiance if I did not surrender now. I knew that he would beat me -- not only when the horse was sold, but again every time he remembered it.<br><br>"All right," I said sullenly. "All right. I'll ride her."<br><br>Together we cornered her in the edge of the field and this time he held tighter on to the reins when I was on her back. I stayed on a little longer but again and again she threw me. By the time Dandy was home with a vague secretive smile and a rabbit stolen from someone else's snare dangling from her hand, I was in my bunk covered with bruises, my head thudding with the pain of falling over and over again.<br><br>She brought me a plate of rabbit stew where I lay.<br><br>"Come on out," she invited. "He's all right, he's drinking. And he's got some beer for Zima too, so she's all right. Come on out and we can go down to the river and swim later. That'll help your bruising."<br><br>"No," I said sullenly. "I'm going to sleep. I don't want to come out and I don't care whether he's fair or foul. I hate him. I wish he was dead. And stupid Zima too. I'm staying here, and I'm going to sleep."<br><br>Dandy stretched up so that she could reach me in the top bunk and nuzzled her face against my cheek. "Hurt bad?" she asked softly.<br><br>"Bad on the outside and bad inside," I said, my voice low. "I wish he was dead. I'll kill him myself when I'm bigger."<br><br>Dandy stroked my forehead with her cool dirty hand. "And I'll help you," she said with a ripple of laughter in her voice. "The Ferenz family are nearby; they're going down to the river to swim. Come too, Meridon!"<br><br>I sighed. "Not me," I said. "I'm too sore, and angry. Stay with me, Dandy."<br><br>She brushed the bruise on my forehead with her lips. "Nay," she said sweetly. "I'm away with the Ferenz boys. I'll be back at nightfall."<br><br>I nodded.

And of course the most memorable scene of all&#x2015;red and blue lightsabers flashing, Luke and Darth Vader fight the ultimate battle between good and evil.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a marriage made in a galaxy far, far away: phenomenal Scanimation meets <i>Star Wars</i>, the enduring epic that&#x2019;s sold $42 billion in ticket sales and earned the title #1 Boys Action Toy License of all time. Created by Rufus Butler Seder, <i>Star Wars: A Scanimation Book</i> presents 12 of the most memorable scenes, in a landscape, i.e., movie format. It&#x2019;s an homage from an artist obsessed with the earliest forms of capturing visual motion to an artist obsessed with the most advanced.

De Wohl weaves an intricate tapestry of love, violence and piety to recount with historical accuracy the story of St. Benedict and the tempestuous era in which he lived. Since there are no contemporary biographies of this major saint of history and the Church, de Wohl&#39;s inspired account is of significant importance on the subject of saint&#39;s lives for today&#39;s spiritual seekers. Having lived in an era of great immorality and vice, not unlike our world today, Benedict&#39;s story has a strong message for modern Christians who seek, as he did, to turn away from the wickedness of the world to find Christ in prayer, study and solitude.</p><p></p><h2>Trump and a Post-Truth World</h2><p><b>A provocative and balanced examination of our current social and political situation -- by a cutting-edge philosopher of our times.</b><br><br>The world is in turmoil. As populist waves roil the Brexit-bound U.K., along with Europe, Turkey, Russia, Asia&#x2014;and most visibly, the U.S. with the election of Donald Trump&#x2014;nationalist and extremist political forces threaten the progress made over many decades. Democracies are reeling in the face of nihilism and narcissism. How did we get here? And how, with so much antagonism, cynicism, and discord, can we&nbsp;mend the ruptures in our societies?<br>&nbsp;<br> In this provocative work, philosopher Ken Wilber applies his Integral approach to explain how we arrived where we are and why there is cause for hope.&nbsp; He lays much of the blame on a failure at the progressive, leading edge of society. This leading edge is characterized by the desire to be as just and inclusive as possible, and to it we owe the thrust toward women&#x2019;s rights, the civil rights movement, the environmental movement, and the concern for oppression in all its forms. This is all evolutionarily healthy; what is unhealthy is a creeping postmodernism that is elitist, &#x201c;politically correct,&#x201d; insistent on an egalitarianism that is itself paradoxically hierarchical, and that looks down on &#x201c;deplorables.&#x201d; Combine this with the techno-economic demise of many traditional ways of making a living, and you get an explosive mixture. As Wilber says, for some Trump voters: &#x201c;Everywhere you are told that you are fully equal and deserve immediate and complete empowerment, yet everywhere are denied the means to actually achieve it. You suffocate, you suffer, and you get very, very mad.&#x201d;<br><br> It is only when members of society&#x2019;s leading edge can heal themselves that a new, Integral evolutionary force can emerge to move us beyond the social and political turmoil of our current time to offer genuine leadership toward greater wholeness.</p><p>Ken Wilber is the founder of Integral Institute and the cofounder of Integral Life. He is an internationally acknowledged leader and the preeminent scholar of the Integral stage of human development. He is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>Integral Meditation</i>, <i>A Theory of Everything</i>, <i>Integral Spirituality</i>, <i>No Boundary</i>, <i>Grace and Grit</i>, and <i>Sex, Ecology, Spirituality</i>.&#x201c;Ken Wilber examines Donald Trump&#x2019;s election and provides a brilliant Big Picture explanation that is unique in its breadth, depth, and analysis of deeper cultural dynamics that others have overlooked but that we all need to now recognize.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Walsh MD, PhD, University of California</p><h2>Touched by the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie</h2><p><p><b>The instant <i>New York Times </i>bestseller</b><br><b></b><br><b>A chance encounter at a summer party on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard blossomed into an improbable but enduring friendship. </b></p><p>Carly Simon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis made an unlikely pair&#x2015;Carly, a free and artistic spirit still reeling from her recent divorce, searching for meaning, new love, and an anchor; and Jackie, one of the most celebrated, meticulous, unknowable women in American history. </p><p>Nonetheless, over the next decade their lives merged in inextricable and complex ways, and they forged a connection deeper than either could ever have foreseen.

Such is the case right now with our wounded feeling function- our inability to find joy, worth, and meaning in life. Robert A. Johnson, the celebrated author of 'He, She', and 'We', revisits two medieval tales and illuminates how this feeling function has become a casualty of our modern times.</p><p>Johnson tells the story of the Wounded Fisher King from the Grail Myth to illustrate the anxiety and loneliness that plague men. From the folktale of the Handless Maiden, he explains the very different frustrations of women and describes how these disparities in the way we suffer account for much of the tension and miscommunication between men and women. His insightful analysis shows that these two stories, created centuries ago, are even more relevant today.</p><p>Robert A. Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of 'He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation', and 'Owning Your Own Shadow'.</p></p><p><p> Robert A. Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of <em>He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation,</em> and <em>Owning Your Own Shadow. </em></p>Johnson, whose work will already be familiar to those interested in Jungian thought, specializes (as in his three books <i>He</i>, <i>She</i>, and <i>We</i>) in applying Jung's theories to the relations between men and women. In this slender book, he mines two important tales for what they can tell us about feeling not simply emotion but a grounded sense of values. Everyone in our culture, he argues, is "wounded" in the area of feeling, but the wound is expressed differently among men than among women. To understand the male problem, he examines the figure of the Fisher King from the Grail legends; to understand women's relationship to feeling, he explores the famous folktale of the Handless Maiden pledged to the devil by her own father. A solid contribution to Jungian thought. <i>Pat Monaghan</i></p><h2>The Chicago World&#39;s Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record (Dover Architectural Series)</h2><p>Originally conceived to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America, the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was one of the largest (633 acres) and most influential aggregations of human talent, energy, and industry ever assembled. More than 27 million visitors entered the grounds (now Jackson Park) to marvel at the exhibits and displays housed in some 200 buildings, including those of 79 foreign governments and 38 states. Although the Fair had its share of "firsts" (original Ferris wheel, first midway, Edison's kinetoscope, etc.), its chief marvel was its architecture. It is that aspect which is emphasized in this striking photographic record. <br>Beginning with an overview of the fair's planning and conceptual stages, Stanley Appelbaum's well-researched text then proceeds to a fascinating discussion of the personalities, regional rivalries, and intense controversy surrounding the Beaux-Arts architecture (the "White City" style) of the fair, including its enormous impact on subsequent American architecture. The contributions of such outstanding architects and firms as R. M. Hunt; McKim, Mead and White; Frederick Law Olmsted; and Peabody and Stearns are described. <br>The book then becomes a building-by-building walking tour of the fair &#x2014; imaginatively reconstructed with the help of 128 sharply reproduced rare contemporary photographs, printed on fine coated stock, and a concise, fact-filled text. The placid basins, ponds, and Lagoon that graced the fairgrounds lend a serene aura to these priceless views of the great buildings&nbsp;and sights of the fair: the Beaux-Arts glories of the Administration and Agriculture Buildings; Daniel Chester French's statue of the Republic; the Columbian Fountain by Frederick MacMonnies; the Golden Door of Louis Sullivan's Transportation Building; the Peristyle; Mary Cassatt's mural in the Woman's Building; the pure classicism of the Palace of Fine Arts (now the Museum of Science and Industry); numerous state and foreign pavilions, and of course, the Midway &#x2014; the first separate amusement area at a World's Fair, and the reputed location of Little Egypt's celebrated <i>danse du ventre. </i><br>In the concluding section, the author touches on other memorable aspects of the fair and its times: the Panic of 1893; the Pullman Strike; famous visitors (Archduke Ferdinand, the Spanish Infanta, etc.); cultural and social congresses, and finally, the disastrous fires that ultimately destroyed many of the buildings. For social and cultural historians, Chicagoans, and anyone interested in the special magic of a world's fair, this book is a loving and nostalgic look back &#x2014; to a time bathed in the golden light of the fin-de-si�cle years, when a colossal spectacle of human achievement in art, science, and industry captured the world's attention for one magic and unforgettable moment.</p><p>Stanley Appelbaum served for decades as Dover&#39;s Editor in Chief until his retirement in 1996.

Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform</h2><p>When the landmark Supreme Court case of <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em> was handed down in 1954, many civil rights advocates believed that the decision, which declared public school segregation unconstitutional, would become the Holy Grail of racial justice. Fifty years later, despite its legal irrelevance and the racially separate and educationally ineffective state of public schooling for most black children, <em>Brown</em> is still viewed by many as the perfect precedent.<br><br> Here, Derrick Bell shatters the shining image of this celebrated ruling. He notes that, despite the onerous burdens of segregation, many black schools functioned well and racial bigotry had not rendered blacks a damaged race. He maintains that, given what we now know about the pervasive nature of racism, the Court should have determined instead to rigorously enforce the "equal" component of the "separate but equal" standard. Racial policy, Bell maintains, is made through silent covenants--unspoken convergences of interest and involuntary sacrifices of rights--that ensure that policies conform to priorities set by policy-makers. Blacks and whites are the fortuitous winners or losers in these unspoken agreements. The experience with <em>Brown</em>, Bell urges, should teach us that meaningful progress in the quest for racial justice requires more than the assertion of harms. Strategies must recognize and utilize the interest-convergence factors that strongly influence racial policy decisions.<br><br>In <em>Silent Covenants</em>, Bell condenses more than four decades of thought and action into a powerful and eye-opening book.<br></p><p><br><strong>Derrick Bell</strong> is Visiting Professor of Law at New York University Law School.

He lives in New York City.<br>Bell, the first tenured black professor at Harvard and a veteran civil rights lawyer, reflects critically on the function and limitation of the landmark <i>Brown </i>decision. He asserts that he, like many of his colleagues, confused the means of integration with the objectives of high-quality education and racial equality. To analyze racial reforms, he has developed a theory of converging interests into one of racial fortuity. For example, it was U.S. cold war interests that necessitated the elimination of legal segregation rather than purported concern with quality education for black children. In other words, when the interests of blacks converge with the interests of whites, blacks are more likely to have their needs addressed; otherwise they are not. Thus white resistance to busing and other integration strategies has reduced the <i>Brown </i>decision and its promise to mostly symbolic value. However, Bell admonishes blacks to not forgo their real interests even when they do not converge with the majority, and certainly prime among those interests is the educational development of black children. <i>Vernon Ford</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At mealtimes he is seated at the &#x201c;cat&#x2019;s table&#x201d;&#x2014;as far from the Captain&#x2019;s Table as can be&#x2014;with a ragtag group of &#x201c;insignificant&#x201d; adults and two other boys, Cassius and Ramadhin. As the ship crosses the Indian Ocean, the boys tumble from one adventure to another, bursting all over the place like freed mercury. But there are other diversions as well: they are first exposed to the magical worlds of jazz, women, and literature by their eccentric fellow travelers, and together they spy on a shackled prisoner, his crime and fate a galvanizing mystery that will haunt them forever. By turns poignant and electrifying, <i>The Cat&#x2019;s Table</i> is a spellbinding story about the magical, often forbidden, discoveries of childhood, and a lifelong journey that begins unexpectedly with a spectacular sea voyage.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> Michael Ondaatje's finely wrought new novel chronicles a young boy's passage from Sri Lanka to London onboard the <em>Oronsay</em>, both as it unfolds and in hindsight. Glancing off the author's own biography, the story follows 11-year-old Michael as he immerses himself in the hidden corners and relationships of a temporary floating world, overcoming its physical boundaries with the expanse of his imagination. The boy's companions at the so-called cat's table, where the ship&#x2019;s unconnected strays dine together, become his friends and teachers, each leading him closer to the key that unlocks the <em>Oronsay</em>'s mystery decades later. Elegantly structured and completely absorbing, <em>The Cat's Table</em> is a quiet masterpiece by a writer at the height of his craft. <em>--Mia Lipman<br></em> <br> <p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Abraham Verghese on <em>The Cat's Table</em> by Michael Ondaatje</strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p>One means by which I have kept track of the passage of time is by the appearance of a new Michael Ondaatje book. I&#x2019;ve loved his poetry (and I still know long passages from <em>Secular Love</em> by heart). I love the way his books of poetry or prose, fiction or nonfiction (and some of his books are hybrids that seem to be <em>all</em> those genres in one book) are so carefully crafted. I must have read <em>In the Skin of a Lion</em> 10 times, disassembling it to see how this magic alchemy came about.</p> <p>You can imagine my excitement when <em>The Cat&#x2019;s Table</em>, Ondaatje&#x2019;s latest, arrived on my desk. I found myself reading aloud with a loved one, savoring, just a few pages a day that were carefully rationed. Reading aloud was a way to make every morsel last longer, have it linger on tongue and ear. I can&#x2019;t think of a book I&#x2019;ve read where the sense of a journey&#x2014;in this case, a ship going from Ceylon to England via the Suez Canal&#x2014;is so carefully mirrored in the reader&#x2019;s experience. I had the sense of movement, of a big ship inching away from the shore, and of seeing one&#x2019;s former life recede. At the assigned dinner table (from which the title derives), one meets fellow travelers and the brief bios they present to the world. With each passing day, the narrator finds that these constructed selves give way to something deeper, something overstated, or something dark and ominous, or at other times they modestly conceal a being that is incredibly beautiful and heroic. As the journey progresses, the many characters and the flavors each adds begin to meld together, and I had a sense of the narrative soup <em>thickening</em>, the pace increasing. Indeed, by the last few pages it was as though we had arrived all too soon at the bottom of a most delicious cioppino or bouillabaisse. The fleshy items were dispensed with, the shells all removed, leaving only those last few spoonfuls, and in them a wise world, a complete world, a world distilled. When it was over, I had that sense one lives for as a reader: the feeling of having discovered a truth not just about the imagined world of the novelist, but also about oneself, a truth one can now carry forth into the world, into the rest of one&#x2019;s life....</p> <p>Make haste to get this book, then do what I did: Fill up the tub, ration yourself to a few pages a day, read aloud, preferably to someone as crazy about Ondaatje as you are. Be disciplined. Don&#x2019;t exceed your ration. It is a long voyage but it will go by too soon. So relish.

Spanning doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the question of virtue, human rationality, the nature of the gods and Aurelius&#39; own emotions. The Meditations are a readable exposition of the system of metaphysics known as stoicism. Stoics maintained that by putting aside great passions, unjust thoughts and indulgence, man could acquire virtue and live at one with nature. This classic translation is by A.S.L.

It's an elegant gem in praise of the English sentence.</p><p>Joe Moran is a professor of English and Cultural History at Liverpool John Moores University.<b>1.</b><br><br><b>A Pedant's Apology</b><br><i>Or why I wrote this book</i><br><br>First I write a sentence. I get a tickle of an idea for how the words might come together, like an angler feeling a tug on the rod's line. Then I sound out the sentence in my head. Then I tap it on my keyboard, trying to recall its shape. Then I look at it and say it aloud, to see if it sings. Then I tweak, rejig, shave off a syllable, swap a word for a phrase or a phrase for a word. Then I sit it next to other sentences to see how it behaves in company. And then I delete it all and start again.<br><br>If there were a pie chart that divided up my time on earth, the colored slice that covers writing sentences would be the biggest, apart from the one that covers the thing everyone does: sleeping. I don't count how much writing I have done each day, but if I did I wouldn't count words, I'd count sentences. Sentences are my core output, the little widgets I make in my workshop of words. It helps to think of it like this, as just cranking out a daily quota of sentences, instead of being a <i>writer</i>, which feels like a claim that will need to be stamped and approved. I write maybe three and a half thousand sentences a year. Is this too many, or not enough, or about right? I have no idea. I write one sentence, then another, and repeat until done. I don't know when <i>done </i>is.<br><br>Some writers claim to have sentences in their heads hollering to get out. Flaubert wrote that he was "itching" with them. These writers just seem to have a knack for putting words into right-seeming order, as if it were a skill as randomly allotted as being able to wiggle one's ears. Not me. But I can spot a good tune when I hear it. I know what a good sentence looks and sounds like, so that when I come across one in my own writing I have the good sense not to delete it but to try and replicate it. Having only minor gifts has its compensations. It has forced me to think hard about how words join up and why some sentences work better than others. A nightingale has no idea why such a bewitching noise emerges from its throat; a human nightingale impersonator must parse every note.<br><br>I may give more time to them than most people do, but we are all of us, of school age and older, in the sentences game. Sentences are our writing commons, the shared ground where every writer walks. A poet works with them, but so does the unsung author who came up with <i>Items trapped in doors cause delays</i> or <i>Store in a cool, dry place</i>. Every kind of writer writes in sentences. Even the most clueless or careless strew their writing with capital letters and full stops, in the hope that they will turn what lies between them into this universal currency. By learning to make sentences, we learn not just about writing but about everything. The sentence is where we make the briefest of senses out of this mad, beautiful, befuddling mess: life.<br><br>In 1940 a soon-to-retire Cambridge math don called G. H. Hardy published a defense of his life's work. His field was the purest form of mathematics, number theory, and his book was meant to be a mea culpa for spending his life on something of no practical use that few people would ever understand. In fact, although he called it <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, it was not very apologetic.<br><br>Hardy declared that maths had given him his life's "one great permanent happiness," and that, when the world was immolating itself in war, it offered a consolingly parallel universe of spare, numbered beauty. Applied maths, the kind that could compute the dimensions of the Forth Bridge or the reach of a radio transmitter, he decried as "trivial." Real maths, he thought, bypassed the world in pursuit of pure abstraction. It was useful only rarely and never on purpose. Like Einstein, Hardy felt above all that equations should be beautiful. "A mathematician, like a painter or a poet," he wrote, "is a maker of patterns."<br><br>A mathematical equation and a written sentence have much in common. Both rely on symmetry and balance, often asserting a connection between the seemingly different. Both explain reality in as elegantly concise a form as they can. Both reduce randomness to inevitability, their equal signs or clauses falling into place with a rightness that renders the inchoate and incoherent suddenly clear. Both tell us something about the world outside themselves-but both also swim in their own kind of beauty.<br><br>Pure mathematicians, like Hardy, have long debated whether advances in their field are invented or discovered. Is an elegant equation a piece of human handiwork, or the unearthing of an eternal reality that was there before some fortunate human chanced upon it? The same question might be asked of an elegant sentence, which seems to sit somewhere in this Tom Tiddler's ground between invention and discovery. Like an elegant equation, it has floated free of its maker and feels inevitable. It came out of a single mind but now belongs to the world.<br><br>Fixating on how a sentence looks and sounds, finding the right fit between the thought you want to express and the form it fits inside, can seem as removed from the real world as G. H. Hardy's mathematics. More so, perhaps, because, as Hardy wrote, human languages die but numbers live forever. To care about sentences as Hardy did about math, you must feel about them the way that he felt about numbers. In other words, you must know that, even as they try to explain and account for the world, nothing lies behind them but their own artifice.<br>Hardy's book has been an unlikely inspiration for mine. For this is a book of sentences written in praise of writing sentences. I want it not to school but to hearten, embolden and galvanize the reader-who is almost always, in some way, a writer. I hope it will say something useful about how to write a sentence and put it alongside other sentences. But really it is about why it is worth taking pains over a sentence, in a world where everyone seems to be speaking at once and finishing each other's sentences for them.<br><br>A lesson works best when it doesn't feel like one, when it feels instead like an attempt to repay the favor that was once done to the teacher-in my case, by the writers of other sentences that have instructed me in and delighted me into writing my own. So this book is not a style guide, if that means a series of prescriptions and proscriptions. But perhaps it is a style guide by stealth: one that tries to show what it wants to teach, or to show instead of teaching.<br><br>I was going to call it <i>A Pedant's Apology</i>-a mea culpa for spending my life worrying about something as small and minor- seeming as the sentence. But I am not sure I quite cut it as a pedant. Like most of my generation, my knowledge of grammar is a patchwork, sewn over many years and with thousands of holes in it.<br><br>I am still baffled by those sentence diagrams with the subject on the left and the verb on the right of a horizontal line, and modifiers veering off like motorway slip roads. However hard I try, I cannot link them in my head to actual sentences, the ones that are just a deceptively simple line of words. One of my sixth-form teachers told us that sentence diagrams were as vital to the study of sentences as skeletons were to a medical student studying anatomy. If she was right, then I will never be a doctor of writing. I scrabble my way through my own sentences on hunches and happenstance.<br><br>But then I remind myself that the English sentence belongs to everyone, not just those who like to police other people's use of it. I dislike writing advice that worries only about the sameness of surface features and that minds more about meticulousness than music. The literal meaning of <i>meticulous </i>is "being careful out of fear." Fear feels like the wrong feeling with which to start making sentences. For me it is not the veneration of rules but care for word choice and order that counts. If you get those right then all the rest of it, from dangling modifiers to Oxford commas, will solve itself or cease to matter.<br><br>And yet they do say that poets are pedants in disguise (or is it the other way round?). Even poets with a shaky grip on grammar care about where a comma falls or a full stop comes to rest. They know that it adds not just to the meaning of a line but to its music. For those of us who cannot do number theory, the sentence might be as near as we ever get to orchestrating beauty. A modest beauty, perhaps, which is all a sentence can aim at, but beauty all the same-one that turns the everyday words everyone uses into hard little jewels that glint and gleam together. If this is pedantry, then I plead guilty.<br><br>No one can agree on what a sentence is. The safest definition is typographic. A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop-except that some start with quote marks, and some end with question or exclamation marks, so that doesn't quite work. Let's try again. A sentence is the largest domain over which the rules of grammar have dominion. Thus it stands grammatically apart from the sentences around it. Except when it is a fragment that hangs over from the last sentence as an afterthought. Or that briefly sets a scene, like every sentence of the shipping forecast. <i>Occasional gales. Fog patches. Mainly moderate.</i><br><br>A sentence is a small, sealed vessel for holding meaning. It delivers some news-an assertion, command or question-about the world. Every sentence needs a subject, which is a noun or noun phrase, and a predicate, which is just the bit of the sentence that isn't the subject and that must have a main verb. The subject is usually (but not always) what the sentence is about and the predicate is usually (but not always) what happens to the subject or what it is. <i>This</i> [subject] <i>is a sentence </i>[predicate]. A sentence must have a subject and a main verb, except when it leaves out one or both of them because their presence is implied. OK?<br><br>A sentence can be a single word, or it can stretch into infinity, because more words can be piled on to a main clause for ever. The Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal wrote a whole novel (<i>Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age</i>) containing just one sentence. But he said that his comic sensibility was shaped by a short one he once read on a dry cleaner's receipt:<i> Some stains can be removed only by the destruction of the material itself</i>. Marcel Proust, who in <i>The Captive </i>wrote a 447-word sentence about a sofa, said that he wanted to "weave these long silks as I spin them" and to "encircle the truth with a single-even if long and sinuous-stroke." For Proust, a sentence traced an unbroken line of thought. Cutting it in two broke the line. Depending on its line of thought, a sentence can be a tiny shard of sense or a Proustian demi-world, brought to life and lit up with words.<br><br>For Henry David Thoreau, the sentence was the harvest gleaned in a writer's brain. "The fruit a thinker bears is <i>sentences</i>," he wrote in his journal. For Marianne Moore, the sentence exerted a pull on her "as the pull of a fabric is governed by gravity." For James Baldwin, the one true goal was "to write a sentence as clean as a bone." For John Cheever, "every sentence is an innovation," something never thought, never mind said, in quite that way before. For Annie Dillard, the sentence is a writer's true medium, and a writer with no feel for the sentence is not a writer, because that would be like being a painter who could not bear the smell of paint. For Gary Lutz, the sentence is our "one true theater of endeavor." For Maggie Nelson, the sentence is something to "labor grimly on . . . wondering all the while if prose is but the gravestone marking the forsaking of wildness." For John Banville, the sentence is "this essential piece of our humanness . . . our greatest invention."<br><br>Skilled writers write in sentences-not because sentences are what we all write in (although they are), but because they write small. They see the sentence as the <i>ur</i>-unit, the granular element that must be got right or nothing will be right. Their books, however long they become, are gatherings of sentences. Scientists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krak&#x2014;w analyzed more than a hundred classic works by authors such as Dickens, Joyce and Beckett, and found that the sentences behaved like a mathematical multifractal: a structure whose smallest part resembles its whole. The best writing is self-consistent. It sounds as if it comes from the same breathing body standing in the same place, rather as wine from a certain <i>terroir </i>is said to have, from its climate and soil, a taste irreplicable anywhere else. What special <i>terroir </i>makes a piece of writing irreplicable? Its sentences.<br><br>Dedicated birdwatchers can identify a bird even when they do not have time to note its distinguishing marks of plumage and song. A skilled birder can tell you the breed from its general impression, size and shape, even if it is just a blur flying past in the dusk. A writer's voice is like that, too, perhaps. A skilled reader can spot it from a single sentence flashing by.<br><br>A sentence is more than its meaning. It is a line of words where logic and lyric meet-a piece of both sense and sound, even if that sound is heard only in the head. Things often thought to be peculiar to poetry-meter, rhythm, music-are there in prose as well, or should be. When John Betjeman began a BBC radio talk with the sentence "We came to Looe by unimportant lanes," he must have known it sounded better than "We drove to Looe via the minor roads." His version is ten syllables with the stress on each second syllable: a perfect iambic pentameter.<br><br>Some writers map their sentences metrically, marking the stressed and unstressed syllables with scansion marks as if notating a musical score. Some even work out the stresses before they fill in the words. The rest of us just have a foggy sense that a sentence needs an extra beat. But we still know that a sentence is not just what it says but how it says it. Robert Frost called this its "sound of sense," the emotional truth you could grasp even if you heard the sentence spoken by a muffled voice in another room. Here, he felt, beneath the mere grammatical obedience, were "the brute tones of our human throat that may once have been all our meaning."</p><h2>The American Cinema</h2><p><b>"<i>The American Cinema </i>is the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of film criticism, a brilliant book that elevated American directors from craftsmen to artists, launched the careers of numerous film critics, and shaped the aesthetics of a whole generation of viewers by providing new ways of looking at movies."--Emanuel Levy, author of <i>George Cukor, Master of Elegance</i></b><br><br>The auteur theory, of which film critic Andrew Sarris was the leading American proponent, holds that artistry in cinema can be largely attributed to film directors, who, while often working against the strictures of studios, producers, and scriptwriters, manage to infuse each film in their oeuvre with their personal style. Sarris's <i>The American Cinema</i>, the bible of auteur studies, is a history of American film in the form of a lively guide to the work of two hundred film directors, from Griffith, Chaplin, and von Sternberg to Mike Nichols, Stanley Kubrick, and Jerry Lewis. In addition, the book includes a chronology of the most important American films, an alphabetical list of over 6000 films with their directors and years of release, and the seminal essays "Toward a Theory of Film History" and "The Auteur Theory Revisited." Over twenty-five years after its initial publication, <i>The American Cinema </i>remains perhaps the most influential book ever written on the subject.</p><p>Since its publication in 1968, <i>The American Cinema</i> has been the manifesto of the auteur theory. Written by Andrew Sarris, the theory's chief advocate, the book traces the history of movies by examining the careers of more than 200 film directors. Covering everyone from D.W. Griffith to Francis Coppola, Orson Welles to Roman Polanski, Sarris argues that directorial greatness is marked by a personal style and consistency of excellence that can be traced throughout a career. Sarris's commentary is sometimes worshipful, sometimes acrid, but almost always quotable. Alfred Hitchcock is "the supreme technician of the American cinema." John Huston coasted "on his reputation as a wronged individualist with an alibi for every bad movie." Stanley Kubrick holds "a naive faith in the power of images to transcend fuzzy feelings and vague ideas." Michelangelo Antonioni makes films so pessimistic and alienating that Sarris dubs him "Antoniennui."<p> You may not agree with all of Sarris's assessments, but this book provides the best possible opportunity to consider auteurism, an approach to cinema that, in an age that reveres Scorsese, Spielberg, and Tarantino, seems more relevant than ever. The book closes with an essay called "The Auteur Theory Revised," Sarris's attempt at a definitive theoretical statement. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p><b>Andrew Sarris </b>is film critic for the <i>New York Observer</i> and professor of cinema at Columbia University.

This historical novel unlocks the mystery of Britain's most haunting and puzzling structure, and tells a tale of three brothers&#x2014;fierce rivals&#x2014;who are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. Lengar, the eldest brother, kills his own father to become chief of his tribe. Camaban, the illegitimate middle brother, is determined to have a massive temple built in his own honor. And Saban, the youngest, who actually builds Stonehenge, must act as mediator between the other two. Stonehenge is the enthrallingly dramatic story of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry; and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.</p></p><p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>. He lives with his wife on Cape Cod and in Charleston, South Carolina. </p>Three brothers, Lengar, warrior-chief; Camaban, crippled sorcerer; and Saban, peace-loving artisan, are the mighty pillars around which this epic novel is constructed. Bernard Cornwell transports the reader back to a time four thousand years ago, as he creates a landscape, a civilization, a reason, and the method to explain Stonehenge, the sun's great stone temple, and how it was made. Sean Barrett reads quickly, but such is the delicate enunciation of his words that there is never a sense of hurry. Barrett paints portraits with his voice, showing in sound the intelligence and nobility of Saban, the growing madness of Camaban, and the lascivious brutality of Lengar, and the distinctive qualities of numerous other characters. There are few things as satisfying as a good epic novel. STONEHENGE is such a book. It is gratifying that it is being released in both print and audio formats simultaneously.

A true game warden adventure storyIt surprises many who read my stories to learn of the great diversity of challenges faced by California's Fish and Game wardens. This is probably due to the general misconception of many as to the true nature of this state, the perception that California is mainly urban when in fact the reverse is true. In truth, California has more natural diversity of wildlife and wildlife habitat than any other state and is second only to Alaska in its vast expanses of wilderness.Readers are also surprised to discover how hazardous my profession can be. Out of necessity, wardens work alone much of the time, often at night, with absolutely no hope for timely backup should things go wrong. And things go wrong, somewhere in the state, with distressing regularity. The dangers of this work are best illustrated by rather grim FBI statistics which clearly show that game wardens and conservation officers in this country are at greater risk of being assaulted or killed in the line of duty than are most sheriff's deputies and police officers.</p><p>Award winning author Terry Hodges was himself a California State Fish and Game warden and supervisor/leader of game wardens for over 30 intense years.

Rather than leading to a deeper understanding of our universe, this worldview actually undermines real science and marginalizes morality and religion.</p> <p>In this book, celebrated philosopher J. P. Moreland exposes the selfdefeating nature of scientism and equips us to recognize scientism's harmful presence in different aspects of culture, emboldening our witness to biblical Christianity and arming us with strategies for the integration of faith and science--the only feasible path to genuine knowledge.</p></p><p><p><strong>J. P. Moreland</strong> (PhD, University of Southern California) is distinguished professor of philosophy at Biola University. He is an author of, contributor to, or editor of over ninety books, including <em>The Soul: How We Know It's Real and Why It Matters</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;Science is a wonderfully useful discipline, but in recent times it has been distorted into <i>scientism</i>, the view that science is the ultimate path to truth in any area of reality. Based on that false adulation of science, many have denied the value of religion and philosophy, and many have rejected the claims of divine revelation in the Bible. J. P. Moreland is a respected Christian thinker who has studied both science and the Scriptures in considerable depth. He clearly demonstrates the fallacies of the arguments for scientism. He shows how Christians can defend their faith against scientistic objections, while affirming genuine science as a gift from God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John M. Frame</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando</p><p>&#x201c;Scientism is a silent killer. Despite its name, it is neither scientific nor rational. Yet it attempts to kill our knowledge of God and the good life by claiming that the methods of science are sufficient for any knowledge we may need to know. J. P. Moreland, one of our greatest living philosophers, exposes scientism for what it is&#x2015;a self-refuting and knowledge-stopping claim. This judgment in no way undermines real science, but rather encourages it. Once more, we are in Moreland&#x2019;s debt.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Douglas Groothuis</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor of Philosophy, Denver Seminary; author, <em>The Soul in Cyberspace</em></p><p>&#x201c;Moreland offers a brilliant critique of scientism and a comprehensive defense of theistic science. As valuable as this critique and defense is, I believe his book&#x2019;s greatest contribution is his wake-up call to Christian leaders of how &#x2018;scientism has forced the church to offer the gospel simply because it works rather than because it is true and can be known as such.&#x2019; Kudos to Moreland for equipping us to know through scientific evidence and philosophical reasoning that the Bible and the gospel indeed are true.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Hugh Ross</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Reasons to Believe; author, <em>The Creator and the Cosmos</em>; <em>Improbable Planet</em>; and <em>Why the Universe Is the Way It Is</em></p><p>&#x201c;J. P. Moreland is one of the great Christian philosophers of our time. He has shown persuasively that we can know God just as well as we can know anything else. If, as philosophers tell as, knowledge constitutes &#x2018;justified true belief,&#x2019; Moreland has shown that we can have such beliefs about God&#x2015;and, thus, objective, as well as subjective, knowledge of him. In this trenchant critique, he shows not only how the ideology of scientism undermines the justifiable confidence that people should have in their knowledge of God, but that scientism ultimately defeats itself. Scientism claims that hard sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology provide the only genuine knowledge of reality. Yet, as Moreland shows, scientism does not satisfy its own requirement, because it is not itself based upon scientific evidence or scientific method. Instead, Moreland shows with many concrete examples that many people in our culture simply <i>assume</i> that the hard sciences provide the only foundation for knowledge, leaving them with an impoverished and materialistic view of reality that denies them the joy, hope, and meaning that comes from the knowledge of God. For this reason, <i>Scientism and Secularism</i> is a philosophical treatise with a practical message for anyone wanting to live life more abundantly in accord with genuine knowledge of God. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stephen C. Meyer</strong><strong>,</strong> Director, Center for Science and Culture, Discovery Institute; <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author, <em>Darwin&#x2019;s Doubt</em></p><p>&#x201c;Science is a gift from God, but scientism is an idolatrous perversion of that gift that is hostile to the Christian faith and to the proper practice of science. J. P. Moreland rightly contends that Christians need to understand what scientism claims, to recognize its pervasive effects in our society, and to expose its self-defeating pretensions. Moreland has been reflecting on these issues for decades, and I can think of no one better qualified to write on this topic. This incisive takedown of scientism is long overdue and most welcome.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>James N. Anderson</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor of Theology and Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve ever been tempted to dismiss a moral, philosophical, or theological belief because you were convinced only science gives real knowledge&#x2015;or if it&#x2019;s been done to you&#x2015;then you&#x2019;ve been taken in by scientism. This popular notion has crippled the confidence of multitudes of Christians, yet in <i>Scientism and Secularism</i>, philosopher J. P. Moreland handily exposes it for the fraud it is. Moreland cuts through the confusion with his characteristic clarity, insight, and surgical precision, deftly refuting the notion that only science can give knowledge while all else is mere opinion, feeling, or faith. Here is Moreland doing what he does best&#x2015;dispatching foolishness with careful thought and rigorous assessment. For those taken in by the silliness of scientism, this book will be an eye-opener. Moreland&#x2019;s effort also serves as a tutorial in the disappearing art of clear thinking for those floundering in the murky waters of secularism.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregory Koukl</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Stand to Reason; author, <em>The Story of Reality</em> and <em>Tactics</em></p><p>&#x201c;J. P. Moreland&#x2019;s <i>Scientism and Secularism</i> should be mandatory reading for serious Christians who want to intelligently engage in the interface of philosophy and science. Moreland elegantly guides the reader through concepts typically reserved for serious analytic philosophers and academics. In doing so, he provides a desperately needed and highly accessible treatment of elite-level arguments that both seasoned philosophy veterans and enthusiastic amateurs will enjoy. Moreland thus demonstrates a rare ability to distill complicated and abstract philosophical concepts into a framework for everybody to understand. While scientists who are not philosophically inclined always tend to deride approaches that are not strictly empirical as superfluous, in recent years this tendency has accelerated. Major figures in both academic and popular science characterize philosophy as an anachronism to be abandoned, with only experimental or observable data worthy of discussion. Moreland argues expertly that not only are such claims internally inconsistent, this central dogma of scientism erodes the serious pursuit of knowledge. Scientism isn&#x2019;t just poor science, it&#x2019;s poor thinking. Moreland has crafted an eminently readable text that clearly demonstrates that this kind of crude scientistic thinking should be eschewed by all thinkers not dogmatically committed to worshiping at the altar of reductive physicalism. <i>Scientism and Secularism</i> is a book that should be read by any serious Christian who is motivated to integrate science, philosophy, and faith cogently and cohesively.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD</strong><strong>,</strong> coauthor, <em>The Mind and the Brain</em> and <em>You Are Not Your Brain</em></p><p>&#x201c;The greatest barrier to communicating a Christian message in our day is the fact/value split. It decrees that truth is to be found only in the fact realm, while relegating morality and theology to the realm of values, which it defines as subjective, private, personal preferences. The result is that when Christian speak, people do not even &#x2018;hear&#x2019; them making objective truth claims. That&#x2019;s why this book by J. P. Moreland is so important. Moreland challenges the fact/value split, showing that it rests on the untenable assumption of scientism. Then he makes a persuasive case that fields like philosophy, morality, and theology yield genuine knowledge.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy Pearcey</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>Total Truth</em>; <em>Finding Truth</em>; and <em>Love Thy Body</em></p><p>&#x201c;With cross-disciplinary depth and precise argument, J. P. Moreland not only puts science back in its lane, he defines the lane&#x2015;and in doing so rescues true science from self-destructive overreach. Anyone responsible for educating the next generation of scientists, theologians, or anyone in between needs this surprisingly readable book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Schmus</strong><strong>,</strong> Executive Director, Christian Educators Association International</p><p>&#x201c;For decades, people have been weighing in on why children are leaving the faith in droves. J. P. Moreland gets to the core and offers information needed to stop the exodus.

Punctually, they came&#x2014;so punctually, she really could tell the time by them: the woman with the crooked back, on Mondays at ten; the wounded soldier, on Thursdays at eleven. On Tuesdays at one an elderly man came, with a fey-looking boy to help him: Kay enjoyed watching for them. She liked to see them making their slow way up the street: the man neat and dark-suited as an undertaker, the boy patient, serious, handsome&#x2014;like an allegory of youth and age, she thought, as done by Stanley Spencer or some finicky modern painter like that. After them there came a woman with her son, a little lame boy in spectacles; after that, an elderly Indian lady with rheumatics. The little lame boy would sometimes stand scuffing up moss and dirt from the broken path to the house with his great boot, while his mother spoke with Mr Leonard in the hall. Once, recently, he&#x2019;d looked up and seen Kay watching; and she&#x2019;d heard him making a fuss on the stairs, then, about going on his own to the lavatory.</p><p>&#x2018;Is it them angels on the door?&#x2019; she had heard his mother say. &#x2018;Good heavens, they&#x2019;re only pictures! A great boy like you!&#x2019;</p><p>Kay guessed it wasn&#x2019;t Mr Leonard&#x2019;s lurid Edwardian angels that frightened him, but the thought of encountering her. He must have supposed she haunted the attic floor like a ghost or a lunatic.</p><p>He was right, in a way. For sometimes she walked restlessly about, just as lunatics were said to. And other times she&#x2019;d sit still, for hours at a time&#x2014;stiller than a shadow, because she&#x2019;d watch the shadows creeping across the rug. And then it seemed to her that she really might be a ghost, that she might be becoming part of the faded fabric of the house, dissolving into the gloom that gathered, like dust, in its crazy angles.</p><p>A train ran by, two streets away, heading into Clapham Junction; she felt the thrill and shudder of it in the sill beneath her arms. The bulb in a lamp behind her shoulder sprang into life, flickered for a second like an irritated eye, and then went out. The clinker in the fireplace&#x2014;a brutal little fireplace; this had been a room for a servant, once&#x2014;gently collapsed. Kay took a final draw on her cigarette, then pinched out the flame of it between her forefinger and thumb.</p><p>She had been standing at her window for more than an hour. It was a Tuesday: she&#x2019;d seen a snub-nosed man with a wasted arm arrive, and had been waiting, in a vague kind of way, for the Stanley Spencer couple. But now she&#x2019;d decided to give up on them. She&#x2019;d decided to go out. The day was fine, after all: a day in the middle of a warm September, the third September after the war. She went through to the room, next to this one, that she used as a bedroom, and began to get changed.</p><p>The room was dim. Some of the window-glass had been lost, and Mr Leonard had replaced it with lino. The bed was high, with a balding candlewick bedspread: the sort of bed that turned your thoughts, not pleasantly, to the many people who must, over the years, have slept on it, made love on it, been born on it, died on it, thrashed around on it in fevers. It gave off a slightly sour scent, like the feet of worn stockings. But Kay was used to that, and didn&#x2019;t notice. The room was nothing to her but a place in which to sleep or to lie sleepless. The walls were empty, featureless, just as they had been when she&#x2019;d moved in. She&#x2019;d never hung up a picture or put out books; she had no pictures or books; she didn&#x2019;t have much of anything. Only, in one of the corners, had she fixed up a length of wire; and on this, on wooden hangers, she kept her clothes.</p><p>The clothes, at least, were very neat. She picked her way through them now and found a pair of nicely darned socks, and some tailored slacks. She changed her shirt to a cleaner one, a shirt with a soft white collar she could leave open at the throat, as a woman might.</p><p>But her shoes were men&#x2019;s shoes; she spent a minute polishing them up. And she put silver links in her cuffs, then combed her short brown hair with brushes, making it neat with a touch of grease. People seeing her pass in the street, not looking at her closely, often mistook her for a good-looking youth. She was regularly called &#x2018;young man&#x2019;, and even &#x2018;son&#x2019;, by elderly ladies. But if anyone gazed properly into her face, they saw at once the marks of age there, saw the white threads in her hair; and in fact she would be thirty-seven on her next birthday.</p><p>When she went downstairs she stepped as carefully as she could, so as not to disturb Mr Leonard; but it was hard to be soft-footed, because of the creaking and popping of the stairs. She went to the lavatory, then spent a couple of minutes in the bathroom, washing her face, brushing her teeth. Her face was lit up rather greenishly, because ivy smothered the window. The water knocked and spluttered in the pipes. The geyser had a spanner hanging beside it, for sometimes the water stuck completely&#x2014;and then you had to bang the pipes about a bit to make it fire.</p><p>The room beside the bathroom was Mr Leonard&#x2019;s treatment-room, and Kay could hear, above the sound of the toothbrush in her own mouth and the splash of water in the basin, his passionate monotone, as he worked on the snub-nosed man with the wasted arm. When she let herself out of the bathroom and went softly past his door, the monotone grew louder. It was like the throb of some machine.</p><p>&#x2018;Eric,&#x2019; she caught, &#x2018;you must hmm-hmm. How can buzz-buzz when hmm-buzz whole again?&#x2019;</p><p>She stepped very stealthily down the stairs, opened the unlatched front door, and stood for a moment on the step&#x2014;almost hesitating, now. The whiteness of the sky made her blink. The day seemed limp, suddenly: not fine so much as dried out, exhausted. She thought she could feel dust, settling already on her lips, her lashes, in the corners of her eyes. But she wouldn&#x2019;t turn back. She had, as it were, her own brushed hair to live up to; her polished shoes, her cuff-links. She went down the steps and started to walk. She stepped like a person who knew exactly where they were going, and why they were going there&#x2014;though the fact was, she had nothing to do, and no one to visit, no one to see. Her day was a blank, like all of her days. She might have been inventing the ground she walked on, laboriously, with every step.</p><p>She headed west, through well-swept, devastated streets, towards Wandsworth.</p><p>No sign of Colonel Barker today, Uncle Horace,&#x2019; said Duncan, looking up at the attic windows as he and Mr Mundy drew closer to the house.</p><p>He was rather sorry. He liked to see Mr Leonard&#x2019;s lodger. He liked the bold cut of her hair, her mannish clothes, her sharp, distinguished-looking profile. He thought she might once have been a lady pilot, a sergeant in the WAAF, something like that: one of those women, in other words, who&#x2019;d charged about so happily during the war, and then got left over. &#x2018;Colonel Barker&#x2019; was Mr Mundy&#x2019;s name for her. He liked to see her standing there, too. At Duncan&#x2019;s words he looked up and nodded; but then he put down his head again and moved on, too out of breath to speak.</p><p>He and Duncan had come all the way to Lavender Hill from White City. They had to come slowly, getting buses, stopping to rest; it took almost the whole day to get here and home again afterwards. Duncan had Tuesday as his regular day off, and made the hours up on a Saturday. They were very good about it, at the factory where he worked. &#x2018;That boy&#x2019;s devoted to his uncle!&#x2019; he&#x2019;d heard them say, many times. They didn&#x2019;t know that Mr Mundy wasn&#x2019;t actually his uncle. They had no idea what kind of treatment he received from Mr Leonard; probably they thought he went to a hospital. Duncan let them think what they liked.</p><p>He led Mr Mundy into the shadow of the crooked house. The house always looked at its most alarming, he thought, when looming over you like this. For it was the last surviving building in what had once, before the war, been a long terrace; it still had the scars, on either side, where it had been attached to its neighbours, the zig-zag of phantom staircases and the dints of absent hearths. What held it up, Duncan couldn&#x2019;t imagine; he&#x2019;d never quite been able to shake off the feeling, as he let himself and Mr Mundy into the hall, that he&#x2019;d one day close the door a shade too hard and the whole place would come tumbling down around them.</p><p>So he closed the door softly; and after that the house seemed more ordinary. The hall was dim and rather hushed; there were hard-backed chairs set all the way around it, a coatless coat-rack, and two or three pallid-looking plants; the floor was a pattern of white-and-black tiles, some of which had got lost, exposing the grey cement beneath. The shade of the light was a lovely rose-coloured porcelain shell&#x2014;meant for a gas-lamp, probably, but now fitted up with a bulb in a bakelite socket and a fraying brown flex.</p><p>Duncan noticed flaws and features like this; it was one of the pleasures of life for him. The earlier they arrived at the house, the more he liked it, for that gave him time to help Mr Mundy to a chair and then wander quietly around the hall, looking everything over. He admired the finely turned banisters, and the stair-rods with their tarnished brass ends. He liked the discoloured ivory knob on a cupboard door, and the paint on the skirting-boards, which had been combed to look like wood. But at the back of the passage that led to the basement was a bamboo table, set out with tawdry ornaments; and amongst the plaster dogs and cats, the paperweights and majolica vases, was his favourite thing of all: an old lustre bowl, very beautiful, with a design of serpents and fruits. Mr Leonard kept dusty walnuts in it, with a pair of iron nutcrackers on the top, and Duncan never approached the bowl without feeling, as if in the fibres of his bones, the fatal little concussion that would occur if some careless person were to take the nutcrackers up and let them slip against the china.</p><p>The walnuts sat in the bowl today just as usual, however, the layer of dust upon them woolly, undisturbed; and Duncan had time, too, to look quite closely at a couple of pictures hanging crookedly on the wall&#x2014;for everything hung crookedly, in this house. They turned out to be rather commonplace, with very ordinary Oxford frames. But that gave him a sense of pleasure, too&#x2014;a different sort of pleasure&#x2014;the pleasure he got from looking at a moderately handsome thing and thinking, You&#x2019;re not mine, and I don&#x2019;t have to want you!</p><p>When there was movement in the room upstairs, he stepped nimbly back to Mr Mundy&#x2019;s side. A door had opened on the landing, and he heard voices: it was Mr Leonard, seeing out the young man who always had the hour before them. Duncan liked seeing this man, almost as much as he liked seeing Colonel Barker and the lustre bowl; for the man was cheery. He might be a sailor. &#x2018;All right, mates?&#x2019; he said today, giving Duncan a bit of a wink. He asked what the weather was doing now, and enquired after Mr Mundy&#x2019;s arthritis&#x2014;all the while removing a cigarette from its packet, then putting it to his mouth, taking out a box of matches and striking a light: all perfectly easily and naturally with one hand, while the other, undeveloped arm hung at his side.</p><p>Why did he come, Duncan always wondered, when he could get along so well just as he was? He thought that perhaps the young man wanted a sweetheart; for of course, the arm was something a girl might object to.</p><p>The young man tucked the box of matches back into his pocket and went on his way. Mr Leonard led Duncan and Mr Mundy upstairs&#x2014;going slowly, of course; letting Mr Mundy set the pace.</p><p>&#x2018;Blinking nuisance,&#x2019; said Mr Mundy. &#x2018;What can you do with me? Put me on the scrap-heap.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Now, now!&#x2019; said Mr Leonard.</p><p>He and Duncan helped Mr Mundy into the treatment-room. They lowered him into another hard-backed chair, took his jacket from him, made sure he was comfortable. Mr Leonard got out a black notebook and looked briefly inside it; then he sat facing Mr Mundy in a stiff chair of his own. Duncan went to the window and sat on a low sort of padded box that was there, with Mr Mundy&#x2019;s jacket in his lap. The window had a bitter-smelling net curtain across it, slightly sagging from a wire. The walls of the room were done in lincrusta, painted a glossy chocolate brown.</p><p>Mr Leonard rubbed his hands together. &#x2018;So,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;How are we, since I saw you last?&#x2019;</p><p>Mr Mundy ducked his head. &#x2018;Not too bright,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>&#x2018;The idea of pains, still?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t seem to shake them off at all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But you&#x2019;ve had no resort to false remedies of any kind?&#x2019;</p><p>Mr Mundy moved his head again, uneasily. &#x2018;Well,&#x2019; he admitted after a second, &#x2018;perhaps a little aspirin.&#x2019;</p><p>Mr Leonard drew in his chin and looked at Mr Mundy as if to say: Dear, dear. &#x2018;Now, you know very well, don&#x2019;t you,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;what a person is like, who employs false remedies and spiritual treatment at the same time? He is like an ass pulled by two masters; he moves nowhere. You do know this, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s only,&#x2019; said Mr Mundy, &#x2018;so awfully sore&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Soreness!&#x2019; said Mr Leonard, with a mixture of amusement and great contempt. He shook his chair. &#x2018;Is this chair sore, because it must support my weight? Why not, since the wood from which it is made is as material as the bone and muscle of your leg, which you say hurts from bearing your weight? It is because nobody believes that a chair mayhurt. If you will only not believe in the hurt of your leg, that leg will become as negligible to you as wood is. Don&#x2019;t you know this?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; said Mr Mundy meekly.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; repeated Mr Leonard. &#x2018;Now, let us make a start.&#x2019;</p><p>Duncan sat very still. It was necessary to be very still and quiet through all of the session, but particularly now, while Mr Leonard was gathering his thoughts, gathering his strength, concentrating his mind so that he might be ready to take on the false idea of Mr Mundy&#x2019;s arthritis. He did this by slightly putting back his head and looking with great intensity, not at Mr Mundy, but at a picture he had hung over the mantelpiece, of a soft-eyed woman in a high-necked Victorian gown, whom Duncan knew to be the founder of Christian Science, Mrs Mary Baker Eddy. On the black frame of the picture someone&#x2014;possibly Mr Leonard himself&#x2014;had written a phrase, not very handily, in enamel paint. The phrase was: Ever Stand Porter at the Gate of Thought.</p><p>The words made Duncan want to laugh, every time: not because he found them especially comical, but simply because to laugh, just now, would be so dreadful; and he always, at this point, began to grow panicked at the thought of having to sit so silently, for so long: he felt he would be bound to make some sound, some movement&#x2014;leap up, start shrieking, throw a fit...But it was too late. Mr Leonard had changed his pose&#x2014;had leant forward and fixed Mr Mundy with his gaze. And when he spoke again, he spoke in a whisper, intently, with a tremendous sense of urgency and belief.</p><p>&#x2018;...</p></p><h2>All the Great Prizes: The Life of John Hay, from Lincoln to Roosevelt</h2><p>The first full-scale biography of John Hay since 1934: From secretary to Abraham Lincoln to secretary of state for Theodore Roosevelt, Hay was an essential American figure for more than half a century.<i></i><br><br>John Taliaferro&#x2019;s brilliant biography captures the extraordinary life of Hay, one of the most amazing figures in American history, and restores him to his rightful place. Private secretary to Lincoln and secretary of state to Theodore Roosevelt, Hay was both witness and author of many of the most significant chapters in American history&#x2014;from the birth of the Republican Party, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, to the prelude to World War I. As an ambassador and statesman, he guided many of the country&#x2019;s major diplomatic initiatives at the turn of the twentieth century: the Open Door with China, the creation of the Panama Canal, and the establishment of America as a world leader.<br> <br>Hay&#x2019;s friends are a who&#x2019;s who of the era: Mark Twain, Horace Greeley, Henry Adams, Henry James, and virtually every president, sovereign, author, artist, power broker, and robber baron of the Gilded Age. His peers esteemed him as &#x201c;a perfectly cut stone&#x201d; and &#x201c;the greatest prime minister this republic has ever known.&#x201d; But for all his poise and polish, he had his secrets. His marriage to one of the wealthiest women in the country did not prevent him from pursuing the Madame X of Washington society, whose other secret suitor was Hay&#x2019;s best friend, Henry Adams.<br> <br><i>All the Great Prizes</i>, the first authoritative biography of Hay in eighty years, renders a rich and fascinating portrait of this brilliant American and his many worlds.</p><p>John Taliaferro is a graduate of Harvard College, a former senior editor at <i>Newsweek</i>, and the author of four previous books. He lives in Austin, Texas, and Pray, Montana.All the Great Prizes CHAPTER 1<p></p> Oughtnottobiography<p></p> <br>The White House would never be the same.<br> <br>To those who worked there, it was an &#x201c;ill-kept, inconvenient, and dirty old rickety concern,&#x201d; made even shabbier by the heavy footfalls and hard use of civil war. But for all its disarray, it had been John Hay&#x2019;s home. For four years he and his fellow private secretary, John George Nicolay, had shared a bedroom across the hall from the president&#x2019;s office, and throughout the war no one had lived more intimately with the Lincolns; no one had witnessed more closely the toll of work and worry and death&#x2014;of a son and of three quarters of a million of the nation&#x2019;s sons&#x2014;upon Abraham Lincoln.<br> <br>To be sure, not every day had been dark, and Lincoln&#x2019;s spirit had not always been so somber. On the occasions, spontaneous and evanescent, when Lincoln&#x2019;s native humor had shown forth, it radiated most directly on the two secretaries&#x2014;Nicolay an earnest twenty-nine and Hay a callow twenty-two when they first accompanied the president from Springfield in 1861. With unconditional devotion and respect, Hay and Nicolay had taken to calling their Zeus-like employer &#x201c;the Tycoon&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Ancient.&#x201d;<br> <br>But now in May of 1865 they too were a good deal more ancient. And Lincoln was dead. A month after the assassination, the White House seemed like a corpse itself, laid out in the clothes of a stranger.<br> <br>Of the two secretaries, Hay had been struck more bluntly by the murder. Nicolay was away from Washington on April 14, when the president and Mrs. Lincoln went to Ford&#x2019;s Theatre. Hay had remained at the White House with Robert Lincoln, the president&#x2019;s eldest son. Over the past five years, Robert had spent little time with his father&#x2014;off at boarding school in 1859 as Lincoln prepared to run for the presidency; away at college in 1860 when Lincoln won his party&#x2019;s nomination and then the national election; gone for nearly the entire Civil War. After Robert&#x2019;s graduation in 1864, his father found him a place, out of harm&#x2019;s way, on the staff of Ulysses S. Grant, and Robert had been with Grant at Appomattox when Robert E. Lee gave up his sword. Robert and John Hay had known each other for quite a while, and there could easily have been cause for awkwardness between them. Hay in many respects was closer to the president, knew him better than did the twenty-one-year-old captain home from the war. But to the credit of both, there was no uneasiness at all.<br> <br>On that fateful Good Friday, the two young men were upstairs in the White House, catching up, when a doorman burst in with the news, &#x201c;[S]omething happened to the President.&#x201d; Robert and Hay hurried by carriage to the boardinghouse where Lincoln lay unconscious with a bullet through his brain. There they remained throughout the night, as doctors probed and Mrs. Lincoln sobbed. They were at the president&#x2019;s bedside at seven the following morning, when he stopped breathing. Indelibly, Hay remembered Secretary of War Edwin Stanton uttering, &#x201c;Now he belongs to the ages.&#x201d;<br> <br>The corpse was taken to the White House, where, in an upstairs bedroom, embalmers drained its blood and doctors autopsied the skull. In the hours that followed, Stanton and the other cabinet members (except Secretary of State William Seward, who had been quite nearly slain by one of John Wilkes Booth&#x2019;s accomplices) rallied to take charge of the federal government and to arrange for Lincoln&#x2019;s funeral. The job of handling the president&#x2019;s personal affairs fell jointly to Robert Lincoln and John Hay. Hay suggested to newly sworn President Andrew Johnson that, under the circumstances, Mrs. Lincoln and the family ought to be allowed to remain in the White House for as long as they wished, and when Johnson&#x2019;s emissary appeared later in the morning, he found Robert in the presidential office, standing amid his father&#x2019;s papers. Abraham Lincoln might belong to the ages, but much of the contents of his office now belonged to his family.<br> <br>Hay stood beside Robert in those first numbed days after the assassination, and when Nicolay at last arrived, he pitched in as well. Hay and Nicolay had been in charge of most aspects of Lincoln&#x2019;s workday. They had handled nearly every military order, every letter and telegram, every request for appointment, promotion, and pardon that crossed Lincoln&#x2019;s desk. They had transcribed his letters and speeches. Nicolay, German-born, was the more organized of the two private secretaries and much stiffer in manner and expression. Hay was the stylish one, dapper and erudite, with the pen of a poet. Mastering Lincoln&#x2019;s signature had been easy for him; what now seems likely is that he also wrote a good many of the letters that went out above Lincoln&#x2019;s signature, including at least one letter regarded today as a gem of Lincolniana.<br> <br>Indeed, Hay and Nicolay had a vested interest in the papers of Abraham Lincoln, for, with the consent of the president, they had filed away Lincoln&#x2019;s correspondence and other writings with the aim of eventually writing a book about him. Though the assassination had been jarring in the extreme, they never lost sight of their objective. While undertakers dressed Lincoln&#x2019;s body for public viewing in the East Room of the White House, Hay and Nicolay made a careful appraisal of the president&#x2019;s effects. Once Lincoln&#x2019;s widow and sons left the White House, Robert Lincoln would become the new custodian of the presidential papers, with the understanding that he would make them available to the two secretaries&#x2014;to them and nobody else. They signed no agreement; Hay&#x2019;s friendship with Robert was assurance enough.<br> <br>Hay and Nicolay&#x2019;s own eviction from the White House was scarcely a surprise. They were both leaving anyway. As strong as the bond had been between Lincoln and his private secretaries, Mary Lincoln, vengeful and devious, had made life difficult for them from the start, and she had made it quite obvious that she did not want them around for her husband&#x2019;s second term of office. Hay and Nicolay did not protest. They were thoroughly drained from four years of relentless, at times crushing, toil and stress, and only too ready to move on. The week after the inauguration, Nicolay had been appointed consul to Paris. Hay, too, was going to Paris, as secretary of legation. The jobs had been promised before Lincoln&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>Yet neither bright prospects abroad nor an understanding with Robert Lincoln on the presidential papers made the final days in Washington any less dreary. On April 24, five days after Lincoln&#x2019;s funeral, Nicolay wrote to his fianc�e: &#x201c;Words seem so inadequate to express my own personal sorrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think that I do not yet, and probably shall not yet for a long while, realize what a change his death has wrought in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the personal relations of almost every one connected with the government in this city who stood near to him.&#x201d; Nicolay added, &#x201c;Hay and I are still here arranging the papers of the office, which has kept us very busy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meanwhile, Lincoln&#x2019;s body wended its way, first northward, then westward, taking more than two weeks to reach Springfield, giving millions of Americans a chance to view the darkening face of the martyr. Hay and Nicolay traveled on their own to Springfield, arriving in time for one last memorial service in the Illinois State House. On May 4, the coffin was closed and the president was placed in a receiving vault in Oak Ridge Cemetery, awaiting the erection of a permanent monument to his greatness.<br> <br>Hay and Nicolay returned to Washington to finish crating the contents of Lincoln&#x2019;s office. By the end of the month, they were through and able to make more leisurely visits back to Illinois&#x2014;Nicolay to be married in Pittsfield, with Hay as his best man; and Hay to see his family in the Mississippi River town of Warsaw.<br> <br>Once more Hay returned to Washington, this time to receive his instructions for Paris. Throughout the war years, he had become accustomed to the capital&#x2019;s mood careening from one quarter of the emotional compass to another, depending on the latest news from the war&#x2019;s many fronts: military, civil, political, and diplomatic. Nevertheless, he was not ready for the scene that greeted him in Washington after an absence of only a few weeks.<br> <br>Andrew Johnson had begun his dubious tenure by setting up temporary shop in the Treasury Building until Mary Lincoln was ready to decamp, which she finally did on May 22, accompanied by some twenty trunks filled with a great many White House furnishings. When Hay paid a visit to the mansion in June, it felt at once haunted and unfamiliar. &#x201c;I found the shadow of recent experiences resting on everything,&#x201d; he wrote Robert Lincoln later. &#x201c;The White House was full of new faces, a swarm of orderlies at doors and windows&#x2014;the offices filled with new clerks, the anterooms crowded with hungry visitors. It was worse than a nightmare. I got away as soon as I could from the place. I think it will never be again anything less than the evil days in which we left it.&#x201d; He sailed for Europe on June 24, along with Nicolay and his bride.<br> <br>Over the next four decades, John Hay would cross the threshold of the White House hundreds more times, as a friend of presidents, as assistant secretary of state, as ambassador, and finally as secretary of state. But there would always be a before and an after: before the assassination and all that came next. Lincoln was the line of demarcation, by far the deepest tree ring, of Hay&#x2019;s sixty-six years of personal history and public service. He had lived with Lincoln; he had witnessed the infancy of the Republican Party; he had served and survived the republic&#x2019;s trial by fire; and while many of his contemporaries would proudly wave the bloody shirt of Republicanism into the next century, Hay bore the distinction of having been bathed, or nearly enough, in the Great Emancipator&#x2019;s actual blood, not to mention his intelligence, humor, and love.<br> <br>For the rest of America, Lincoln would represent a bundle of ideals: patience, perseverance, wisdom, humility, kindness, charity&#x2014;a full panoply of biblical virtues. To Hay, he was the sum of all these, &#x201c;the greatest man of his time.&#x201d; Yet to Hay, Lincoln was also corporeal. Hay knew firsthand how Lincoln ate his breakfast, sat a horse, cracked a joke. He had been with Lincoln at Gettysburg. On summer evenings he had rocked with him on the veranda of the Soldiers&#x2019; Home. Lincoln would wake Hay in the middle of the night and read aloud to him. When he finished, Hay recalled, &#x201c;the tall gaunt figure would rise from the edge of my bed and start for the door and on down the dark corridor. The candle carried high in his hand would light the disheveled hair as the President in flapping night-shirt, his feet padding along in carpet slippers, would disappear into the darkness.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lincoln had four sons: one died very young; Willie died in the White House at age eleven; Tad, though his father&#x2019;s pet, was unruly and learning-disabled. Robert was bright, but he and his father for some reason never hit it off. More than with anyone else in the immediate family, Lincoln had a rapport with John Hay. Neither of them ever acknowledged that Hay was the son Lincoln wished he&#x2019;d had, not in so many words. But by default, Hay became Lincoln&#x2019;s fair-haired boy. Lincoln sanctioned Hay (and Nicolay) to write his biography. Beyond that, he awarded Hay the most precious gift of his patrimony: the spark to forge ahead, first as writer, next as statesman, then both together.<br> <br>Lincoln did not give his young prot�g� a specific target so much as the sheer confidence to take aim and fire, and to make his life count for something. The underlying purpose was manifest, the same one Lincoln himself had striven to achieve as president and commander in chief&#x2014;namely, the protection, preservation, and prosperity of the Union.<br> <br>Hay was not nearly as single-minded as Lincoln; he was not a man of far-encompassing vision but more a man of successive vantage points, one guiding him toward the next, sometimes by leaps and bounds, at other times rather fitfully, but forward and upward always. He insisted humbly that the opportunities and accomplishments in his life were little more than a series of fortunate accidents, discounting what others recognized as his unfailing perspicacity and sound judgment. Whichever the case, he consistently did his best to repay Lincoln&#x2019;s largesse&#x2014;by championing Lincoln personally and by furthering the Republican cause in whatever ways he could. These loyalties in turn brought credit and glory to his own name.<br> <br>And no matter what, Lincoln was the example that Hay always came back to. Lincoln&#x2019;s standards were the standards against which he measured everyone in the world, starting with himself.<br> <br>HAY&#x2019;S RISE WAS RAPID and enviable. After Paris, he served in two more legations, Vienna and Madrid, returning to the United States a polished diplomat, conversant in four languages, precociously cosmopolitan in his manners and appetites. In New York he joined the staff of Horace Greeley&#x2019;s New York Tribune and quickly won respect as its most able editorialist. He never gave up poetry, and his verses brought him unexpected and extraordinary fame. He wrote a provocative and widely read novel, and with Nicolay he completed the ten-volume Abraham Lincoln: A History, which, at a million and a half words, was the heftiest historical exposition since Gibbon&#x2019;s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and a benchmark for all Lincoln books to follow.<br> <br>His marriage to Clara Stone, daughter of a Cleveland railroad, steel, and banking baron, ensured he would never again have to worry about money, and his appreciation for fine living bloomed accordingly. His manses on Cleveland&#x2019;s Millionaires&#x2019; Row and on Washington&#x2019;s Lafayette Square were filigreed to Gilded Age paragon. He built a summer retreat in New Hampshire, and he traveled lavishly in Europe, amassing a magnificent art collection and cultivating distinguished friends, especially in England, which he came to love nearly as much as his own country.<br> <br>All the while, he never let go of politics. In the years after Appomattox, he looked on with increasing chagrin and frustration as Lincoln&#x2019;s legacy was blasphemed by the chicanery of his party and the venalities of the Johnson and Grant White Houses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m keeper of the President&#x2019;s conscience,&#x201d; Hay had joked in 1861, shortly after first arriving in Washington. Going forward, he never shirked this responsibility. As the age of spoils and graft escalated, he came to be counted on not merely as a steadfast Lincoln man but as a trustworthy guide who helped lead the Grand Old Party back onto the path of righteousness. That he gave generously and regularly to the candidates he considered of the truest mettle further established him as one of the party&#x2019;s most influential lamplighters.<br> <br>He served briefly in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes but turned down the invitation of Hayes&#x2019;s successor, James Garfield, to stay on. Instead, he returned to New York to guest-edit the Tribune and wound up covering Garfield&#x2019;s assassination and long slide toward death with a sense of alarm that was as much personal as partisan.<br> <br>Nudged by Republican high priest Mark Hanna, whom, like Garfield, he had come to know in Cleveland, Hay pitched in to help rescue candidate (and fellow Ohioan) William McKinley from personal insolvency, thereby securing the one job he ever truly coveted, the ambassadorship to the Court of St. James&#x2019;s. President McKinley quickly recognized that Hay&#x2019;s extraordinary diplomatic aplomb could be put to higher use, and so, at the close of the Spanish-American War, McKinley brought him home to be secretary of state.

The people who roamed Early Earth were much like us: curious, emotional, funny, ambitious, and vulnerable. In this series of illustrated and linked tales, Isabel Greenberg chronicles the explorations of a young man as he paddles from his home in the North Pole to the South Pole. There, he meets his true love, but their romance is ill-fated. Early Earth's unusual and finicky polarity means the lovers can never touch. <br><br>As intricate and richly imagined as the work of Chris Ware, and leavened with a dry wit that rivals Kate Beaton's in <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>, Isabel Greenberg's debut will be a welcome addition to the thriving graphic novel genre.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2013: </strong>If <em>The Encyclopedia of Early Earth</em> is to be believed, the primitive days of our planet were icy landscapes drawn with thick, stark lines and highlighted with the careful use of bold colors. This beautiful comic, Isabel Greenberg's first, pulls on stories from cultural and religious traditions--Genesis, Nordic legends, Greek myths--as well as the work of other influential cartoonists--Kate Beaton, Seth, Jason--to create something unique and timeless. The stories here are imbued with such wit and heart: Two lovers--one from the North Pole, the other from the South--cannot come within two feet of each other because of their polar magnetization; an old woman defeats a giant with her storytelling; a cartographer is aided by three "genius monkeys from the Island of What." Greenberg uses our familiarity with archetypes to play with our expectations, bending these layered stories into something strange and delightful. <em>The Encyclopedia of Early Earth</em> is a journey that takes us from one end of the Earth to the other--just perhaps in the direction you'd least expect. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em>Isabel Greenberg is a writer and illustrator who lives and works in North London.

This was the Yogacara movement, and it continues to have great influence in modern Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. &#x201c;Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Trimshika,&#x201d; is the most concise, comprehensive, and accessible work by this revered figure.<br> <br> Vasubandhu&#x2019;s &#x201c;Thirty Verses&#x201d; lay out a path of practice that integrates the most powerful of Buddhism&#x2019;s psychological and mystical possibilities: Early Buddhism&#x2019;s practices for shedding afflictive emotional habit and the Mahayana emphasis on shedding divisive concepts, the path of individual liberation and the path of freeing all beings, the path to nirvana and the path of enlightenment as the very ground of being right now. Although Yogacara has a reputation for being extremely complex, the &#x201c;Thirty Verses&#x201d; distills the principles of these traditions to their most practical forms, and this book follows that sense of focus; it goes to the heart of the matter&#x2014;how do we alleviate suffering through shedding our emotional knots and our sense of alienation?<br> <br> This is a&nbsp;great introduction to a philosophy, a master, and a work whose influence reverberates throughout modern Buddhism.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Ben Connelly is a Soto Zen teacher and Dharma heir in the Katagiri lineage.

The life of Jabez, one of the Bible&#39;s most overlooked heroes of the faith, bursts from unbroken pages of genealogies in an audacious, four-part prayer that brings him an extraordinary measure of divine favor, anointing, and protection. Readers who commit to offering the same prayer on a regular basis will find themselves extravagantly blessed by God and agents of His miraculous power in everyday life.</p><p>Even well-versed Biblical scholars might be perplexed if asked about Jabez, a little-known man listed in 1 Chronicles, chapter 4. Yet his simple petition is the cornerstone of <i>The Prayer of Jabez</i> and has become a call to live a more "blessed life" for countless readers. <p> The prayer is a simple one: "And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, 'Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain.' So God granted him what he requested."</p><p> In an era where many Christians shy away from anything that smacks of "name it and claim it," author Bruce Wilkinson alleviates misgivings by putting the prayer into perspective. Wilkinson, founder and president of Walk thru the Bible Ministries and a popular speaker for Promise Keepers, writes in a persuasive, conversational style that will woo even the most cynical reader. He has used the Jabez prayer for more than 30 years, and testifies enthusiastically to the changes it has wrought in his own life. Wilkinson challenges readers to recite the Jabez prayer every morning and keep a record of the changes that occur. The power, he emphasizes, is not in the prayer itself, but "rather, the power is in what you believe will happen as a result of the prayer, and the action you take." Wilkinson makes a convincing case. --<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>Bruce Wilkinson is the founder of Walk Thru the Bible Ministries and Walk Thru the Bible International. He is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Prayer of Jabez and Secrets of the Vine as well as 30 Days to Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs and numerous other books.

James Skehan explains the geologic history behind the rocks and landforms visible from the state&#39;s highways, including such well-known historic features as Bloody Bluff, Beacon Hill, Plymouth Rock, and Walden Pond. Interspersed through the guidebook are tales of pioneering geologists such as Harvard&#39;s Louis Agassiz, the first to propose that continental glaciers--not the remnants of Noah&#39;s Flood as early settlers had imagined--polished the state&#39;s bedrock and deposited its enormous boulders and sand plains. Numerous maps and photographs reveal ancient volcanoes, marble potholes, colorful minerals, dinosaur footprints, and America&#39;s first commercial railroad--built with blocks of Quincy granite. Geologic roadguides include tours of Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, Cape Cod National Seashore, Nantucket, Martha&#39;s Vineyard, and Mount Greylock State Reservation.</p><p>Longtime teacher and researcher James W. Skehan is professor emeritus in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Boston College and director emeritus of Weston Observatory. The National Association of Geology Teachers named him Teacher of the Year in 1976. Skehan holds a doctorate in geology from Harvard University as well as a master&#39;s in theology from Weston College. As a Jesuit priest and geologist, he actively promotes dialogue between scientists and theologians. While studying Iceland&#39;s active geology in 1970, he officiated the first mass ever celebrated on Surtsey Volcano, a newly formed island in the North Atlantic. Skehan fell irrevocably in love with field geology in 1946 on a trip through the red rocks, lavas, and glacial lake clays of the Connecticut Valley. Since then he has searched on several continents for clues as to how and when the mountains and ocean basins around the Atlantic evolved. When tectonic plates were identified in the 1960s, he came to understand that present-day continents were pieced together by the assembly and breakup successively of three supercontinents. Skehan leads excursions to fascinating localities where group members can visualize the formation, movement, and melting of the Concord Glacier 14,000 years ago.&#34;Skehan&#39;s language is down to earth . . . making the intricacies of earth science accessible to all readers.

Three brothers weep at their father's fatal illness until an old man tells them of a magic cure, the Water of Life. Each in turn sets out to find the cure, but because the older two have unpure motives and are mean-spirited, they do not succeed. The youngest son, through kindness and perseverance, attains the magic fluid and the love of a princess who promises to wait a year for his return. Tricked by the older brothers who substitute bitter sea water in his goblet and present the Water of Life to their father as their own achievement, the youngest brother is banished. At the end of the year, the false brothers try to win the princess, but the youngest once again wins the prize through strength of character and purity of motive. This traditional tale with all the trappings of magical elements, romance, and underlying psychological truth, is brought to life by Rogasky's spirited telling and Hyman's lush illustrations. The richly detailed paintings bring the landscape of the folk tale vividly to life, from the sick king's dark bed chamber hung with tapestries and dimly lit by stained glass windows, to the lightness and cheer of the wedding celebration at the end. Particularly noteworthy is the artist's use of color and light to vary the mood. An exquisite blend of text and illustrations, this rendition will be appealing to older children as well as those in primary grades. Connie C. Rockman, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, Conn.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Based on a Grimm fairy tale, Rogasky's elegant text portrays the age-old battle between Goodness and Evil. Three sons seek the Water of Life, which will cure the illness of their father, the king, but only the youngest is pure enough of heart to find it. Before the story's end, he is tested by a good dwarf, falls in love with a princess in an enchanted castle, tames two lions, saves the kingdoms of three kings, survives the treachery of his brothers and finally finds happiness. As usual, Caldecott medalist Hyman has created stunning illustrations that are inventive and richly detailed: black rooks silhouetted by firelight, medieval tapestries in the king's bedchamber, enchanted beasts, and more. This is a simply beautiful book. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spanish/English Parallel New Testament Psalms/Proverbs</h2><p><p>New International Version Bilingual New Testament With Psalms and Proverbs (Spanish/English). Never before has there been a bilingual New Testament of such high quality in modern English and Spanish. The New International Version (NIV) has become the most popular contemporary English version in recent years largely because of its accuracy and clarity. Its Spanish counterpart, the Nueva Version Internacional (NVI), has taken advantage of the scholarship and principles that have made the NIV so successful. However, careful attention has been given to preserve the quality and richness of the Spanish language, while remaining faithful to the original language of the Scriptures. Due to its harmony in principles and purposes, this parallel edition of the English NIV and Spanish NVI is the best of its kind available. It is highly recommended for those seeking to learn Spanish or English, as well as those who already have a grasp of both languages and want to compare them in their reading of God's Word.</p></p><p></p><h2>Simply in Season Expanded Edition (World Community Cookbook)</h2><p>This new, expanded edition of Simply in Season features new recipes that use locally grown and fairly traded seasonal foods.

At the age of thirty-four, after a failed marriage, single motherhood, and a stint on welfare, she graduated summa cum laude from Mankato State University and has a masters degree from Emporia State University. She worked at the Spencer Public Library for twenty-five years, the last twenty as director. She lives in Spencer, Iowa.<b><p>Prologue </p></b><p><i>Dewey </i></p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Vicki, and thank you, Dewey. . . . I don&#x2019;t believe in angels, but Dewey comes close.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Christine B., Tampa, FL </p><p>I disagree with the person who wrote that letter, because I do believe there are angels walking among us, helping us grow. I believe in &#x201c;teachable moments,&#x201d; when we can learn something valuable about life if our eyes and hearts are open to the world around us. These angels of opportunity, as I like to think of them, come in all forms. They appear thanks to the important people in our lives, but also through chance meetings and strangers. I believe Dewey Readmore Books, the famous library cat of Spencer, Iowa, was one of those angels. He taught so many lessons, and touched so many lives, that I can&#x2019;t dismiss it as chance. And I don&#x2019;t believe in coincidence. </p><p>But I know what that young woman is saying. She is saying that Dewey, through his actions and his example, transformed her life. She can&#x2019;t find the words to describe that power, but she knows it is special. </p><p>Well, I have a phrase for it: Dewey&#x2019;s Magic. It is the phrase I used each time I saw his ability to change the way people thought about themselves. No one saw that Magic more than I, because of all the people in the world, I knew Dewey best and was touched by him most. I&#x2019;m just an ordinary Iowa girl, the long-serving director of a small-town library less than a dozen miles from the farm where I was born and raised, but for nineteen years I was privileged to share my journey with Dewey. And Dewey . . . he was special. He impacted lives. He inspired a town. He became famous around the world, headlined magazines and newspapers, and was the subject of the #1 New York Times bestselling memoir Dewey, which as &#x201c;Dewey&#x2019;s Mommy&#x201d; I was privileged to write. Dewey&#x2019;s Magic, that&#x2019;s what it was. He was just a cat, but he had a way of inspiring our better selves. He made everyone fall in love with him. He touched the world. No one who met him ever forgot Dewey Readmore Books. </p><p>His story began quietly, on a brutally cold weekend in January 1988. The temperature was minus fifteen degrees, the kind of cold that burns your lungs and peels the skin from your face (or at least it feels that way). That kind of cold, often accompanied by ferocious winds, is the worst thing about living in the great northern plains. </p><p>You learn to tolerate it, but you never adapt. There are times in northern Iowa when it just isn&#x2019;t wise to go outside. </p><p>But despite the deep freeze, someone had been out in downtown Spencer, because at some point that Sunday, a tiny homeless kitten was shoved into the book return slot on the back wall of the Spencer Public Library. I hope it was an act of mercy, that someone saw a tiny eight-week-old, one-pound kitten shivering in the snow and wanted to protect it. If that was the case, they were misguided. The library book return was nothing more than a metal tube that led, after a four-foot drop, into a sealed metal box. In effect, it was a refrigerator. There were no blankets, pads, or soft linings. There was only cold metal. And books. For at least ten hours and maybe as long as twenty-four, little Dewey sat in bitterly cold utter darkness, with nothing to comfort him but books. </p><p>I entered the story early Monday morning when I opened the book return box and found the tiny kitten inside. When he looked up longingly into my eyes, my heart stopped. He was so cute . . . and so in need. I cradled him in my hands until he stopped shivering, then gave him a warm bath in the library sink and dried him with the blow-dryer we used for children&#x2019;s craft projects. That&#x2019;s when Dewey took over, tottering on frostbitten feet to each person on the library staff and nuzzling them sweetly with his nose. </p><p>I decided, right then, that the library should adopt him. It wasn&#x2019;t just that I fell in love with Dewey the moment he looked at me with his glorious golden eyes. I knew, for those eyes and his determination to thank every staff member for his rescue, that he would fit perfectly into my plan to warm up the cold institutional nature of the Spencer Public Library. He had such a loving and outgoing personality, such a heartwarming presence, that he made everyone feel good. </p><p>And at that moment, that&#x2019;s exactly what Spencer, Iowa, needed. The town was reeling from a farm crisis, with 70 percent of the downtown storefronts empty and farms in the county going bankrupt by the dozen. We needed a feel-good story. We needed something positive to talk about, and a lesson in persistence, hope, and love. If someone could shove a tiny kitten into a dark and freezing metal box, and that kitten could emerge with his trust and compassion intact, then we could endure our misfortunes, too. </p><p>But Dewey wasn&#x2019;t a mascot. He was a flesh-and-blood companion, an animal always open and loving the moment anyone stepped into the library. He warmed hearts one lap at a time, and maybe even more important, he had a knack for knowing who really needed him. </p><p>I remember the retired patrons who visited every morning. Many of them started staying longer and talking with the staff more after Dewey arrived. </p><p>I remember Crystal, a middle school student with severe physical disabilities who did nothing but stare at the floor until Dewey found her and started jumping onto her wheelchair as she was rolled through the door. Then Crystal started to look at the world around her. She started to make noises every week when she entered the library, and when Dewey came running and leapt on her chair, a smile burst out of her heart. </p><p>I remember our new assistant children&#x2019;s librarian, who had recently moved to Spencer to care for her sick mother. She and Dewey sat together every afternoon. I caught her one day with a tear in her eye and realized how much she had been suffering, and that only Dewey had been there for her. </p><p>I remember the shy woman who had trouble making friends. I remember the young man frustrated by his inability to find work. I remember the homeless man who never spoke to anyone but always found Dewey, placed him on his shoulder (the right shoulder of course; Dewey would sit only on your right shoulder), and walked with him for fifteen minutes. The man whispered; Dewey listened. I am convinced of that. And by listening, by being present, he helped them all. </p><p>But mostly, I remember the children. Dewey had a special relationship with the children of Spencer. He loved babies. He would creep to their carriers and snuggle beside them, a look of complete contentment on his face, even when they pulled his ears. He let toddlers pet him and prod him and squeal with delight. He befriended a boy with allergies who was heartbroken because he couldn&#x2019;t have a pet of his own. He spent afternoons with the middle school students who stayed in the library while their parents worked, chasing their pencils and hiding in their jacket sleeves. He would brush by every child at our weekly Story Hour before choosing one lap to curl up on&#x2014;a different lap, I should mention, every week. Yes, Dewey had catlike habits. He slept a lot. He was picky about being petted on the belly. He ate rubber bands. He attacked typewriter keys (back then, we still had typewriters around) and computer keyboards. He lounged on the copier, because it blew warm air. He climbed on the overhead lights. You couldn&#x2019;t open a box anywhere in the library without Dewey suddenly appearing and jumping inside. But what he really did was something just as catlike but more profound: He opened the hearts of the people of Spencer, one at a time, to the beauty and love in our wonderful little town in the middle of the great Iowa plains, and to one another. </p><p>That was the real Dewey Magic, his ability to spread his joyous, friendly, and relaxed attitude toward life to everyone he met. </p><p>The fact that he became famous? That was pure charisma. I intended, of course, for him to become well known in Spencer. I worked hard to help him change the image of the library, to make it a gathering place as opposed to just a warehouse for books. I was amazed that anyone outside northwest Iowa would care. But slowly at first, and then in a torrent, they came, drawn by the story of the special cat who inspired a town. The journalists came first&#x2014;from Des Moines, England, Boston, and Japan. Then the visitors started to arrive. An older couple from New York on a cross-country drive who, after visiting Dewey, sent money on his birthday and Christmas every year of his life. A family from Rhode Island, who were in Minneapolis (five hours away from Spencer) for a wedding. A sick little girl from Texas who, I was sure, had asked her parents for this one gift. It was amazing to watch the accidental blossoming of fame. People met Dewey; they spent time with him; and they loved him. They went home and told other people about him, and then those people came to visit him, and they left impressed, and the next thing we knew, we were receiving a telephone call from a newspaper in Los Angeles or a news reporter in Australia. </p><p>So when Dewey died peacefully at the age of nineteen, having served the community of Spencer and its public library every day with enthusiasm and grace, I wasn&#x2019;t really surprised that his obituary, first published in Sioux City, ran in more than 275 newspapers. Or that the library received letters by the thousands from around the world. Or that hundreds of fans signed his condolence book and attended an impromptu memorial. For two months, we were besieged by reporters and admirers and requests to talk about Dewey. And then, slowly, the clamor died down. The cameras turned off, and Spencer went back to being the quiet little town it had always been. Those of us who had loved Dewey were, finally, left to our personal grief. Dewey the celebrity was gone; the memories of Dewey our friend remained, held privately in our hearts. When I finally buried Dewey&#x2019;s ashes outside the window of the children&#x2019;s section of the library he had loved so much, it was at dawn on a freezing December morning with only the assistant library director at my side. And that&#x2019;s the way he would have wanted it. </p><p>I knew he had left a legacy, because Dewey had changed me. He had changed members of the library staff. He had changed Crystal the disabled girl, and the homeless man, and the children who came each week for Story Hour, many of whom brought their own children to see him in his later years. I knew how important he was because people kept telling me their Dewey stories, confiding in me in a way. In the end, he touched more than the town of Spencer. But it was those of us who had known him and loved him and heard his story that he changed. His legacy would live on in us. </p><p>I thought that was it. I really did. </p><p>And then something amazing happened. I wrote a book about Dewey, and people around the world responded. The book was meant as a tribute to my friend, a thank-you for his service to Spencer and his impact on my life. I knew he had fans. I thought they might want to read the full story. I was not prepared for the passionate response. So many of the people who attended my book events didn&#x2019;t just like Dewey, and didn&#x2019;t just enjoy the book. They loved them both. They felt touched by the story. And they felt changed. I remember one woman in Sioux City who broke down in tears as she told me that her mother, a Spencer piano teacher and church organist, had taken her every Saturday for cinnamon rolls and a trip to the library to see Dewey. Then her mother developed Alzheimer&#x2019;s and slowly forgot her husband, her children, even her own identity. Her daughter drove two hours from Sioux City to visit her every week, and she always brought her own cat with her. The cat was black and white, nothing like copper-colored Dewey at all, but every week her mother smiled and said, &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s Dewey. Thank you for bringing Dewey.&#x201d; The daughter could barely get those last words out, she was crying so hard. </p><p>&#x201c;I went out in the parking lot after I met you,&#x201d; she told me some time later, &#x201c;and sat in my car and cried for fifteen minutes. The tears wouldn&#x2019;t stop. My mother had been dead for twelve years, but it was the first time I had really cried for her. Thinking about Dewey, remembering how much my mother loved him, was the end of the grieving process.&#x201d; </p><p>The strangest thing? I didn&#x2019;t know this woman, Margo Chesebro, or her mother, Grace Barlow-Chesebro (although from her daughter&#x2019;s description of a smart, strong, independent woman who believed in the magic of animals, I&#x2019;m sure I would have liked her). And yet, they had known and loved Dewey. He had been a regular and important part of their lives, important enough that Grace would somehow retain his memory in her damaged mind, even as she lost forever the names of her children and became convinced her husband was her long-dead brother. There was no way, I realized then, that I could ever truly know the extent of the lives Dewey had touched. </p><p>And then there were the people who had never known Dewey, the strangers who were so touched by his story, they felt compelled to write to me. It started almost immediately after the book&#x2019;s publication. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never written to an author before but I was so moved by Dewey&#x2019;s story. . . .&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Dewey was an angel, thank you for sharing him with the world.&#x201d; </p><p>As the months went on, and the book topped the national best-seller lists, the letters became more frequent, until I was receiving dozens every day. After a year, I had received more than three thousand letters, e-mails, and packages, almost all from people who had never heard of Dewey before reading the book. I received a pillow cross-stitched with the image of Dewey from the book&#x2019;s cover. I received several paintings of him. A former resident of Spencer, who had moved away but had never forgotten, commissioned a sculpture of Dewey for the library. (I knew Dewey&#x2019;s Magic was at work when I saw where the artist&#x2019;s studio was located: Dewey, Arizona.) I can&#x2019;t even count how many drawings, ornaments, and carvings of cats I have received from fans. I have a bookcase in my house just to display them&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s overflowing. </p><p>One person sent me twenty dollars to buy roses for Dewey. Another sent five dollars to place catnip on his grave. A woman at a call center in Idaho told me that every time someone calls from Iowa, she asks about Dewey, hoping to find someone who knew him. Another man sent a picture of the jar in which he collects spare change. It featured a picture of Dewey. The man was donating his change, from that time forward, to animal rescue. </p><p>I read every card, letter, and e-mail. I wanted to respond, but there was no way to keep up with the volume, especially since I was often on the road, meeting Dewey&#x2019;s fans. (But please rest assured, letter writers, that I bought those roses and that catnip for Dewey&#x2019;s grave.) The sentiments expressed in the letters, and the way Dewey continued to change people&#x2019;s lives, touched me more, I suspect, than these fans ever imagined. </p><p>A young man who had suffered a devastating divorce and career setback that left him bitter and angry wrote to say that Dewey&#x2019;s life &#x201c;opened my heart.&#x201d; </p><p>A woman with severe MS told me how, after reading Dewey, she got down on the floor to kiss the head of the dog that lived in her group home. Afterward, she was u...</p></p><h2>Battles at Thrush Green</h2><p>Feelings are running high in the Cotswold village of Thrush Green.

Did Supreme Court sell out America's citizens in the nineteenth century, with consequences lasting to this day? Is there a way for American citizens to recover democracy of, by, and for the people?<br><br>Thom Hartmann takes on these most difficult questions and tells a startling story that will forever change your understanding of American history. He begins by uncovering an original eyewitness account of the Boston Tea Party and demonstrates that it was provoked not by "taxation without representation" as is commonly suggested but by the specific actions of the East India Company, which represented the commericial interests of the British elite.<br><br>Hartmann then describes the history of the Fourteenth Amendment--created at the end of the Civil War to grant basic rights to freed slaves--and how it has been used by lawyers representing corporate interests to extend additional rights to businesses far more frequently than to freed slaves. Prior to 1886, corporations were referred to in U.S. law as "artificial persons." but in 1886, after a series of cases brought by lawyers representing the expanding railroad interests, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations were "persons" and entitled to the same rights granted to people under the Bill of Rights. Since this ruling, America has lost the legal structures that allowed for people to control corporate behavior.<br><br>As a result, the largest transnational corporations fill a role today that has historically been filled by kings. They control most of the world's wealth and exert power over the lives of most of the world's citizens. Their CEOs are unapproachable and live lives of nearly unimaginable wealth and luxury. They've become the rudder that steers the ship of much human experience, and they're steering it by their prime value--growth and profit and any expense--a value that has become destructive for life on Earth. This new feudalism was not what our Founders--Federalists and Democratic Republicans alike--envisioned for America.<br><br>It's time for "we, the people" to take back our lives. Hartmann proposes specific legal remedies that could truly save the world from political, economic, and ecological disaster.</p><p>"If you wonder why the corporate world constantly lurches from malaise to oppression to governmental corruption and back, Unequal Protection reveals the untold story. Beneath the success and rise of American enterprise is an untold history that is antithetical to every value Americans hold dear. This is a seminal work, a godsend really, a clear message to every citizen about the need to reform our country, laws, and companies." <br>--Paul Hawken, author, Natural Capitalism<p> "I am grateful for this gift. It should be in the hands of every thinking American. If we do not awaken soon, democracy will be replaced by a new 'Third Reich' of corporate tyranny. To be aware of the danger is the responsibility of each of us. No one has told us the truth better than Thom Hartmann. Read it!" <br>--Gerry Spence, author, Give Me Liberty!</p><p> "This extraordinary book combines meticulous historical and legal research with a clear and compelling writing style to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt the incompatibility of corporate personhood with democracy, the market economy, and the well-being of society. Complete with a practical program for essential reform to restore the rights of real persons - including model legislation - it is essential reading and an invaluable reference work for every citizen who cares about democracy, justice, and the human future." <br>--David C. Korten, author, When Corporations Rule The World</p><p> "Unequal Protection is a blueprint for revitalizing the spirit of American democracy. Sometimes you have to understand the bad news in order to appreciate the good news. Thom Hartmann connects the dots in a way that is a tremendous gift for our generation of Americans." <br>--Marianne Williamson, author, Healing the Soul of America</p><p> "Essential reading for anyone concerned about the future of democracy, both here and abroad. With devastating precision and well-reasoned passion, Thom Hartmann shows the reader precisely how the corporate entity gained such a perilously dominant role in the life of a nation whose founders meant for its politics to respond to the concerns of people and communities, not return-seeking corporations." <br>--Jeff Gates, president, Shared Capitalism Institute, author, Democracy At Risk</p><p> "We thought it was only in science fiction that things created by humans could actually take over what is inherently our human heritage. But Thom Hartmann shows how we've already let that happen on a frightening scale - not in Frankenstein's monsters or Kubrick's creeping computer Hal - but in the corporations that present their friendly 'faces' to us as if we have nothing to fear from this ultimate usurpation of our rights as real humans." <br>--Ed Ayres, Senior Editor at Worldwatch and author, God's Last Offer</p><p> "For years, Thom Hartmann has been asking the important questions and inspiring people to act on their solutions. Now he tackles one of the hardest - how democracy in America and worldwide has been eroded by unaccountable corporate power. He looks at the structures that encourage destructive behaviour and offers alternatives. Fascinating history told engagingly. We need books like this to find a way forward." <br>--Paul Loeb, author, Soul of a Citizen</p><p> "Hartmann goes where no person has gone before - towards uncovering the true history of how corporations and the wealthy people behind them transformed our law and culture to usurp democracy. This book is an inspiration to all groups and communitites and explains why we must rethink our engagement in single issue struggles and move towards the assertion of direct, democratic control over corporations." <br>--Thomas Linzey, Esq., Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund</p><p> "Many consider Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address to be the penultimate statement of our nation's spiritual mission. It's climactic words resolve that 'government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.' But we are today allowing a rise of corporate dominance that is producing a 'government of the corporation, by the corporation, and for the corporation.' Our government has lost track of its mandate to serve the public interest and seems increasingly to do the bidding of corporate interests. The consequences - for human rights, social justice, public health, and the environment - are catastrophic. How has this come to pass? And most critically, is there anything we can do about it? Unequal Protection is nothing less than an act of compelling and heroic sanity. It is THE book to read if you want to perceive corporate dominance clearly, become more able to stand in its way, and more able to uphold the true values of this nation." <br>--John Robbins, author The Food Revolution, and Diet For A New America</p><p></p><b>"Beneath the success</b> and rise of American enterprise is an untold history that is antithetical to every value Americans hold dear.

He lives in Toronto, Canada.Chapter 1&nbsp;<br>In the summer of his twelfth year&#x2014;the summer the stars began to fall from the sky&#x2014;the boy Isaac discovered that he could tell east from west with his eyes closed.<br>Isaac lived at the edge of the Great Inland Desert, on the continent of Equatoria, on the planet that had been appended to the Earth by the inscrutable beings called the Hypotheticals. People had given the planet a whole panoply of grandiose or mythological or coolly scientific names, but most simply called it the New World, in any of a hundred or more languages, or Equatoria, after its most widely settled continent. These were things Isaac had learned in what passed for school.<br>He lived in a compound of brick and adobe, far from the nearest town. He was the only child at the settlement. The adults with whom he lived preferred to keep a careful distance between themselves and the rest of the world. They were special, in ways they were reluctant to discuss. Isaac, too, was special. They had told him so, many times. But he wasn&#x2019;t sure he believed them. He didn&#x2019;t feel special. Often he felt much less than special.<br>Occasionally the adults, especially Dr. Dvali or Mrs. Rebka, asked Isaac whether he was lonely. He wasn&#x2019;t. He had books, he had the video library to fill his time. He was a student, and he learned at his own pace&#x2014;steadily if not quickly. In this, Isaac suspected, he was a disappointment to his keepers. But the books and videos and lessons filled his time, and when they were unavailable there was the natural world around him, which had become a kind of mute, indifferent friend: the mountains, gray and green and brown, sloping down to this arid plain, the edge of the desert hinterland, a curdled landscape of rock and sand. Few things grew here, since the rain came only in the first months of spring and sparsely even then. In the dry washes there were lumpish plants with prosaic names: barrel cucumbers, leather vines. In the courtyard of the compound a native garden had been planted, cactus feathery with purple flowers, tall nevergreens with weblike blossoms that extracted moisture from the air. Sometimes a man named Raj irrigated the garden from a pump that ran deep into the earth, and on those mornings the air smelled of mineral-rich water: a steely scent that carried for kilometers. On watering day, rock shrews would burrow under the fence and tumble comically across the tiled courtyard.<br>Isaac&#x2019;s days passed in gentle sameness early in the summer of his twelfth year, as his days had always passed, but that sleepy peace came to an end the day the old woman arrived.<br>���<br>She came, remarkably, on foot.<br>Isaac had left the compound that afternoon and climbed a small distance up the foothills, to a granite shelf that jutted from the slope of a ridge like a ship&#x2019;s prow from a pebbly sea. The afternoon sun had warmed the rock to a fine, fierce heat. Isaac, with his wide-brimmed hat and white cotton shirt to protect him from the burning light, sat under the lip of the ridge where there was still shade, watching the horizon. The desert rippled in rising waves of furnace air. He was alone and motionless&#x2014;afloat in heat, a castaway on a sere raft of stone&#x2014;when the woman appeared. At first she was just a dot down the unpaved road that led from the distant towns where Isaac&#x2019;s keepers went to buy food and supplies. She moved slowly, or seemed to. Nearly an hour passed before he could identify her as a woman&#x2014;then an old woman&#x2014;then an old woman with a pack on her back, a bow-legged posture, and a dogged, determined stride. She wore a white robe and a white sun hat.<br>The road passed close to this rock, almost directly beneath it, and Isaac, who didn&#x2019;t want to be seen, though he could not say why, scooted behind a boulder and crouched there as she approached. He closed his eyes and imagined he felt the bulk and weight of the land beneath him, the old woman&#x2019;s two feet tickling the skin of the desert like a beetle on the body of a slumbering giant. (And he felt another presence, deep in that earth, a quiescent behemoth stirring in its long sleep far to the west. . . . )<br>The old woman paused beneath the shelf of rock as if she could see him in his hiding place. Isaac was aware of the break in the rhythm of her shuffling steps. Or maybe she had innocently paused to sip water from a canteen. She said nothing. Isaac held himself very still, something he was good at.<br>Then her steps resumed. She walked on, leaving the road where a trail bent toward the compound. Isaac lifted his head and looked after her. She was many meters away now, the long light of the afternoon drawing her shadow alongside her like a leggy caricature. As soon as he saw her she paused and turned back, and for a moment it seemed as if their eyes met, and Isaac hastily ducked away, uncertain whether he had been seen. He was startled by the accuracy of her gaze and he remained hidden for a long time, until the sunlight angled deep into the mountain passes. He hid even from himself, quiet as a fish in a pool of memory and thought.<br>The old woman reached the compound&#x2019;s gates and went inside and stayed there. Before the sky grew wholly dark, Isaac followed her. He wondered if he would be introduced to the woman, perhaps at dinner.<br>Very few outsiders came to the compound. Of those who came, most came to stay.<br>���<br>After Isaac had bathed and put on clean clothes he went to the dining room.<br>This was where the entire community, all thirty of the adults, gathered every evening. Morning and afternoon meals were impromptu, could be taken at any time as long as you were willing to do your own work in the kitchen, but dinner was a collective effort, always crowded, inevitably noisy.<br>Usually Isaac enjoyed hearing the adults talk among themselves, though he seldom understood what they said unless it was trivial: whose turn it was to go to town for provisions, how a roof might be repaired or a well improved. More often, since the adults were mainly scientists and theoreticians, their talk turned to abstract matters. Listening, Isaac had retained few of the details of their work but something of its general content. There was always talk of time and stars and the Hypotheticals, of technology and biology, of evolution and transformation. Although these conversations usually pivoted on words he couldn&#x2019;t understand, they had a fine and lofty sound about them. The debates&#x2014;were the Hypotheticals properly called beings, conscious entities, or were they some vast and mindless process?&#x2014;often grew heated, philosophies defended and attacked like military objectives. It was as if in some nearby but inaccessible room the universe itself was being taken apart and reassembled.<br>Tonight the murmur was subdued. There was a newcomer present: the old woman from the road. Isaac, bashfully taking a seat between Dr. Dvali and Mrs. Rebka, cast furtive glances at her. She did not return them; in fact she seemed indifferent to his presence at the table. When the opportunity arose, Isaac studied her face.<br>She was even older than he had guessed. Her skin was dark and skeined with wrinkles. Her eyes, bright and liquid, peered out from skully chambers. She held her knife and fork in long, fragile fingers. Her palms were pale. She had changed out of her desert garb into clothing more like what the other adults wore: jeans and a pale yellow cotton shirt. Her hair was thin and cut close to the scalp. She wore no rings or necklaces. In the crook of one elbow was a patch of cotton held down with surgical tape: Mrs. Rebka, the community physician, must already have taken a blood sample from her. But that happened to every newcomer. Isaac wondered if Mrs. Rebka had had a hard time finding a vein in that small sinewy arm. He wondered what the blood test had been meant to detect, and whether Mrs. Rebka had found what she was looking for.<br>No special attention was paid to the newcomer at dinner. She joined in conversation but the talk remained superficial, as if no one wanted to give away any secrets before the stranger was fully approved, absorbed, understood. It was not until the dishes had been cleared and several pots of coffee placed on the long table that Dr. Dvali introduced Isaac to her.<br>&#x201c;Isaac,&#x201d; he began, and the boy gazed at the tabletop uncomfortably, &#x201c;this is Sulean Moi&#x2014;she&#x2019;s come a long way to meet you.&#x201d;<br>A long way? What did that mean? And&#x2014;to meet him?<br>&#x201c;Hello, Isaac,&#x201d; the newcomer said. Her voice was not the harsh croak he had expected. In fact her voice was mellifluous despite a certain grit . . . and, in some way he could not pin down, familiar.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; he said, still avoiding her eyes.<br>&#x201c;Please call me Sulean,&#x201d; she said.<br>He nodded cautiously.<br>&#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;ll be friends,&#x201d; she said.<br>���<br>He did not, of course, tell her immediately about his newfound ability to distinguish the points of the compass with his eyes closed. He hadn&#x2019;t told anyone about that, not even stern Dr. Dvali or the more sympathetic Mrs. Rebka. He was afraid of the scrutiny it would bring.<br>Sulean Moi, who moved into the compound, made a point of visiting him every morning after classes and before lunch. At first Isaac dreaded these visits. He was shy and not a little frightened of Sulean&#x2019;s great age and apparent frailty. But she was steadily, courteously friendly. She respected his silences, and the questions she asked were seldom awkward or intrusive.<br>&#x201c;Do you like your room?&#x201d; she asked one day.<br>Because he preferred to be alone he had been given this room to himself, a small but uncluttered chamber on the second story of the easternmost wing of the largest house. There was a window overlooking the desert, and Isaac had put his desk and chair in front of that window, his bed against the farther wall. He liked to keep the shutters open at night, to let the dry wind touch the bedsheets, his skin. He liked the smell of the desert.<br>&#x201c;I grew up in a desert,&#x201d; Sulean told him. A slant of sunlight through the window illuminated her left side, one arm and the parchment of her cheek and ear. Her voice was almost a whisper.<br>&#x201c;This desert?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, not this one. But one not very different.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why did you leave?&#x201d;<br>She smiled. &#x201c;I had places to go. Or at least I thought I did.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And this is where you came?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ultimately. Yes.&#x201d;<br>Because he liked her, and because he could not help being aware of what was unspoken between them, Isaac said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything to give you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect anything,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;The others do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do they?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dr. Dvali and the rest. They used to ask me a lot of questions&#x2014;how I felt, and what ideas I had, and what things in books meant. But they didn&#x2019;t like my answers.&#x201d; Eventually they had stopped asking, just as they had stopped giving him blood tests, psychological tests, perception tests.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m perfectly satisfied with you the way you are,&#x201d; the old woman said.<br>He wanted to believe her. But she was new, she had walked through the desert with the nonchalance of an insect on a sunny rock, her purposes were vague, and Isaac was still reluctant to share his most troublesome secrets.<br>���<br>All the adults were his teachers, though some were more patient or attentive than others. Mrs. Rebka taught him basic biology, Ms. Fischer taught him the geography of Earth and the New World, Mr. Nowotny told him about the sky and the stars and the relationship of suns and planets. Dr. Dvali taught him physics: inclined planes, the inverse square, electromagnetism. Isaac remembered his astonishment the first time he saw a magnet lift a spoon from a tabletop. An entire planet pulling downward, and what was this bit of stone in its power to reverse that universal flow? He had only begun to make sense of Dr. Dvali&#x2019;s answers.<br>Last year Dr. Dvali had shown him a compass. The planet, too, was a magnet, Dr. Dvali said. It had a rotating iron core, hence lines of force, a shield against charged particles arriving from the sun, a polarity that distinguished north from south. Isaac had asked to borrow the compass, a hefty military model made on Earth, and Dr. Dvali had generously allowed him to keep it.<br>Late in the evening, alone in his room, Isaac placed the compass on his desk so that the red point of the needle aligned with the letter N. Then he closed his eyes and spun himself around, stopped and waited for his dizziness to subside. Eyes still closed, he felt what the world told him, intuited his place in it, found the direction that eased some inner tension. Then he put out his right hand and opened his eyes to see which way he was pointing. He found out a lot of things, mostly irrelevant.<br>He performed the experiment on three successive nights. Each night he discovered himself aligned almost perfectly with the W on the face of the compass.<br>Then he did it again. And again. And again.<br>���<br>It was shortly before the annual meteor shower that he resolved at last to share this unsettling discovery with Sulean Moi.<br>The meteor shower came at the end of every August&#x2014;this year, on the 34th. (Months in the New World were named after terrestrial months, though each one lasted a few days longer than its namesake.) On the eastern coast of Equatoria, August signaled the beginning of the end of the mild summer: boats left the rich northern fisheries with their last harvests in order to arrive back at Port Magellan before the autumn storms began. Here in the desert it signified little more than the steady, subtle cooling of the nights. Desert seasons were nocturnal, it seemed to Isaac: the days were mostly alike, but winter nights could be bitingly, painfully cold.<br>Slowly Isaac had allowed Sulean Moi to become his friend. It wasn&#x2019;t that they talked much or about anything especially important. Sulean seemed almost as wordless as Isaac often was. But she accompanied him on his walks through the hills, and she was more agile than seemed possible for her age: she was slow, but she could climb as well as Isaac, and she could sit motionless for an hour or more when Isaac did. She never gave him the impression that this was a duty or a strategy or anything more or less than her way of sharing certain pleasures he had always suspected were his alone.<br>Sulean must not have seen the annual meteor shower before, since she told Isaac she had arrived in Equatoria only months ago. Isaac was a fan of the event and declared that she ought to see it from a good vantage point. So&#x2014;with the uneasy permission of Dr. Dvali, who didn&#x2019;t seem to entirely approve of Sulean Moi&#x2014;on the evening of the 34th he escorted her to the flat rock in the hills, the rock from which he had first seen her appear on the sun-quivering horizon.<br>That had been daylight, but now it was dark. The New World&#x2019;s moon was smaller and faster than Earth&#x2019;s, and it had traversed the sky completely by the time Sulean and Isaac arrived at their destination. Both carried hand lanterns to light their way, and both wore high boots and thick leggings to protect them from the sandfish that often basked on these granite ledges while the stone was still breathing out the heat of the day. Isaac scanned the location carefully and found no wildlife present. He sat crosslegged on the stone. Sulean bent slowly but without complaint into the same...</p><h2>The Other Wind</h2><p>Haunted by terrifying dreams of the land of death and of the dead who seek to invade Earthsea through him, the sorcerer Alder enlists the aid of Ged, a former Archmage, who advises him and his companions to find the holiest place in the world, the Immanent Grove on Roke, which holds the key to preserving Earthsea.

E. MODESITT, JR. is the bestselling author of over sixty novels encompassing two science fiction series and three fantasy series, including the saga of Recluce. He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>In the early summer afternoon, Quaeryt paced back and forth across the narrow stone stoop outside the main entrance to the hold house at Nordruil, occasionally blotting the sweat off his forehead, and glancing up at the worn and graying limestone walls and the single square tower that was likely centuries old. The grounds had received indifferent care, and it was clear that the hold house had been cleaned quickly and received new linens just before he had arrived, along with a few rankers and others to assist the hold staff. <br> <i>Just for Vaelora and me?</i> That was only one of the things that worried Quaeryt about what Bhayar had in mind. <br>Quaeryt had been waiting for Vaelora for well over a week. He had mostly recovered from the efforts that had changed the battle over Ferravyl from what would have likely been a bloody standoff into an overwhelming victory for Lord Bhayar and Telaryn&#x2014;but at the uncounted cost of revealing to Bhayar the scope of his imaging abilities&nbsp;&#x2026; and the other cost he had not even imagined. He shook his head, not wanting to think about it, or about the icy dreams, along with the bruises and strained muscles, that had kept him from sleeping on several nights. <br>Before all that long, he&#x2019;d be recalled to duty on the forthcoming campaign into Bovaria&nbsp;&#x2026; and yet Bhayar had insisted that Quaeryt recover at one of Bhayar&#x2019;s less imposing estates and wait for the arrival of Vaelora. <br> <i>Is that to keep me away from the commanders and the imagers? Why? So he and Myskyl or Deucalon can see if they can do without me?</i> Somehow, Quaeryt had strong doubts that Bhayar&#x2019;s protestations of concern about him were the only reasons why he had been recuperating in the comparative luxury available at Nordruil, even awaiting Vaelora. Especially since he likely would only be able to spend a few days with her. <br>He paced back across the stones once again. A courier had galloped up less than a glass before, saying that his wife was some three milles away. Since then, every moment of that Mardi afternoon had felt like a quint, every quint like a glass. He&#x2019;d even asked the kitchen staff to have a light afternoon meal ready; not that he felt like eating, but she might well after the long ride. <br> <i>What is taking her so long?</i> He glanced toward the long winding drive once again, then stopped as he saw riders. He forced himself to stand still and wait while they rode up the narrow worn and graveled way. When they were more than a hundred yards away, he could see Vaelora, with Captain Eleryt riding beside her, and a full company following them. <br>Once more, he was amazed at the grace with which she rode and what a striking figure she was in the saddle. <i>But then, you&#x2019;ve always found her so.</i> <br>Their eyes held each other&#x2019;s as soon as she turned her mount around the overgrown garden that the approach drive circled, although neither spoke as she rode toward him and then reined up. <br>&#x201c;My thanks to you, Captain.&#x201d; Quaeryt inclined his head to Eleryt, then stepped down to the mounting block. <br>&#x201c;My pleasure, sir.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt was already looking into Vaelora&#x2019;s light brown eyes, even before she dismounted and stepped into his arms. For several moments he just held her before murmuring, in Bovarian, as they did when alone, &#x201c;I missed you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I missed you, too.&#x201d; Her arms tightened about him. <br>&#x201c;I worried about you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Worried about me? When I heard you&#x2019;d been injured&#x2026;&#x201d; Vaelora eased back. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hurt you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t that kind of injury. I got caught in the ice storm.&#x201d; He lowered his voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better,&#x201d; she whispered as her arms went around him again, if but for a long moment before she stepped back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long ride, and I was so worried.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Would you like something to eat?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you wouldn&#x2019;t mind, dearest.&#x201d; Her smile was impish. &#x201c;If it doesn&#x2019;t take too long to prepare&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Those should have been my words,&#x201d; he replied with a soft laugh. <br>&#x201c;I said them for you&nbsp;&#x2026; but I am hungry.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought you might be. I asked the kitchen to have a light meal ready.&#x201d; Quaeryt turned to Eleryt, who remained waiting. &#x201c;I do apologize, Captain, for my preoccupation. There are refreshments for you and your men and quarters as well. Lord Bhayar has requested that you remain here until further notice. I trust that will not inconvenience you and them.&#x201d; <br>Eleryt smiled. &#x201c;Sir&nbsp;&#x2026; that is not a problem.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt understood that, since Eleryt&#x2019;s company would have better quarters and fare. &#x201c;We will talk later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br>As two of the rankers assigned to Nordruil hurried out to unload Vaelora&#x2019;s gear, Quaeryt took his wife&#x2019;s arm and led her through an ancient square arch into the hold house, guiding her toward the shaded rear terrace beside the fountains, far cooler than any chamber inside. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been here before,&#x201d; said Vaelora, her eyes taking in the stone walls of the main corridor as they passed through the receiving hall. <br>&#x201c;Until last week, I don&#x2019;t think Bhayar had been, either,&#x201d; replied Quaeryt. The thought that Bhayar had so many properties that he&#x2019;d never even visited one as large as Nordruil&#x2014;and that Bhayar thought it small&#x2014;still amazed Quaeryt, although he understood how that could be as they walked past the matching parlors, and then the main dining hall and the grand salon, and finally into the study, with its single wall of books, and out through the double doors and onto the terrace, where a table for two awaited them. <br>&#x201c;What would you like to drink?&#x201d; asked Quaeryt after he seated her. <br>&#x201c;A pale or amber lager, please.&#x201d; Vaelora looked to the serving woman. <br>&#x201c;Two, please,&#x201d; added Quaeryt. <br>The one serving woman eased away, and another placed melon slices before each of them, graced on the side with lime wedges. The first returned with two beakers of a pale golden lager. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Quaeryt quietly. <br>Vaelora immediately took a lime wedge and squeezed it over the melon, then began to devour the melon&#x2014;if gracefully, Quaeryt noted. <br>He ate his own melon not quite so quickly, but asked as he finished, &#x201c;How was your journey?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I ate that so quickly.&#x201d; Vaelora blotted her lips with the pale cream linen napkin. &#x201c;The ride was long and hard. I&#x2019;m a bit sore in places. I was so worried about you. Yet I had the feeling that you would be all right. Then I worried I was deceiving myself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I worried about you&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You need to worry about yourself, dearest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I usually don&#x2019;t have time for that, and when I do, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, and I worry about you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Keep saying things like that.&#x201d; Vaelora took a sip of the lager. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t bad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For the south, you mean?&#x201d; Quaeryt grinned. <br>Vaelora returned the expression. <br>In the momentary silence he could hear the raucous call of a bird, most likely a redjay, coming from the gardens to beyond the lawn behind the terrace. <br>The first serving woman removed the melon platters, and the second replaced them with strips of chilled seasoned fowl, accompanied by sliced early peaches drizzled with thick cream. <br>Quaeryt was surprised to find that he was actually hungry, and neither of them spoke for a time. <br>&#x201c;Are you going to tell me what happened?&#x201d; asked Vaelora. After a moment she went on. &#x201c;Bhayar met me in Ferravyl. He told me about the ice storm, and how the imagers exploded the Bovarian barges.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. <br>&#x201c;Dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; he is my brother, and we spoke for less than a glass. He was very earnest in not wanting to delay my reaching you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain he was earnest about that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We can talk about him later. I want to know about you.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt glanced to the side of the terrace where the two servers stood, then back to Vaelora. <br>She nodded in understanding. &#x201c;Just what happened, although they may not speak Bovarian that well.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The ice came down in sheets. Most of it covered the Bovarians. Bhayar said that we lost almost a battalion. They lost close to eight regiments. It was truly awful.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Yet&nbsp;&#x2026; we were so evenly matched that&nbsp;&#x2026; without the storm&nbsp;&#x2026; we both might have lost even more.&#x201d; He shook his head. <br>&#x201c;What about you? When I heard&nbsp;&#x2026; That was why I rode from first light into the night every day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was caught close to the ice. They told me I didn&#x2019;t wake for three days, and they weren&#x2019;t sure I would. They piled quilts over me&#x2026;&#x201d; He shook his head wryly. &#x201c;I finally woke up sweating.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You did too much.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anything less wouldn&#x2019;t have worked.&#x201d; His eyes again flicked toward the serving women. <br>&#x201c;You can tell me more&nbsp;&#x2026; later.&#x201d; Vaelora took a last swallow from her beaker. As she set it down, her eyes met his again. <br>Quaeryt blushed. <br>&#x201c;Would you mind&nbsp;&#x2026; dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; if I bathed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You could&nbsp;&#x2026; keep me company&#x2026;&#x201d; Her smile and eyes were more than inviting as she glanced to the upper levels of the hold house and then back to Quaeryt. <br>As he rose and guided her from her chair, Quaeryt doubted he would recall what he ate. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Later&#x2014;much later, in the orangish glow of twilight&#x2014;Vaelora sat up in the ancient goldenwood bed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at me as if you&#x2019;ve never seen me this way before.&#x201d; <br> <i>I haven&#x2019;t&nbsp;&#x2026; not exactly like this&nbsp;&#x2026; not understanding what I might have lost.</i> &#x201c;I told you. I missed you. There were times when I didn&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d see you again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got my letters?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I got the note you left in my saddlebag, and the one you wrote about the warm rain&nbsp;&#x2026; that was what made it all possible. I don&#x2019;t know that I would have thought it out without your letter.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad. I think you would have, but I wanted to make sure&nbsp;&#x2026; or try to.&#x201d; After a moment she went on. &#x201c;I told you that Bhayar did not wish to delay my reaching you. After seeing your bruises and&nbsp;&#x2026; everything&nbsp;&#x2026; I can see why.&#x201d; She reached out and let her fingers run down the side of his face, along his jawline, before leaning forward and kissing him. Then she straightened, slightly disentangling herself from his arms. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. Nor are you. Not in the next few days, anyway.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. &#x201c;He told you that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He told me more than that. He was proud of what you did. He won&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;How did you do it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; it had to be more than warm rain, did it not?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was mostly warm rain&#x2026;&#x201d; He paused, yet&nbsp;&#x2026; who else could he tell? &#x201c;Imaging takes heat&nbsp;&#x2026; or something like it. Everyone thinks that the rain froze the Bovarians.&#x201d; He shook his head slowly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not certain, but I think the imaging froze them first, and the ice rain coated them afterward.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The imaging&nbsp;&#x2026; it sucked the warmth out of them?&#x201d; <br>He nodded. &#x201c;I fear so.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you told Bhayar?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told no one but you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. Never tell anyone else.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I dare not tell Bhayar. Not the way he is playing us both.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course he is. What else would you expect? You&#x2019;ve proved to be a great weapon, and you love me, and I love you. He&#x2019;ll use both of us to become the ruler of all Lydar&nbsp;&#x2026; or destroy us all in trying.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt was still astounded at the matter-of-fact way in which she regarded her brother and how she could balance sisterly affection with cold calculation in assessing Bhayar. <i>Then again, it could just be that women are better at that than men.</i> Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know. He only knew that Vaelora was adept at seeing the undercurrents between people, but he&#x2019;d never really known another woman, except in a casual sense, and he&#x2019;d never talked as honestly to anyone as he did to her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see destroying him, first or later, as a good idea, either.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, someone has to unite Lydar, and we&#x2019;ll all be better off under him&nbsp;&#x2026; especially with you at his side.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not exactly a foregone conclusion,&#x201d; Quaeryt pointed out. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s anything but,&#x201d; Vaelora replied, &#x201c;except the alternatives would be less happy for both of us.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt nodded slowly. History indicated that the relatives of unsuccessful conquerors seldom survived, and an imager who served such a ruler certainly wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;unless they fled in obscurity, and that wasn&#x2019;t a path Quaeryt wanted to take&nbsp;&#x2026; and doubted Vaelora did, either. <br>He laughed, not quite bitterly. &#x201c;That appears to be settled.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s another complication, dearest.&#x201d; Vaelora smiled. <br>&#x201c;Complication?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s early&nbsp;&#x2026; but women in our family know almost immediately.&#x201d; <br> <i>Women in your family?</i> Quaeryt swallowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>She nodded. &#x201c;I feel that she&#x2019;ll be a girl.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does Bhayar know?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. And he won&#x2019;t, not until long after you and he leave Ferravyl.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know what to say. <br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;&#x2026; decided&nbsp;&#x2026; on those last days in Tresrives. I knew you&#x2019;d be safe. But&nbsp;&#x2026; I still couldn&#x2019;t let you go&nbsp;&#x2026; not without&nbsp;&#x2026; I just couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Her eyes were bright. <br>Quaeryt leaned forward and folded his arms around her. &#x201c;I love you. I love you both&#x2026;&#x201d; He could feel his own eyes tearing up. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by L. E.

His books routinely top the bestseller lists in Europe, and he's won many prestigious Nordic crime-writing awards, including the Glass Key Award&#x2014;also won by Henning Mankell, Jo Nesb�, Stieg&nbsp;Larsson, and Peter H�eg. He lives in Denmark.<p><b>Prologue</b></p><p>It was the third morning, and the smell of tar and seaweed had got into his clothes. Under the boathouse floor, the mush of ice lapped soundlessly against the wooden stilts and awakened memories of days when everything had been all right.</p><p>He lifted his upper body from the bedding of waste paper and pulled himself sufficiently upright as to be able to make out his younger brother&#x2019;s face, which even in sleep seemed tormented, chilled to the bone.</p><p>Soon, he would wake and glance around in panic. He would feel the leather straps tight around his wrists and waist and hear the jangle of the chain that constrained him. He would see the snowstorm and the light as it struggled to penetrate the tarred timber planks. And then he would start to pray.</p><p>Countless were the times desperation had sprung forth in his brother&#x2019;s eyes. Through the heavy-duty tape that covered his mouth came the repeated sound of his muffled pleas that Jehovah have mercy upon them.</p><p>Yet both of them knew that Jehovah no longer paid heed, for blood had passed their lips. Blood that their jailer had let drip into their cups. The cups from which he had allowed them to drink before revealing to them what they had contained. They had drunk water, but in the water was blood, so forbidden, and now they were damned for ever. And for that reason, shame pierced deeper even than thirst.</p><p><i>What do you think he&#x2019;ll do to us?</i> his brother&#x2019;s frightened eyes seemed so incessantly to ask. But how could he ever know the answer? All he knew was that he had an instinctive feeling that it would all soon be over.</p><p>He leaned backwards and scanned the room once again in the dim light, allowing his gaze to pass across the collar beams and through the formations of cobwebs, noting each and every projection, each and every knot. The worn paddles and oars that hung from the apex of the ceiling. The rotten fishing nets that had long since made their last catch.</p><p>And then he discovered the bottle. A gleam of sunlight played momentarily on the blue-white glass to dazzle him.</p><p>So near, and yet so hard to reach. It was just behind him, wedged between the thick, rough-hewn planks of the floor.</p><p>He stuck his fingers through the gap and tried to prise the bottle upwards by the neck, but the air froze upon his skin. When the thing came loose, he would smash it and use the shards to cut through the strap that kept his hands tied tight together behind his back. And when it succumbed, his numb fingers would find the buckle at his spine. He would loosen it, tear the tape from his mouth, remove the straps from around his waist and thighs, and as soon as the chain that was fastened to the leather strap at his waist no longer held him back, he would lunge forward and free his brother. He would draw him towards him and hold him tight until their bodies ceased to tremble.</p><p>Then, he imagined, he would use all his strength to gouge into the timber around the door with the broken glass. He would see if he could hollow out the planks on which the hinges were placed. And if the worst should happen and the car came before he was finished, he would lie in wait for the man. He would stand poised behind the door with the broken glass in his hand. That was what he told himself he would do.</p><p>He leaned forward, folded his freezing fingers behind his back and prayed for forgiveness for his wicked thought.</p><p>Then he scraped again in the space between the planks to try to free the bottle. He scraped and scratched until the neck angled enough for him to grab hold of it.</p><p>He listened.</p><p>Was that an engine? Yes, it was. The powerful engine of a large car. But was it approaching or simply passing by in the distance out there?</p><p>For a moment, the low, deep sound seemed to get louder. He began to pull so desperately at the neck of the bottle that his knuckles cracked audibly. But then the sound died away. Had it been the wind turbines, rumbling and whirring? Maybe it was something else entirely. He had no idea.</p><p>He expelled warm breath from his nostrils. It steamed the air around his face. He wasn&#x2019;t so afraid any more, not now. As long as he thought about the grace of Jehovah, he felt better.</p><p>He pressed his lips together and laboured on. And when finally the bottle came free, he struck it so hard against the timber of the floor that his brother lifted his head with a startled jolt and looked around in terror.</p><p>Again and again, he brought the bottle down against the floor. It was hard to get purchase with his hands behind his back. Too hard. Eventually, when his fingers were no longer able to maintain their grip, he let the bottle slide from his hand, turned himself around and stared emptily at it as dust gently descended through the cramped space from the beams.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t break it. He simply wasn&#x2019;t able. A pathetic little bottle. Was it because they had drunk blood? Had Jehovah abandoned them?</p><p>He looked at his brother, who rolled himself slowly into his blanket and fell back on to his bedding. He was silent, not even attempting to mumble a word through the tape that sealed his lips.</p><br><br><p>It took a while to gather the things he needed. The hardest part was stretching himself, confined by his chain, to reach the tar between the roofing planks with the tips of his fingers. Everything else was at hand: the bottle, the sharp sliver of wood from the timbered floor, the paper on which he was sitting.</p><p>He pushed off one of his shoes and stabbed so sharply at his wrist with the sliver that tears welled in his eyes. He let the blood drip on to his polished shoe for a minute, perhaps two. Then he tore a large shred of paper from his bedding, dipped the wooden fragment in his blood and twisted his body, pulling at his chain, until he was able to see what he was writing behind his back. As best he could, and in the smallest of handwriting, he put down in words what was happening to them. When he had finished, he signed the letter with his name, rolled up the paper and stuffed it inside the bottle.</p><p>He allowed himself plenty of time to press the lump of tar down into the neck. He shifted his weight so as to see better, and checked and double-checked to make sure it was well done.</p><p>When finally there was no more to do, he heard the dull sound of a car engine. This time there was no mistake. He cast a pained glance at his little brother and stretched with all his might towards the light that seeped in through a broad crack in the timbered wall, the only opening through which the bottle would be able to pass.</p><p>Then the door was opened and a thick shadow entered amid a flurry of white snow.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>And then the plop.</p><p>The bottle was released.</p></p><h2>Winter of the World</h2><p><strong>"NOTE: The font size for this ASIN is 10pt"</strong><br>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

The second she walked into the kitchen she felt the hostility, like the bone-deep cold of the wind that blew through the streets of Berlin before a February snowstorm. She almost turned and walked back out again.<br><br>It was unusual for them to fight. Mostly they were affectionate&#x2014;too much so. Carla cringed when they kissed in front of other people. Her friends thought it was strange: their parents did not do that. She had said that to her mother, once. Mother had laughed in a pleased way and said: &#x201c;The day after our wedding, your father and I were separated by the Great War.&#x201d; She had been born English, though you could hardly tell. &#x201c;I stayed in London while he came home to Germany and joined the army.&#x201d; Carla had heard this story many times, but Mother never tired of telling it. &#x201c;We thought the war would last three months, but I didn&#x2019;t see him again for five years. All that time I longed to touch him. Now I never tire of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was just as bad. &#x201c;Your mother is the cleverest woman I ever met,&#x201d; he had said here in the kitchen just a few days ago. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I married her. It had nothing to do with . . .&#x201d; He had trailed off, and Mother and he had giggled conspiratorially, as if Carla at the age of eleven knew nothing about sex. It was so embarrassing.<br><br>But once in a while they had a quarrel. Carla knew the signs. And a new one was about to erupt.<br><br>They were sitting at opposite ends of the kitchen table. Father was somberly dressed in a dark gray suit, starched white shirt, and black satin tie. He looked dapper, as always, even though his hair was receding and his waistcoat bulged a little beneath the gold watch chain. His face was frozen in an expression of false calm. Carla knew that look. He wore it when one of the family had done something that angered him.<br><br>He held in his hand a copy of the weekly magazine for which Mother worked, The Democrat. She wrote a column of political and diplomatic gossip under the name of Lady Maud. Father began to read aloud. &#x201c;&#x2018; &#x2018;Our new chancellor, Herr Adolf Hitler, made his debut in diplomatic society at President Hindenburg&#x2019;s reception.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>The president was the head of state, Carla knew. He was elected, but he stood above the squabbles of day-to-day politics, acting as referee. The chancellor was the premier. Although Hitler had been made chancellor, his Nazi Party did not have an overall majority in the Reichstag&#x2014;the German parliament&#x2014;so, for the present, the other parties could restrain Nazi excesses.<br><br>Father spoke with distaste, as if forced to mention something repellent, like sewage. &#x201c; &#x2018;He looked uncomfortable in a formal tailcoat.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Carla&#x2019;s mother sipped her coffee and looked out of the window to the street, as if interested in the people hurrying to work in scarves and gloves. She, too, was pretending to be calm, but Carla knew she was just waiting for her moment.<br><br>The maid, Ada, was standing at the counter in an apron, slicing cheese. She put a plate in front of Father, but he ignored it. &#x201c; &#x2018;Herr Hitler was evidently charmed by Elisabeth Cerruti, the cultured wife of the Italian ambassador, in a rose-pink velvet gown trimmed with sable.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Mother always wrote about what people were wearing. She said it helped the reader picture them. She herself had fine clothes, but times were hard and she had not bought anything new for years. This morning she looked slim and elegant in a navy blue cashmere dress that was probably as old as Carla.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Signora Cerruti, who is Jewish, is a passionate Fascist, and they talked for many minutes. Did she beg Hitler to stop whipping up hatred of Jews?&#x2019;&#x201d; Father put the magazine down on the table with a slap.<br><br>Here it comes, Carla thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize that will infuriate the Nazis,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Mother said coolly. &#x201c;The day they&#x2019;re pleased with what I write, I shall give it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dangerous when riled.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother&#x2019;s eyes flashed anger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare condescend to me, Walter. I know they&#x2019;re dangerous&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I oppose them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see the point of making them irate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You attack them in the Reichstag.&#x201d; Father was an elected parliamentary representative for the Social Democratic Party.<br><br>&#x201c;I take part in a reasoned debate.&#x201d;<br><br>This is typical, Carla thought. Father was logical, cautious, law-abiding. Mother had style and humor. He got his way by quiet persistence, she with charm and cheek. They would never agree.<br><br>Father added: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t drive the Nazis mad with fury.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps that&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t do them much harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was irritated by her quick wit. His voice became louder. &#x201c;And you think you damage them with jokes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mock them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s your substitute for argument.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe we need both.&#x201d;<br><br>Father became angrier. &#x201c;But, Maud, don&#x2019;t you see how you&#x2019;re putting yourself and your family at risk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary. The real danger is not to mock the Nazis. What would life be like for our children if Germany became a Fascist state?&#x201d;<br><br>This kind of talk made Carla feel queasy. She could not bear to hear that the family was in danger. Life must go on as it always had. She wished she could sit in this kitchen for an eternity of mornings, with her parents at opposite ends of the pine table, Ada at the counter, and her brother, Erik, thumping around upstairs, late again. Why should anything change?<br><br>She had listened to political talk every breakfast-time of her life and she thought she understood what her parents did, and how they planned to make Germany a better place for everyone. But lately they had begun to talk in a different way. They seemed to think that a terrible danger loomed, but Carla could not quite imagine what it was.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;God knows I&#x2019;m doing everything I can to hold back Hitler and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so am I. But, when you do it, you believe you&#x2019;re following a sensible course.&#x201d; Mother&#x2019;s face hardened in resentment. &#x201c;And when I do it I&#x2019;m accused of putting the family at risk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And with good reason,&#x201d; said Father. The row was only just getting started, but at that moment Erik came down, clattering like a horse on the stairs, and lurched into the kitchen with his school satchel swinging from his shoulder. He was thirteen, two years older than Carla, and there were unsightly black hairs sprouting from his upper lip. When they were small, Carla and Erik had played together all the time; but those days were over, and since he had grown so tall he had pretended to think she was stupid and childish. In fact she was smarter than he, and knew about a lot of things he did not understand, such as women&#x2019;s monthly cycles.<br><br>&#x201c;What was that last tune you were playing?&#x201d; he said to Mother.<br><br>The piano often woke them in the morning. It was a Steinway grand&#x2014;inherited, like the house itself, from Father&#x2019;s parents. Mother played in the morning because, she said, she was too busy the rest of the day and too tired in the evening. This morning she had performed a Mozart sonata, then a jazz tune. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Tiger Rag,&#x2019;&#x201d; she told Erik. &#x201c;Do you want some cheese?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jazz is decadent,&#x201d; Erik said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly.&#x201d;<br><br>Ada handed Erik a plate of cheese and sliced sausage, and he began to shovel it in. Carla thought his manners were dreadful.<br><br>Father looked severe. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s been teaching you this nonsense, Erik?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann Braun says that jazz isn&#x2019;t music, just Negroes making a noise.&#x201d; Hermann was Erik&#x2019;s best friend; his father was a member of the Nazi Party.<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann should try to play it.&#x201d; Father looked at Mother, and his face softened. She smiled at him. He went on: &#x201c;Your mother tried to teach me ragtime, many years ago, but I couldn&#x2019;t master the rhythm.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother laughed. &#x201c;It was like trying to get a giraffe to roller-skate.&#x201d;<br><br>The fight was over, Carla saw with relief. She began to feel better. She took some black bread and dipped it in milk.<br><br>But now Erik wanted an argument. &#x201c;Negroes are an inferior race,&#x201d; he said defiantly.<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt that,&#x201d; Father said patiently. &#x201c;If a Negro boy were brought up in a nice house full of books and paintings, and sent to an expensive school with good teachers, he might turn out to be smarter than you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous!&#x201d; Erik protested.<br><br>Mother put in: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call your father ridiculous, you foolish boy.&#x201d; Her tone was mild: she had used up her anger on Father. Now she just sounded wearily disappointed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, and neither does Hermann Braun.&#x201d;<br><br>Erik said: &#x201c;But the Aryan race must be superior&#x2014;we rule the world!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your Nazi friends don&#x2019;t know any history,&#x201d; Father said. &#x201c;The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids when Germans were living in caves. Arabs ruled the world in the Middle Ages&#x2014;the Muslims were doing algebra when German princes could not write their own names. It&#x2019;s nothing to do with race.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla frowned and said: &#x201c;What is it to do with, then?&#x201d;<br><br>Father looked at her fondly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good question, and you&#x2019;re a bright girl to ask it.&#x201d; She glowed with pleasure at his praise. &#x201c;Civilizations rise and fall&#x2014;the Chinese, the Aztecs, the Romans&#x2014;but no one really knows why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eat up, everyone, and put your coats on,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d;<br><br>Father pulled his watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it with raised eyebrows. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to take Carla to the Francks&#x2019; house,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;The girls&#x2019; school is closed for a day&#x2014;something about repairing the furnace&#x2014;so Carla&#x2019;s going to spend today with Frieda.&#x201d;<br><br>Frieda Franck was Carla&#x2019;s best friend. Their mothers were best friends, too. In fact, when they were young, Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, had been in love with Father&#x2014;a hilarious fact that Frieda&#x2019;s grandmother had revealed one day after drinking too much Sekt.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t Ada look after Carla?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ada has an appointment with the doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla expected Father to ask what was wrong with Ada, but he nodded as if he already knew, and put his watch away. Carla wanted to ask, but something told her she should not. She made a mental note to ask Mother later. Then she immediately forgot about it.<br><br>Father left first, wearing a long black overcoat. Then Erik put on his cap&#x2014;perching it as far back on his head as it would go without falling off, as was the fashion among his friends&#x2014;and followed Father out of the door.<br><br>Carla and her mother helped Ada clear the table. Carla loved Ada almost as much as she loved her mother. When Carla was little, Ada had taken care of her full-time, until she was old enough to go to school, for Mother had always worked. Ada was not married yet. She was twenty-nine and homely-looking, though she had a lovely kind smile. Last summer she had had a romance with a policeman, Paul Huber, but it had not lasted.<br><br>Carla and her mother stood in front of the mirror in the hall and put on their hats. Mother took her time. She chose a dark blue felt, with a round crown and a narrow brim, the type all the women were wearing, but she tilted hers at a different angle, making it look chic. As Carla put on her knitted wool cap, she wondered whether she would ever have Mother&#x2019;s sense of style. Mother looked like a goddess of war, her long neck and chin and cheekbones carved out of white marble; beautiful, yes, but definitely not pretty. Carla had the same dark hair and green eyes, but looked more like a plump doll than a statue. Carla had once accidentally overheard her grandmother say to Mother: &#x201c;Your ugly duckling will grow into a swan, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Carla was still waiting for it to happen.<br><br>When Mother was ready, they went out. Their home stood in a row of tall, gracious town houses in the Mitte district, the old center of the city, built for high-ranking ministers and army officers such as Carla&#x2019;s grandfather, who had worked at the nearby government buildings.<br><br>Carla and her mother rode a tram along Unter den Linden, then took the S train from Friedrich Strasse to the Zoo Station. The Francks lived in the southwestern suburb of Sch�neberg.<br><br>Carla was hoping to see Frieda&#x2019;s brother Werner, who was fourteen. She liked him. Sometimes Carla and Frieda imagined they each married the other&#x2019;s brother, and were next-door neighbors, and their children were best friends. It was just a game to Frieda, but Carla was secretly serious. Werner was handsome and grown-up and not a bit silly like Erik. In the dollhouse in Carla&#x2019;s bedroom, the mother and father sleeping side by side in the miniature double bed were called Carla and Werner, but no one knew that, not even Frieda.<br><br>Frieda had another brother, Axel, seven, but he had been born with spina bifida, and had to have constant medical care. He lived in a special hospital on the outskirts of Berlin.<br><br>Mother was preoccupied on the journey. &#x201c;I hope this is going to be all right,&#x201d; she muttered, half to herself, as they got off the train.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it will,&#x201d; Carla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a lovely time with Frieda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that. I&#x2019;m talking about my paragraph about Hitler.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are we in danger? Was Father right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your father is usually right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will happen to us if we&#x2019;ve annoyed the Nazis?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother stared at her strangely for a long moment, then said: &#x201c;Dear God, what kind of a world did I bring you into?&#x201d; Then she went quiet.<br><br>After a ten-minute walk they arrived at a grand villa in a big garden. The Francks were rich: Frieda&#x2019;s father, Ludwig, owned a factory making radio sets. Two cars stood in the driveway. The large shiny black one belonged to Herr Franck. The engine rumbled, and a cloud of blue vapor rose from the tailpipe. The chauffeur, Ritter, with uniform trousers tucked into high boots, stood cap in hand ready to open the door. He bowed and said: &#x201c;Good morning, Frau von Ulrich.&#x201d;<br><br>The second car was a little green two-seater. A short man with a gray beard came out of the house carrying a leather case, and touched his hat to Mother as he got into the small car. &#x201c;I wonder what Dr. Rothmann is doing here so early in the morning,&#x201d; Mother said anxiously.<br><br>They soon found out. Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, came to the door, a tall woman with a mass of red hair. Anxiety showed on her pale face. Instead of welcoming them in, she stood squarely in the doorway as if to bar their entrance. &#x201c;Frieda has measles!&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry!&#x201d; said Mother. &#x201c;How is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miserable. She has a fever and a cough. But Rothmann says she&#x2019;ll be all right. However, she&#x2019;s quarantined.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Have you had it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;when I was a girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Werner has, too&#x2014;I remember he had a terrible rash all over. But what about your husband?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Ludi had it as a boy.&#x201d;<br><br>Both women looked at Carla. She had never had measles. She realized this meant she could not spend the day with Frieda.<br><br>Carla was disappointed, but Mother was quite shaken. &#x201c;This week&#x2019;s magazine is our election issue&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t be absent.&#x201d; She looked distraught. All the grown-ups were apprehensive about the general election to be held next Sunday. Mother and Father both feared the Nazis might do well enough to take full control of the government. &#x201c;Plus my oldest friend is visiting from London. I wonder whether Walter could be persuaded to take a day off to look after Carla?&#x201d;<br><br>Monika said: &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you telephone him?&#x201d;<br><br>Not many people had phones in their homes, but the Francks did, and Carla and her mother stepped into the hall. The instrument stood on a spindly-legged table near the door. Mother picked it up and gave the number of Father&#x2019;s office at the Reichstag, the parl...</p><h2>Who Fears Death</h2><p><b>Now optioned as a TV series for HBO, with executive producer George R.

She is know for her young adult novels, including <em>The Shadow Speaker</em> and <em>Zahrah the Windseeker</em>. </b> <br> <br> <i>&#x201c;My life fell apart when I was sixteen. Papa died.&#x201d;</i> <br> <br> Those are the opening lines of <i>Who Fears Death</i>. I remember when I wrote them. I was thinking of Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s <i>Things Fall Apart</i>. I was thinking of change, cultural shift, chaos. Okonkwo&#x2019;s death. And my own father&#x2019;s very recent death. Yeah, all that in those two lines. <br> <br> In more ways than one, the opening scene of <i>Who Fears Death</i>, titled &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s Face&#x201d;, was the beginning of it all. Originally, it was not the beginning of the novel. This scene takes place well into the story when my main character Onyesonwu is sixteen and has been through so much. The original beginning was when Onyesonwu was five years old and happy, living with her mother in the desert. Nevertheless, &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s Face&#x201d; was the first scene I wrote. <br> <br> Though my stories tend to be mostly linear, I&#x2019;m a non-linear writer. I&#x2019;ll write the middle, then the ending, then the beginning and kind of jump around until I&#x2019;m done. Then I&#x2019;ll tie all the scenes together and neaten it up. Nevertheless, when <i>Who Fears Death</i> was all said and done, I wasn&#x2019;t surprised that &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s Face&#x201d; turned out to be the beginning of the actual book. <br> <br> I started writing <i>Who Fears Death</i> just after my father passed in 2004. I was very very close to my father and writing was my way of staying sane. I based &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s Face&#x201d; on a moment I experienced at my father&#x2019;s wake when everyone had cleared out of the room and I found myself alone with his body. <br> <br> I was kneeling there looking at his face, thinking how much it no longer looked like him and how terrible that was. My morbid thoughts were driving me into deeper despair. Then suddenly I felt an energy move though me. This energy felt highly destructive, as if it could bring down the entire building. Almost all the details in the scene I went on to write were true, I felt them...well, up to the part where Onyesonwu makes her father&#x2019;s body breath. <br> <br> As soon as I wrote that scene, everything else rushed at me. My father&#x2019;s passing caused me to think about death, fear, the unknown, sacrifice, destiny and cosmic trickery. Only a week or so after my father&#x2019;s passing, I read the Washington Post article, <i>We Want to Make a Light Baby: Arab Militiamen in Sudan Said to Use Rape as Weapon of Ethnic Cleansing</i> by Emily Wax. I was absolutely infuriated. The storytelling spider in my head started weaving faster. I realized that this article was showing me why the people in my story&#x2019;s town disliked Onyesonwu and why she was so troubled. <br> <br> My mother, my sister Ifeoma and my brother Emezie flew with my father&#x2019;s body back to Nigeria for his burial. When they returned, I learned through my siblings about the way widows were treated within Igbo custom, even the ones with PhDs...like my mother. I was again infuriated. And I was reminded yet again of why I was a feminist. <br> <br> A year later, I went to Nigeria for the one-year memorial where I met my cousin Chinyere&#x2019;s fianc� Chidi. His last name was Onyesonwu. I was intrigued. I knew &#x201c;onye&#x201d; meant &#x201c;who&#x201d; and &#x201c;onwu&#x201d; meant death. I wondered if it was an ogbanje name (these named often have the word &#x201c;death&#x201d; in them). I&#x2019;d always been interested in the concept of the ogbanje. Amongst the Igbos, back in the day, girls who were believed to be ogbanjes were often circumcised (a.k.a. genital mutilated) as a way to cure their evil ogbanje tendencies. <br> <br> I asked my cousin&#x2019;s fianc� what his name meant (I thought it would be rude to ask if it was an ogbanje name. Plus it was his last name, not his first.). He said it meant, &#x201c;Who fears death.&#x201d; That night, I changed my character&#x2019;s name and the title of the story. When I did that, it was as if the novel snapped into focus. <br> <br> During that trip, I touched my father&#x2019;s grave. I heard stories about the Biafran War and arguments about how what happened during this civil war was indeed the genocide of the Igbo people. I saw death on the highway and thanked the Powers That Be that my daughter (who was some months over one year old) was asleep. I got to watch the women in my father&#x2019;s village sing all night in remembrance of my father. My maternal grandmother, mother, daughter and I were all in the same room at the same time- four generations. My sister Ngozi and I visited the lagoon that seemed so huge when we were kids but was really quite small. It was populated by hundreds and hundreds of colorful butterflies. <br> <br> I wrote, conceived and incubated parts of <i>Who Fears Death</i> while in my father&#x2019;s village, sometimes scribbling notes while sitting in the shade on the steps outside or by flashlight when the lights went out. I wrote notes on the plane ride home, too. When I think back to those times, I was in such a strange state of mind. My default demeanor is happy. I think during those times I was as close to sad as I could get. <br> <br> When I got back to the States, I kept right on writing. Who Fears Death was a tidal wave and hurricane combined. It consumed all of my creativity and sucked in all the issues I was dealing with and dwelling on. It mixed with my rage and grief and my natural furious optimism. Yet when it came to writing the story, I was more the recorder than the writer. I never knew what was going to happen until my character told me and my hands typed it. When I finished <i>Who Fears Death</i>, it was seven hundred pages long. A Book 1 and a Book 2. Don Maass (my agent) felt this size was too great and suggested that I pare it down. This process took me another two years. <br> <br> One of my favorite quotes is from one of my greatest idols, Nigeria&#x2019;s great writer and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka: &#x201c;A tiger does not proclaim its tigritude. It pounces.&#x201d; This tiger of a story definitely pounced on me without proclamation or warning. I&#x2019;m glad I was ready for it. <br> <br> <em>--Nnedi Okorafor</em><b>Nnedi Okorafor</b>&nbsp;was born in the United States to two Igbo (Nigerian) immigrant parents.

It is her curiosity for how nature works that has led her into such a successful career as a children&#39;s book author and illustrator. Before creating chilren&#39;s books, she worked for NBC television. She has published fity titles with Holiday House. Visit her on the Web at www.gailgibbons.com.Grade 1-3-- Gibbons's penchant for creating interesting, informative nonfiction books for young children appears to be fathomless. Here, she opens the world of island living to mainlanders, providing insight into the activities that occupy the islanders' way of life. The informative text and illustrations transcend the seasons and detail the changes that take place there. The uncluttered, cartoonlike illustrations are clearly labeled and show, for example, the various kinds of boats to be found, how a lobster is trapped, the different kinds of nets used in deep sea fishing, and the tiny village itself, nestled among the rocks and dunes. Life on the island is insular, but for those who live there, it is never dull. Bright and cheerful describe the watercolor pictures, and they are in total complement to the brief text on each page. Clean in appearance, the book offers insightful information in a manner as fresh as a sea breeze. It lends itself naturally to units on where and how others live. Children will want to be Surrounded by Sea as soon as they spy the colorful dust jacket. --Mary Lou Budd, Milford South Elementary School, OH<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bygone Days</h2><p>New! Shelf wear only!</p><p></p><h2>Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War from the Other Side</h2><p>A stunning compilation of 160 never-before-published images by North Vietnamese photographers capture the events of the Vietnam War from a dramatic new perspective and document daily life and battle on the North Vietnamese side.</p><p>The groundbreaking publication <i>Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War from the Other Side</i> is an intense collection of images, many never seen before, from the cameras of North Vietnamese photographers. Each included photographer has a chapter highlighting his personal stories and captivating pictures. The stories are riveting and sometimes ironic: one revolutionary photographer falsified identification cards for Communist fighters, another traveled side by side with guerrillas, while another barely escaped a bombing campaign only to be forever haunted by the loss of his film and equipment. <p> With almost no resources, a serious lack of film, and outdated equipment, these committed photographers used will and determination in order to record history. From film processed under a night sky with homemade chemicals to making one roll of film last for years, each individual tale is a testament to the power of perseverance. Some of the pictures are haunting (a devastated landscape with the intense flare of napalm, an emergency surgery in a mangrove swamp), while others capture a seemingly staged Communist resolve (smiling soldiers with little children, classic hero poses shot from below). This book offers an important pictorial viewpoint and fills in many gaps from the popular Western media coverage of the war. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i></p>Few aspects of the American war in Vietnam have escaped close inspection in this country. So it is startling to see a large, coffee-table book filled with 180 black and white images of that war that have never before been published on these shores. Taken by North Vietnamese photographers, the pictures are a mixture of staged, unabashed propaganda ("I wanted my pictures to be a weapon," says photographer Mai Nam, a longtime Vietnamese Communist Party member) and evocative insights into the way the war appeared from the other side, as when National Liberation Front political leader Ut Mot is shown in an austere underground bunker, light streaming in from a tiny skylight, looking pensive and determined. Accomplished British journalist Page provides running commentary on the war, and the photographers' experiences and reminiscences, particularly those who worked with the Vietcong guerrillas in the South. The book lives up to its billing as a piece of work that will help Americans more fully understand the nation's longest and most controversial overseas war. However, the many photos of smiling North Vietnamese and Vietcong and of captured, wounded and dead South Vietnamese and Americans surely will not warm the hearts of unreconstructed hawks. (Jan.)Forecast: An exhibit featuring more than 150 photos from the book will be held at New York City's International Center of Photography, January-March, and a documentary featuring Page's interviews will air on National Geographic Explorer on MSNBC in January. The book will appeal to the curious and the completist, but may not cross over to greater boomer-based sales. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Halloween Performance</h2><p>Roger plays a small but important part in the school Halloween play.</p><p></p><h2>Parker&#39;s Astrology: The Definitive Guide to Using Astrology in Every Aspect of Your Life (New Edition)</h2><p>A richly illustrated, updated introduction to the world of astrology shows how to draw and interpret birth charts, offers extensive analysis of planetary influences, and includes case studies.</p><p>With its lavish color illustrations, detailed discussions of astrological techniques, and comprehensive chart building tools, <i>Parkers' Astrology</i> is an outstanding book for any serious student of astrology. The husband and wife team of Julia and Derek Parker reissued this edition that offers many new components, such as the recently discovered comet/asteroid Chiron and its eccentric orbit.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I watched.<br>Twenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed out with them.<br>A small soul was in my arms.<br>I stood a little to the right.<br>The dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath was loud that day. I'm surprised the guards didn't notice me as they walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that snow.<br>Perhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was standing, frost-stricken.<br>Her mouth jittered.<br>Her cold arms were folded.<br>Tears were frozen to the book thief's face.</p><h2>The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, and Human Evolution</h2><p><i>The Art Instinct </i>combines two of the most fascinating and contentious disciplines, art and evolutionary science, in a provocative new work that will revolutionize the way art itself is perceived. Aesthetic taste, argues Denis Dutton, is an evolutionary trait, and is shaped by natural selection. It's <i>not</i>, as almost all contemporary art criticism and academic theory would have it, "socially constructed." The human appreciation for art is innate, and certain artistic values are universal across cultures, such as a preference for landscapes that, like the ancient savannah, feature water and distant trees. If people from Africa to Alaska prefer images that would have appealed to our hominid ancestors, what does that mean for the entire discipline of art history? Dutton argues, with forceful logic and hard evidence, that art criticism needs to be premised on an understanding of evolution, not on abstract "theory." Sure to provoke discussion in scientific circles and an uproar in the art world, <i>The Art Instinct</i> offers radical new insights into both the nature of art and the workings of the human mind.</p><p>Denis Dutton founded <i>Arts &amp; Letters Daily</i> and continues to edit the website, one of the <i>Guardian's </i>"best websites in the world," and one of the most heavily trafficked sites anywhere for news and opinion in science, the arts, and politics.

Whether it's baby's breath draped on a table at a wedding reception, clusters of daffodils in small pots scattered throughout a living room or a bucket of sunflowers on a picnic table, a strategically placed bouquet has the power to create a mood and make us feel special. Unfortunately, most of us don't know how to display flowers properly, and they often end up clumsily thrown together in a vase.</p><p>In <em>A Passion for Flowers,</em> Carolyne Roehm teaches readers how to create arrangements that set off a flower's natural beauty. She discusses the overall features of dozens of the most popular flowers and helps readers understand how these elements relate to each other. Though the book is filled with ideas for brightening holidays and special occasions, Roehm stresses that the magic of flowers should be enjoyed year-round. Organized by season to profile the blossoms as they come into their glory, bouquet "recipes" with step-by-step instructions are sprinkled throughout along with special care instructions for more sensitive blooms. Sections detailing containers, conditioning flowers and elements of floral design are included at the end of the book. <em>A Passion for Flowers</em> features 250 breathtaking photographs and is a treasure trove of knowledge and inspiration that will help readers stop and smell the roses every day.</p></p><p>Carolyne Roehm, noted author and lifestyle contributor to Good Morning America, brings her gardening expertise to viewers weekly as the host of Country Homes, Country Gardens.<p>In 1991, Roehm, who had always taken great pleasure in indulging and surrounding herself with things she loved, decided to turn her personal passion for beauty and comfort into a fulfilling career. A longtime associate (and neighbor) of famed couturier, Oscar de la Renta, Roehm began her own fashion business, setting her designs apart from many others in the industry with her unflagging insistence on only the finest quality materials. Her designs quickly found a home with discriminating consumers, as her first year alone saw revenues exceeding $3 million. But Roehm's passion for beauty extended beyond the world of fashion, and she became determined to broaden her horizons accordingly.</p><p>Following a stint at the famed Paris flower shop, Moulie Savart, Roehm took the knowledge she gained there and put it into practical use for the everyday gardener. Resulting from her considerable experience, she takes great joy in revealing the many secrets she learned to help everyone achieve a bountiful and beautiful garden.</p><p>In 1997, Roehm published her first book, A Passion for Flowers (September 1997, HarperCollins Publishers) in which she detailed the experts' tricks to perfect gardening. A firm believer in luxury for everyone, Roehm feels that luxury doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Her breathtaking floral arrangements, for example, traditionally contain many common flowers such as carnations, marigolds, bleeding hearts, and Queen Anne's lace, which she collects from her own garden at her Connecticut home.</p><p>Roehm applies the fashion lessons she learned to her flowers. The familiar cry of "accessorize" is as important to arranging blooms as it is to one's own appearance. "I can't tell you how often I've seen a dress ruined with the wrong accessories," Roehm explains. "It's the same with flowers. Even the most beautiful flowers don't work if they're in the wrong vase or placed against the wrong background."</p></p><h2>Wedding Rows</h2><p>The townspeople of Sitting Marsh finally have a reason to celebrate as wedding preparations begin for a local couple, but when the blessed day ends in murder, Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton, the lady of Manor House, is on the case.

He was a company man who wore a suit and tie when he went to inspect the production and drilling platforms. But one day he stumbled on an opening in the rig floor before setup was completed. He fell sixty feet to the platform below and died instantly, his neck broken.<br>It took me a long time to understand Daddy was never coming back. I waited for him for months, sitting at the front window of our house in Katy, just west of Houston.<br>Some days I stood at the end of the driveway to watch every car that passed. No matter how often Mama told me to quit looking for him, I couldn&#x2019;t give up. I guess I thought the strength of my wanting would be enough to make him appear.<br>I have only a handful of memories of my father, more like impressions. He must have carried me on his shoulders a time or two&#x2014;I remember the hard plane of his chest beneath my calves, the sensation of swaying high in the air, anchored by the strong pressure of his fingers around my ankles. And the coarse drifts of his hair in my hands, shiny black hair cut in layers. I can almost hear his voice singing &#x201c;Arriba del Cielo,&#x201d; a Mexican lullaby that always gave me sweet dreams.<br>There is a framed photograph of Daddy on my dresser, the only one I have. He&#x2019;s wearing a Western dress shirt and jeans with creases pressed down the front, and a tooled leather belt with a silver and turquoise buckle the size of a breakfast plate. A little smile lingers in one corner of his mouth, and a dimple punctuates the smoothness of his swarthy cheek. By all accounts he was a smart man, a romantic, a hard worker with high-carat ambitions. I believe he would have accomplished great things in his life if he&#x2019;d been given the gift of more years. I know so little about my father, but I&#x2019;m certain he loved me. I can feel it even in those little wisps of memory.<br>Mama never found another man to replace Daddy. Or maybe it&#x2019;s more accurate to say she found a lot of men to replace him. But hardly any of them stayed around for long. She was a beautiful woman, if not a happy one, and attracting a man was never a problem. Keeping one, however, was a different matter. By the time I was thirteen, Mama had gone through more boyfriends than I could keep track of. It was sort of a relief when she found one she decided she could stick with for a while.<br>They agreed they would move in together, in the east Texas town of Welcome, not far from where he&#x2019;d grown up. As it turned out, Welcome was where I lost everything, and gained everything. Welcome was the place where my life was guided from one track to another, sending me to places I&#x2019;d never thought of going.<br>On my first day at the trailer park, I wandered along a dead-end road that cut between rows of trailers lined up like piano keys. The park was a dusty grid of dead-end streets, with a newly built loop that circled around the left side. Each home sat on its own concrete pad, dressed in a skirt made of aluminum or wooden latticework. A few trailers were fronted by patches of yard, some featuring crape myrtle with blossoms crisped a pale brown and the bark shredded from the heat.<br>The late afternoon sun was as round and white as a paper plate tacked to the sky. Heat seemed to come equally from below as above, uncurling in visible waves from the cracked ground. Time moved at a crawl in Welcome, where people considered anything needing to be done in a hurry wasn&#x2019;t worth doing. Dogs and cats spent most of the day sleeping in the hot shade, rousing only to lap a few tepid drops from the water hookups. Even the flies were slow.<br>An envelope containing a check crackled in the pocket of my denim cutoffs. Mama had told me to take it to the manager of Bluebonnet Ranch, Mr. Louis Sadlek, who lived at the redbrick house near the entrance of the trailer park.<br>My feet felt like they&#x2019;d been steamed inside my shoes as I shuffled along the broken edges of asphalt. I saw a pair of older boys standing with a teenage girl, their postures relaxed and loose-limbed. The girl had a long blond ponytail with a ball of hair-sprayed bangs in the front. Her deep tan was exposed by short shorts and a tiny purple bikini top, which explained why the boys were so absorbed in conversation with her.<br>One of the boys was dressed in shorts and a tank top, while the other, dark-haired one wore a weathered pair of Wranglers and dirt-caked Roper boots. He stood with his weight shifted to one leg, one thumb hooked in a denim pocket, his free hand gesturing as he talked. There was something striking about his slim, rawboned form, the hard edge of his profile. His vitality was almost jarring in those heat-drowsed surroundings.<br>Although Texans of all ages are naturally sociable and call out to strangers without hesitation, it was obvious I was going to walk by this trio unnoticed. That was just fine with me.<br>But as I walked quietly along the other side of the lane, I was startled by an explosion of noise and movement. Rearing back, I was set upon by what appeared to be a pair of rabid pit bulls. They barked and snarled and peeled their lips back to reveal jagged yellow teeth. I had never been scared of dogs, but these two were obviously out for the kill.<br>My instincts took over, and I spun to escape. The bald soles of my old sneakers slipped on a scattering of pebbles, my feet went out from under me, and I hit the ground on my hands and knees. I let out a scream and covered my head with my arms, fully expecting to be torn to pieces. But there was the sound of an angry voice over the blood rush in my ears, and instead of teeth closing over my flesh, I felt a pair of strong hands take hold of me.<br>I yelped as I was turned over to look up into the face of the dark-haired boy. He gave me a swift assessing glance and turned to yell some more at the pit bulls. The dogs had retreated a few yards, their barking fading to peevish snarls.<br>&#x201c;Go on, damn it,&#x201d; the boy snapped at them. &#x201c;Get your hindquarters back home and stop scaring people, you sorry pair of sh&#x2014;&#x201d; He checked himself and darted a quick glance at me.<br>The pit bulls quieted and slunk backward in a startling change of mood, pink tongues dangling like the half-curled ribbons of party balloons.<br>My rescuer viewed them with disgust and spoke to the boy in the tank top. &#x201c;Pete, take the dogs back to Miss Marva&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll git home by theirselves,&#x201d; the boy protested, reluctant to part company with the blond girl in the bikini top.<br>&#x201c;Take &#x2019;em back,&#x201d; came the authoritative reply, &#x201c;and tell Marva to stop leaving the damn gate open.&#x201d;<br>While this conversation was taking place, I glanced down at my knees and saw they were oozing and peppered with gravel dust. My descent into the pit of soul-shriveling embarrassment was complete as the shock wore off and I started to cry. The harder I gulped against the tightness of my throat, the worse it became. Tears runneled from beneath my big plastic-framed glasses.<br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake...&#x201d; I heard the boy in the tank top mutter. Heaving a sigh, he went to the dogs and grabbed them by the collars. &#x201c;Come on, troublemakers.&#x201d; They went with him willingly, trotting smartly on either side as if they were auditioning for the 4H state dog show.<br>The dark-haired boy&#x2019;s attention returned to me, and his voice gentled. &#x201c;Here, now... you&#x2019;re okay. No need to cry, honey.&#x201d; He plucked a red handkerchief from his back pocket and began to mop at my face. Deftly he wiped my eyes and nose and told me to blow. The handkerchief held the sharp bite of male sweat as it clamped firmly over my nose. Back then men of every age had a red handkerchief tucked in the back pocket of their jeans. I&#x2019;d seen kerchiefs used as a sieve, a coffee filter, a dust mask, and once as a makeshift baby diaper.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever run from dogs like that.&#x201d; The boy tucked the kerchief in his back pocket. &#x201c;No matter how scared you are. You just look to the side and walk away real slow, understand? And shout &#x2018;No&#x2019; in a loud voice like you mean it.&#x201d;<br>I sniffled and nodded, staring into his shadowed face. His wide mouth held the curve of a smile that sent a quiver down to the pit of my stomach and knotted my toes inside my sneakers.<br>True handsomeness had escaped him by millimeters. His features were too blunt and bold, and his nose had a crook near the bridge from having been broken once. But he had a slow burn of a smile, and blue-on-blue eyes that seemed even brighter against the sun-glazed color of his skin, and a tumble of dark brown hair as shiny as mink fur.<br>&#x201c;You got nothing to fear from those dogs,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re full of mischief, but as far as I know they&#x2019;ve never bitten anyone. Here, take my hand.&#x201d;<br>As he pulled me up and set me on my feet, my knees felt like they&#x2019;d been set on fire. I hardly noticed the pain, I was so occupied with the fury of my heartbeat. The grip of his hand was strong around mine, his fingers dry and warm.<br>&#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d; the boy asked. &#x201c;Are you moving into the new trailer on the loop?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; I wiped a stray tear off my chin.<br>&#x201c;Hardy...&#x201d; The blond girl&#x2019;s voice was sweetly cajoling. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s all right now. Come walk me back. I got somethin&#x2019; in my room to show you.&#x201d;<br>Hardy. So that was his name. He remained facing me, his vivid gaze shifting to the ground. It was probably just as well the girl couldn&#x2019;t see the wry smile secreted in the corners of his mouth. He seemed to have a pretty good idea of what she wanted to show him.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said cheerfully. &#x201c;I have to take care of this little one.&#x201d;<br>The disgruntlement I felt at being referred to as if I were a toddler was promptly replaced ...</p></p><h2>The Complete Manual of Woodworking</h2><p>Designed to instruct every woodworker from the beginner to the most exacting expert. 1,800 drawings, diagrams, and photos.

The nightmare knew no bounds as Carter traded his superstar status for a prison number and the concrete walls of some of America's most horrific institutions. Originally published as an attempt by Carter to set the record straight and force a new trial, <i>The Sixteenth Round</i> is timeless. It is an eye-opening portrait of growing up black in America, a scathing indictment of the prison system Carter grew up in and out of, and a mesmerizing re-creation of his furious battles in the ring and in the courtroom set against the backdrop of the turbulent sixties. The liveliness of Carter's street language, its power and ironic humor, makes this an eloquent, soul-stirring account of a remarkable life not soon to be forgotten.</p><p>In 1974, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter's autobiography, <i>THE 16th ROUND</i> was published by Viking. Written from prison, Carter chronicled the twisted events that took him from world middleweight boxing contender to his life sentence as the accused murderer of three people in a New Jersey bar. Joan Baez, Muhammad Ali and Roberta Flack protested his innocence, and Bob Dylan wrote his classic anthem "Hurricane" about Carter's struggle. But it took the determined efforts of a group of Canadians, including Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton to free Rubin Carter."A document of life lived in the center of hell." <i>&#x2014;Sports Illustrated</i><br><br>"When they come to list the greatest boxers, Hurrican's name isn't likely to pop up in the Top 10.

Nurse Matilda is a combination of Mary Poppins, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, and TV's Super Nanny. The three tales of Nurse Matilda's entanglements with the Brown family, which were published individually in the 1960s, might have languished in out-of-print purgatory were it not for a "major motion picture," entitled <i>Nanny McPhee, </i>inspired by the stories. American readers, even those "of a certain age," may not be familiar with the Nanny tales, but there's lots to warm up to, including Ardizzone's lively ink drawings, over-the-top events, and the arch, yet understated, British tone ("I understand that your children are <i>exceed</i>ingly naughty"). And so the Brown children are, mixing up mischief and a bit of violence. One of Brand's funny conceits is that the children are too numerous to be counted, with new ones continually being named. Still, by the third section, in which the children play havoc with several elderly ladies, the bad behavior seems gratuitous and belabored. The book's popularity in the U.S. will probably be tied to the movie's.^B <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Two receptionists, one on the phone. A Japanese guest check�ing in&#x2014;from his accent, obviously from Miyazaka in the south. A concierge printing a map for a couple of tourists. A security man, Eastern European, bored, standing by the door. He saw everything. If the lights had suddenly gone out, or if he had closed his eyes, he would have been able to continue forward at exactly the same pace.<br>&nbsp;Nobody noticed him. It was actually a skill, some�thing he had learned, the art of not being seen. Even the outfit he wore&#x2014;expensive jeans, a gray cashmere jersey, and a loose coat&#x2014;had been chosen because it made no statement at all. The clothes were well-known brands but he had cut out the labels. In the unlikely event that he was stopped by the police, it would be very difficult for them to know where they had been bought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>He was twenty-eight years old. He had fair hair, cut short, and ice-cold eyes with just the faintest trace of blue. He was not large or well built, but there was a sort of sleekness about him. He moved like an athlete&#x2014;perhaps a sprinter approaching the starting blocks&#x2014;but there was asense of danger about him, a feeling that you should leave well alone. He carried three credit cards and a driver&#x2019;s license, issued in Swansea, all with the name Matthew Reddy. A police check would have established that he was a personal trainer, that he worked in a London gym and lived in Brixton. None of this was true. His real name was Yassen Gregorovich. He had been a professional assassin for almost half his life.<br>&nbsp;<br>The hotel was in King&#x2019;s Cross, an area of London with no attractive shops and few decent restaurants, a place where nobody really stays any longer than they have to. It was called The Traveller and it was part of a chain; comfortable but not too expensive. It was the sort of place that had no regular clients. Most of the guests were pass�ing through on business and it would be their companies who paid the bill. They drank in the bar. They ate the &#x201c;full English breakfast&#x201d; in the brightly lit Beefeater restaurant. But they were too busy to socialize and it was unlikely they would return. Yassen preferred it that way. He could have stayed in central London, in the Ritz or the Dorchester, but he knew that the receptionists there were trained to remember the faces of the people who passed through the revolving doors. Such personal attention was the last thing he wanted.<br>&nbsp;<br>A security camera watched him as he approached the elevators. He was aware of it blinking over his left shoul�der. The camera was annoying but inevitable. London has more of these devices than any city in Europe, and the police and secret service have access to all of them. Yassen made sure he didn&#x2019;t look up. If you look at a camera, that is when it sees you. He reached the elevators but ignored them, slipping through a fire door that led to the stairs. He would never think of confining himself in a small space, a metal box with doors that he couldn&#x2019;t open, sur�rounded by strangers. That would be madness. He would have walked fifteen stories if it had been necessary&#x2014;and when he reached the top, he wouldn&#x2019;t even have been out of breath. Yassen kept himself in superb condition, spend�ing two hours in the gym every day when that luxury was available to him, working out on his own when it wasn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, he was on the second floor. He had thoroughly checked the hotel on the Internet before he made his res�ervation, and number 217 was one of just four rooms that exactly met his demands. It was on the second floor, too high up to be reached from the street but low enough for him to jump out the window if he had to&#x2014;after shoot�ing out the glass. It was not overlooked. There were other buildings around, but any form of surveillance would be difficult. When Yassen went to bed, he never closed the curtains. He liked to see out, to watch for any movement in the street. Every city has a natural rhythm, and anything that breaks it&#x2014;a man lingering on a corner or a car pass�ing the same way twice&#x2014;might warn him that it was time to leave at once. And he never slept for more than four hours, not even in the most comfortable bed.<br>&nbsp;<br>A DO NOT DISTURB sign hung in front of him as he turned the corner and approached the door. Had it been obeyed? Yassen reached into his pants pocket and took out a small silver device, about the same size and shape as a pen. He pressed one end, covering the handle with a thin spray of diazafluoren&#x2014;a simple chemical re-agent. Quickly, he spun the pen around and pressed the other end, activating a fluorescent light. There were no finger�prints. If anyone had gone into the room since he had left, they had wiped the handle clean. He put the pen away, then knelt down and checked the bottom of the door. Ear�lier in the day, he had placed a single hair across the crack. It was one of the oldest warning signals in the book, but that didn&#x2019;t stop it from being effective. The hair was still in place. Yassen straightened up and went in using his elec�tronic pass key.<br>&nbsp;<br>It took him less than a minute to ascertain that every�thing was exactly as he had left it. His briefcase was 4.6 centimeters from the edge of the desk. His suitcase was positioned at a 95-degree angle from the wall. There were no fingerprints on either of the locks. He removed the dig�ital tape recorder that had been clipped magnetically to the side of his service fridge and glanced at the dial. Noth�ing had been recorded. Nobody had been in. Many people would have found all these precautions annoying and time consuming, but for Yassen they were as much a part of his daily routine as tying his shoelaces or brushing his teeth.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was twelve minutes past six when he sat down at the desk and opened his computer, an ordinary laptop. His password had seventeen digits and he changed it every month. He took off his watch and laid it on the surface beside him. Then he went into eBay, left-clicked on Col�lectibles, and scrolled through Coins. He soon found what he was looking for: a gold coin showing the head of the emperor Caligula with the date 11 AD. There had been no bids for this particular coin because, as any collector would know, it did not in fact exist. In 11 AD, the mad Roman emperor Caligula had not even been born. The entire website was a fake and looked it. The name of the coin dealer&#x2014;Mintomatic&#x2014;had been specially chosen to put off any casual purchaser. Mintomatic was supposedly based in Shanghai and did not have Top-Rated Seller sta�tus. All the coins it advertised were either fake or valueless.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yassen sat quietly until a quarter past six. At exactly the moment that the second hand passed over the twelve on his watch, he pressed the button to place a bid, then entered his User ID&#x2014;false, of course&#x2014;and password. Finally, he entered a bid of $2,418.12. The figures were based on the day&#x2019;s date and the exact time. He pressed Enter and a window opened that had nothing to do with eBay or with Roman coins. Nobody else could have seen it. It would have been impossible to discover where it had originated. The message had been bounced around a dozen countries, traveling through an anonymity network, before it had reached him. This is known as &#x201c;onion rout�ing&#x201d; because of its many layers. It had also passed through an encrypted tunnel, a secure shell that ensured that only Yassen could read what had been written. If someone had managed to arrive at the same screen by accident, they would have seen only nonsense, and within three seconds a virus would have entered their computer and obliter�ated the motherboard. The computer, however, had been authorized to receive the message, and Yassen saw three words.<br>&nbsp;<br>KILL ALEX RIDER<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>They were exactly what he had expected.</p><h2>Negotiating a Labor Contract : A Management Handbook</h2><p>Negotiating a Labor Contract: A Management Handbook, Third Edition, gives you the winning strategies you need to meet the increasingly complex challenges of labor contract negotiations today.

Hence, he offers this personal and informative cookbook that focuses on braised meat. Boulud begins with notes on the technique, key equipment, ingredients and helpful tips before embarking on the more than 100 neatly organized recipes such as Veal Breast with Cinnamon and Green Olives; Milk-Braised Pork Loin with Hazelnuts and Pepper; and Royal Shoulder of Lamb with Saffron, Raisins and Pistachios. (Some recipes include nonbraised sides like Celery Root Salad.) There are also chapters on poultry and rabbit, seafood (e.g., Spiced Grouper with Fennel, Cashew and Mango; Sea Scallops with Salsify, Shiitake Mushrooms and White Miso), vegetables and beans, and even desserts, like the unexpected Sweet Eggplant with Pistachios. Headnotes give insight into the cultures that inspired these recipes&#x2014;all of which, as one would expect from Boulud, are intriguing and innovative&#x2014;and side notes on ingredients help make exotic dishes less intimidating. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But whoever this nameless woman was, and whatever befell her, is knowledge lost to another time. . . . <br><br>Boston, 1830: In order to pay for his education, Norris Marshall, a talented but penniless student at Boston Medical College, has joined the ranks of local &#x201c;resurrectionists&#x201d;&#x2013;those who plunder graveyards and harvest the dead for sale on the black market. Yet even this ghoulish commerce pales beside the shocking murder of a nurse found mutilated on the university hospital grounds. And when a distinguished doctor meets the same grisly fate, Norris finds that trafficking in the illicit cadaver trade has made him a prime suspect. <br><br>To prove his innocence, Norris must track down the only witness to have glimpsed the killer: Rose Connolly, a beautiful seamstress from the Boston slums who fears she may be the next victim. Joined by a sardonic, keenly intelligent young man named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Norris and Rose comb the city&#x2013;from its grim cemeteries and autopsy suites to its glittering mansions and centers of Brahmin power&#x2013;on the trail of a maniacal fiend who lurks where least expected . . . and who waits for his next lethal opportunity. <br><br>With unflagging suspense and pitch-perfect period detail, The Bone Garden deftly interweaves the thrilling narratives of its nineteenth- and twenty-first century protagonists, tracing the dark mystery at its heart across time and place to a finale as ingeniously conceived as it is shocking. Bold, bloody, and brilliant, this is Tess Gerritsen&#x2019;s finest achievement to date.<br><br>"An old mystery is crossed with a modern story in the latest from Gerritsen (<i>The Mephisto Club</i>, 2006, etc.).Julia Hamill, newly divorced and still smarting, purchases an old house outside Boston. Determined to dig a garden, she instead finds the bones of a long-dead woman&#x2013;the apparent victim of murder&#x2013;which starts her on a journey to ferret out the story behind her death. Julia connects with Henry, a no-nonsense 89-year-old with boxes of documents that once belonged to the now-deceased previous owner of Julia&#x2019;s home. The two discover a mystery dating back to the 1830s. At the heart of it is a baby named Meggie, born to the beautiful but doomed Irish chambermaid, Aurnia. Married to a man who cares nothing for her, Aurnia lays dying in a maternity ward with her sister, Rose, at her side. Rose, a spirited 17-year-old, takes Meggie to protect her from Aurnia&#x2019;s husband, but soon finds herself the target of a bizarre manhunt. Someone is after the child&#x2013;and Rose, as well, because she witnessed a horrifying murder. The body count piles up as Rose struggles to remain free of those who would take Meggie from her. Meanwhile, a young medical student becomes the chief suspect of the West End Reaper killings when he stumbles onto another terrible homicide. Although he fights the prospect, eventually he and Rose join forces to solve the murders and protect the baby at the heart of the mysterious deaths. Readers with delicate stomachs may find Gerritsen&#x2019;s graphic descriptions of corpse dissection hard to take, but the story, which digs up a dark Boston of times long past, entices readers to keep turning pages long after their bedtimes." <br>- <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred)</p><p>Tess Gerritsen is a physician and an internationally bestselling author.

Not with sweet whispers goodbye, not with the loving clasp of arthritic hands forty years from now, not with children and grandchildren grieving around her hospital bed. She lifted a scoop of earth and flung it aside, sending rocks clattering onto the growing mound. It was all clay and stones, good for growing nothing except blackberry canes. Barren soil, like her marriage, from which nothing long lasting, nothing worth holding on to, had sprouted.<br><br>She stamped down on the shovel and heard a clang, felt the concussion slam up her spine as the blade hit a rock&#x2014;a big one. She repositioned the blade, but even when she attacked the rock at different angles, she could not pry it loose. Demoralized and sweating in the heat, she stared down at the hole. All morning she had been digging like a woman possessed, and beneath her leather gloves blisters were peeled open. Julia&#x2019;s digging had stirred up a cloud of mosquitoes that whined around her face and infiltrated her hair.<br><br>There was no way around it: If she wanted to plant a garden in this spot, if she wanted to transform this weed-choked yard, she had to keep at it. This rock was in her way.<br><br>Suddenly the task seemed hopeless, beyond her puny efforts. She dropped the shovel and slumped to the ground, rump landing on the stony pile of dirt. Why had she ever thought she could restore this garden, salvage this house? She looked across the tangle of weeds and stared at the sagging porch, the weathered clapboards. Julia&#x2019;s Folly&#x2014; that&#x2019;s what she should name the place. Bought when she hadn&#x2019;t been thinking straight, when her life was collapsing. Why not add more flotsam to the wreckage? This was to be a consolation prize for surviving her divorce. At thirty-eight years old, Julia would finally have a house in her own name, a house with a past, a soul. When she had first walked through the rooms with the real estate agent, and had gazed at the hand-hewn beams, spied the bit of antique wallpaper peeking through a tear in the many layers that had since covered it, she&#x2019;d known this house was special. And it had called to her, asking for her help.<br><br>&#x201c;The location&#x2019;s unbeatable,&#x201d; the agent had said. &#x201c;It comes with nearly an acre of land, something you seldom find anymore this close to Boston.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why is it still for sale?&#x201d; Julia had asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You can see what bad shape it&#x2019;s in. When we first got the listing, there were boxes and boxes of books and old papers, stacked to the ceiling. It took a month for the heirs to haul it all away. Obviously, it needs bottom-up renovations, right down to the foundation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I like the fact that it has an interesting past. It wouldn&#x2019;t put me off buying it.&#x201d;<br><br>The agent hesitated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another issue I should tell you about. Full disclosure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What issue?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The previous owner was a woman in her nineties, and&#x2014;well, she died here. That makes some buyers a bit squeamish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In her nineties? Of natural causes, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the assumption.&#x201d;<br><br>Julia had frowned. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was summertime. And it took almost three weeks before one of her relatives discovered . . .&#x201d; The agent&#x2019;s voice trailed off. Suddenly she brightened. &#x201c;But hey, the land alone is special. You could tear down this whole place. Get rid of it and start fresh!&#x201d;<br><br>The way the world gets rid of old wives like me, Julia had thought. This splendid, dilapidated house and I both deserve better.<br><br>That same afternoon, Julia had signed the purchase agreement.<br><br>Now, as she slumped on the mound of dirt, slapping at mosquitoes, she thought: What did I get myself into? If Richard ever saw this wreck, it would only confirm what he already thought of her. Gullible Julia, putty in a Realtor&#x2019;s hands. Proud owner of a junk heap.<br><br>She swiped a hand over her eyes, smearing sweat across her cheek. Then she looked down at the hole again. How could she possibly expect to get her life in order when she couldn&#x2019;t even summon the strength to move one stupid rock?<br><br>She picked up a trowel and, leaning into the hole, began to scrape away dirt. More of the rock emerged, like an iceberg&#x2019;s tip whose hidden bulk she could only guess at. Maybe big enough to sink the Titanic. She kept digging, deeper and deeper, heedless of the mosquitoes and the sun glaring on her bare head. Suddenly the rock symbolized every obstacle, every challenge that she&#x2019;d ever wobbled away from.<br><br>I will not let you defeat me.<br><br>With the trowel, she hacked at the soil beneath the rock, trying to free up enough space to pry the shovel underneath it. Her hair slid into her face, strands clinging to sweaty skin as she reached deeper into the hole, scraping, tunneling. Before Richard saw this place, she&#x2019;d turn it into a paradise. She had two months before she&#x2019;d have to face another classroom of third graders. Two months to uproot these weeds, nourish the soil, put in roses. Richard had told her that if she ever planted roses in their Brookline yard, they&#x2019;d die on her. You need to know what you&#x2019;re doing, he&#x2019;d said&#x2014;just a casual remark, but it had stung nevertheless. She knew what he&#x2019;d really meant.<br><br>You need to know what you&#x2019;re doing. And you don&#x2019;t.<br><br>She dropped onto her belly and hacked away. Her trowel collided with something solid. Oh, God, not another rock. Shoving back her hair, she stared down at what her tool had just hit. Its metal tip had fractured a surface, and cracks radiated from the impact point. She brushed away dirt and pebbles, exposing an unnaturally smooth dome. Lying belly-down on the ground, she felt her heart thudding against the earth and suddenly found it hard to take a breath. But she kept digging, with both hands now, gloved fingers scraping through stubborn clay. More of the dome emerged, curves knitted together by a jagged seam. Deeper and deeper she clawed, her pulse accelerating as she uncovered a small dirt-filled hollow. She pulled off her glove and prodded the caked earth with a bare finger. Suddenly the dirt fractured and crumbled away.<br><br>Julia jerked back onto her knees and stared down at what she had just revealed. The mosquitoes&#x2019; whine built to a shriek, but she did not wave them away and was too numb to feel their stings. A breeze feathered the grass, stirring the sweet-syrup smell of Queen Anne&#x2019;s lace. Julia&#x2019;s gaze lifted to her weed-ridden property, a place she had hoped to transform into a paradise. She&#x2019;d imagined a vibrant garden of roses and peonies, an arbor twined with purple clematis. Now when she looked at this yard, she no longer saw a garden.<br><br>She saw a graveyard.<br><br>&#x201c;You could have asked for my advice before you bought this shack,&#x201d; said her sister, Vicky, sitting at Julia&#x2019;s kitchen table.<br><br>Julia stood at the window, staring out at the multiple mounds of dirt that had sprung up like baby volcanoes in her back garden. For the past three days, a crew from the medical examiner&#x2019;s office had practically camped out in her yard. She was now so accustomed to having them tramp in and out of her house to use the toilet that she&#x2019;d miss having them around when the excavation was done, and they finally left her alone again, here in this house with its hand-hewn beams and its history. And its ghosts.<br><br>Outside, the medical examiner, Dr. Isles, had just arrived and was crossing toward the excavation site. Julia thought her an unsettling sort of woman, neither friendly nor unfriendly, with ghostly pale skin and Goth-black hair. She looks so calm and collected, Julia thought, watching Isles through the window.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like you to just jump into something,&#x201d; said Vicky. &#x201c;An offer on the first day you saw it? Did you think anyone else would snatch it up?&#x201d; She pointed to the crooked cellar door. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t even shut. Did you check the foundation? This place has got to be a hundred years old.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hundred and thirty,&#x201d; Julia murmured, her gaze still on the backyard, where Dr. Isles stood at the edge of the excavation hole.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, honey,&#x201d; Vicky said, her voice softening. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s been a tough year for you. I know what you&#x2019;re going through. I just wish you&#x2019;d called me before you did something this drastic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not such a bad property,&#x201d; Julia insisted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s got an acre of land. It&#x2019;s close to the city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s got a dead body in the backyard. That&#x2019;ll really help its resale value.&#x201d;<br><br>Julia massaged her neck, which was suddenly knotted with tension. Vicky was right. Vicky was always right. Julia thought: I&#x2019;ve poured my bank account into this house, and now I&#x2019;m the proud owner of a cursed property. Through the window, she saw another newcomer arrive on the scene. It was an older woman with short gray hair, dressed in blue jeans and heavy work boots&#x2014;not the sort of outfit one expected for such a grandmotherly type. Yet one more queer character wandering through her yard today. Who were these people, converging on the dead? Why did they choose such a profession, confronting every day what most people shuddered to even contemplate?<br><br>&#x201c;Did you talk to Richard before you bought it?&#x201d;<br><br>Julia went still. &#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t talk to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you heard from him at all lately?&#x201d; Vicky asked. The change in her voice&#x2014;suddenly quiet, almost hesitant&#x2014;made Julia at last turn to look at her sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you asking?&#x201d; said Julia.<br><br>&#x201c;You were married to him. Don&#x2019;t you...</p><h2>Soldier of the Mist</h2><p>Latro, a mercenary soldier from the north, has suffered a head wound in battle but has developed the ability to see and converse with all of the invisible gods, goddesses, ghosts, demons, and werewolves that inhabit the land</p><p>A science fiction/ fantasy master presents the story of Latro, an ancient Greek soldier, who has suffered a head wound. Because he cannot remember from day to day, Latro describes events in a scroll. His senses, intensified by his injury, enable him to see many things, including gods circulating among mortals. Verna delivers a full-voiced narration with subtle vocal characterizations. His voice is a gentle baritone, slightly higher for a young girl, slowed into oiliness for the snake god.

The city had been dumping sewage into it for generations, coating the seafloor with a layer of &#x201c;black mayonnaise.&#x201d; Fisheries collapsed, wildlife fled, and locals referred to floating tampon applicators as &#x201c;beach whistles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the 1990s, work began on a state-of-the-art treatment plant and a 10-mile-long tunnel&#x2014;its endpoint stretching farther from civilization than the earth&#x2019;s deepest ocean trench&#x2014;to carry waste out of the harbor. With this impressive feat of engineering, Boston was poised to show the country how to rebound from environmental ruin. But when bad decisions and clashing corporations endangered the project, a team of commercial divers was sent on a perilous mission to rescue the stymied cleanup effort.&nbsp;Five divers went in; not all of them came out alive. <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents collected over five years of reporting, award-winning writer Neil Swidey takes us deep into the lives of the divers, engineers, politicians, lawyers, and investigators involved in the tragedy and its aftermath, creating a taut, action-packed narrative. The climax comes just after the hard-partying DJ Gillis and his friend Billy Juse trade assignments as they head into the tunnel, sentencing one of them to death. <br> &nbsp;<br> An intimate portrait of the wreckage left in the wake of lives lost, the book&#x2014;which Dennis Lehane calls "extraordinary" and compares with <i>The Perfect Storm&#x2014;</i>is also a morality tale. What is the true cost of these large-scale construction projects, as designers and builders, emboldened by new technology and pressured to address a growing population&#x2019;s rapacious needs, push the limits of the possible? This is a story about human risk&#x2014;how it is calculated, discounted, and transferred&#x2014;and the institutional failures that can lead to catastrophe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suspenseful yet humane, <i>Trapped Under the Sea</i> reminds us that behind every bridge, tower, and tunnel&#x2014;behind the infrastructure that makes modern life possible&#x2014;lies unsung bravery and extraordinary sacrifice.</p><p><b>Neil Swidey</b> is the author of <i>The Assist</i>, a <i>Boston Globe</i> bestseller that was named one of the<i>&nbsp;</i>best books of the year by the Washington Post, and coauthor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Last Lion: The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy</i>.

Straight ahead was a sun-tanned brunette washing her car while wearing ripped jean shorts and a wet half-shirt. As he trained his eyes on her, DJ could practically hear the thumping hair-metal-band soundtrack playing in his head. Actually, it wasn't all in his head. There was music coming from around the back of the house, where someone had placed a speaker facing out of a first-floor window.<br><br>At a picnic table, three attractive women in their early twenties sat in Daisy Duke cutoffs and tight tops, drinking wine coolers and taking in the sun on a late summer afternoon. It was a Friday in August 1993, and DJ, a month shy of his twenty-fourth birthday, had just returned to Massachusetts after more than two years working as an offshore diver in the Gulf of Mexico. During his time away, his mother and younger brother had moved into the upstairs apartment of this two-family house in Waltham, a former mill city west of Boston. They were away on vacation now, so DJ was on his own as he saw the new place for the first time.<br><br>A guy around his age approached him, explaining that he lived in the downstairs apartment with his girlfriend, the dark-haired car washer. He invited DJ to grab a beer and join the party that was just getting started. DJ didn't need much convincing and plopped himself down at the picnic table. Given his muscular build, broad smile, and easy conversational skills, he never had much trouble getting noticed by girls, even if he was shier than he let on.<br><br>A blonde named Lisa, in between drags on her cigarette, began chatting him up. She had a big laugh to match a big personality. When she told a story, she used her chin, not just her hands, for emphasis. DJ immediately liked her. But his eyes were more drawn to the black-haired woman sitting next to her, who introduced herself as Donna. At least that's what it sounded like to DJ's ears. But when he called her that a few minutes later, she quickly corrected him. It may have sounded like Donna, but her name was actually spelled Dana. To nail the correct pronunciation--DAH-nah--you needed to contort your mouth into a horizontal line as exaggerated as a mailbox slot. Seems like a lot of trouble for a name, DJ thought to himself. But he was so smitten that he didn't mind. Dana had bronze skin, big alluring eyes, and milky teeth that lit up her face when she smiled.<br><br>DJ could sense that all the girls were fascinated by his tales of adventure as a diver in the Gulf. He explained how he would get helicoptered way out to sea, onto a giant oil platform the size of a village, so he could do complicated work hundreds of feet underwater. When he'd left Waltham a few years earlier, he'd been just another construction worker hanging out at the bar. Now, having turned his childhood love of the water into a thrilling career, he could claim a deep well of true stories. He knew to prune from his anecdotes all the unglamorous realities of life as an offshore diver--the smelly sleeping quarters and grunt work bordering on hazing--and stick to the exciting stuff.<br><br>The party grew as the night wore on. When DJ noticed at one point that Dana had disappeared, he turned his attention to blond-haired Lisa. As night turned to morning, they made their way upstairs to his mother's apartment, where they hooked up. She took off early the next morning, explaining that she had to head out of town.<br><br>It didn't take long for day two of the party to get going. Once again Dana was there, and this time DJ didn't let her out of his sight. She told him she was a hairstylist at a high-end Boston salon. She clearly liked to have a good time, but DJ detected something classy and almost exotic about her, with her dark hair falling around her face, hiding one of her eyes.<br><br>Late that night, after most of the partyers had cleared out, DJ realized he had lost the key to his mother's apartment. "Don't worry," his downstairs neighbor told him. "You can crash on our couch."<br><br>Things heated up between DJ and Dana once they found themselves alone. Eventually they moved from the couch to the dark kitchen and then, for the crescendo, onto the kitchen counter. Suddenly someone flicked on the overhead light. Dana yelled. DJ turned to see a groggy guy who was clearly startled to find he had produced such drama--or more accurately, interrupted it. That was all the motivation DJ needed to head outside, climb up to the second floor, and crawl through a window. He then let Dana in, and they spent the night together with no further interruptions.<br><br>Even as the fun began to wind down on Sunday, DJ had something else to look forward to. While he had been working as a nonunion diver in the Gulf, his hope in returning to Boston was to join Local 56, the union for pile drivers and commercial divers. The pay and benefits were a lot better for union divers, which is why DJ worried it would be hard to break into the local. But just a few days earlier, he'd received instructions from the union hall to show up at the beginning of the week for a job rebuilding a ship terminal in South Boston. In one weekend, everything in his personal and professional life seemed to come together.<br><br>Late that afternoon Dana made a call. After she hung up, she mentioned her sister would be coming over.<br><br>"Oh," DJ said. "You got a sister?"<br><br>"Yes," Dana replied, tilting her head in surprise. "You met her."<br><br>DJ racked his brain but couldn't recall meeting her sister. Dana insisted. "You know, Lisa--the blond girl."<br><br>The words were a punch to his gut. When Lisa arrived, DJ noticed her flinch as she saw Dana caressing his arm. DJ tried the only move he could think of, a last-minute call for clemency in the form of a pained look shot directly at Lisa. With it, he was wordlessly saying: I had no idea.<br><br>Lisa, to his eternal relief, returned a forgiving look.<br><br>Later, when her sister was out of the room, Lisa said to him, "I see you and Dana are getting along well."<br><br>"Yeah," DJ replied nervously. "Listen, Lisa, I didn't know--"<br><br>She cut him off. "You don't have to explain anything. I can tell you didn't know we were sisters."<br><br>DJ couldn't have been more relieved. He was attracted to Dana in a way he hadn't felt before, though there were few signs of the role she would come to play in his life.<br><br>There was, however, more fallout from his fantasy weekend. All that partying caught up with him to the point where, on his first day of his first union job, he showed up to the worksite late. The supervisor told DJ that if he thought he could just waltz in whenever he felt like it, he should save everybody some time and go find another job. "Don't even think about being late again," the guy barked, "unless you've got a really good story."<br><br>DJ flashed an impish grin. "Have I got a story for you!" he said, launching into the tale of his weekend with two sisters. By the end, the supervisor was the one grinning. He let DJ's tardiness slide.<br>DJ didn't get into it then, but his full life story was just as interesting.<br><br>As a kid, he'd lived in eleven states in a dozen years. Tennessee, Maryland, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma. He was forever the new kid, the outsider who would never be around long enough to make real friends. In every new town, he carried an unfamiliar accent with inflections from the last stop, setting him up for taunting from the other kids.<br><br>His mother, Lorraine, had grown up on a farm near the rocky coastline of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. Her father regularly traveled to the States to find work as a carpenter, and at age twenty-one, Lorraine had followed him. In Boston she fell for an Irish construction worker, got pregnant, and eventually gave birth to a boy she named Donald James Gillis, after her two brothers. Soon everyone took to calling him DJ.<br><br>After a few years raising DJ alone, Lorraine married a pipe fitter who helped build power plants, specializing in nuclear facilities. She had a son with him, and as he chased work across the country, she followed along with her two young boys. She was fond of her husband but felt that his weakness for alcohol made life a struggle. When he drank his wages, Lorraine had to provide for her sons with the small paychecks she earned working in a series of service jobs: waitress, hospital worker, clerk at a fireworks stand.<br><br>In this sea of uncertainty, Lorraine came to rely heavily on DJ. Even as a young boy, he had shown himself to be cool in a crisis. When he was eight years old, he appeared at their Oklahoma door carrying his bloodied five-year-old brother, David. DJ was holding a towel down on his brother's forehead and squeezing his hand tightly. Lorraine shrieked. "Oh my God! What happened?"<br><br>But DJ's first words to his mother were reassuring. "Don't be scared, Mom. He's gonna be okay."<br><br>A neighborhood punk had thrown a piece of pipe at DJ's brother, producing an enormous gash in his head. DJ had carried David several blocks home, like a firefighter calmly removing a child from a house in flames. "From that day on," Lorraine would later say, "DJ was like a father, constantly protecting his brother--and me."<br><br>When Lorraine finally tried to steel herself to leave her husband, DJ was the one she confided in. "Don't be scared, Mom," he told her. "You're tough. We can make it together." She drew strength from those words, even though they came from the mouth of a twelve-year-old boy.<br><br>After bouncing around for a few years, Lorraine and her sons landed back in the Boston area in 1984, on DJ's fifteenth birthday. They arrived in Newton, a small city bordering Boston, and settled into a gloomy, almost petrified house with plastic-encased sofas. It was owned by an invalid woman whom Lorraine would care for in exchange for housing. Newton was an affluent, education-obsessed city, so the transition was not easy for DJ, a high school freshman with a spotty transcript. Kids made fun of his cowboy boots and curious southern accent. They called him a redneck, a dagger of an insult if there ever was one in such a brainy town. When he visited classmates' homes, he found a degree of wealth that would have been inconceivable in the sticks of Tennessee and Oklahoma. It made him only more embarrassed about his borrowed space in an old lady's dusty house.<br><br>By his sophomore year, his family had moved to the neighboring city of Waltham, whose complexion turned quickly from gritty industry and tired triple-deckers to sleek high-tech offices and green suburbia. When he attended his first teen house party, he found himself being stared down by one of the toughest kids in school, a beefy pot dealer. DJ was tall but at that point very thin, so everyone expected him to get pummeled. Yet all those years moving around and constantly having to defend himself had turned him into an agile fighter. He ended up throwing the pot dealer through a window. After that, no one made fun of DJ's accent anymore.<br><br>Before long he was getting into so many fistfights that his guidance counselor called him into his office and asked, "Is everything all right at home?" He figured DJ's string of black eyes and busted lips were signs of abuse, not the emblems of his new identity as someone who was both cool and fearless.<br><br>The next year he transferred to the city's vocational high school, where he discovered a talent for welding. Before long, he picked up a part-time job with a local welder. After graduating from high school, his mother helped him buy a brand-new black Firebird Formula 350. He treasured that car, keeping it immaculate. He cruised the downtown strip with pride, as though his Firebird were announcing to the world the arrival of the kid who had always been ashamed of how little he had.<br><br>A life of the party who seemed just dangerous enough to be attractive, DJ had become a guy that girls wanted a piece of and other guys wanted to be around. He cemented his appeal by adding muscle to his build through weight lifting. After a lonely and turbulent childhood, he savored the newfound attention. He moved quickly and partied vigorously, making up for lost time.<br><br>Still, for all the fun he was having, DJ realized that on some level he was lost. He had struggled just to get through high school, so college didn't seem viable. He worked several blue-collar jobs but couldn't glimpse much of a future. When a relative offered him the chance to work with him doing commercial construction in Syracuse, New York, DJ said yes.<br><br>Cut off from their normal social circles, they filled some of their downtime taking scuba-diving lessons at a local pool. As a kid, DJ had always loved swimming, refusing to get out of the water until he had reached that blue-lipped, body-shivering state that only children and shipwreck victims seem able to tolerate. Before one class, as he flipped through a scuba magazine, he came across an article describing commercial diving as a career. It explained how these divers did underwater welding and construction and traveled the world, finding adventure and making good money. It dawned on DJ: This is something I could be good at.<br><br>In February 1991, twenty-one-year-old DJ moved to Houston to enroll at the Ocean Corporation dive school. After a month in school, around the time when many wannabe divers realize how punishing the job is and quit, DJ called home to Lorraine.<br><br>"Mom," he said, "this is exactly what I want to be doing."<br>DJ grabbed his yellow fiberglass diving helmet out of his truck and headed over to the job site. The SuperLite 17 was his prized possession. He'd bought it used, when he was just getting started in the Gulf, and even then it had set him back nearly three grand. Despite its name, the helmet still weighed about thirty pounds out of the water. This job in the fall of 1993 had brought DJ to a hydroelectric plant in southeastern Vermont. Given his experience as a deep-sea diver in the Gulf, where he'd done underwater welding at depths of 250 feet, he figured working in the waters of a New England river one-tenth as deep would be like a dip in the pool.</p><h2>Infinity and the Mind</h2><p>An examination of the mathematical, physical, and philosophical aspects of infinity includes discussions of set theory, the theorems of the mathematician, Kurt Godel, and the concepts of space and time</p><p><p>"<i>Infinity and the Mind</i> can be read and enjoyed by experts and nonexperts alike.

W. Dupee praised his &#x201c;whim of iron&#x201d; and &#x201c;cleverness amounting to genius,&#x201d; while Beerbohm himself noted that &#x201c;only the insane take themselves quite seriously.&#x201d; From his precocious debut as a dandy in 1890s Oxford until he put his pen aside in the aftermath of World War II, Beerbohm was recognized as an incomparable observer of modern life and an essayist whose voice was always and only his own. Here Phillip Lopate, one of the finest essayists of our day, has selected the finest of Beerbohm&#x2019;s essays. Whether writing about the vogue for Russian writers, laughter and philosophy, dandies, or George Bernard Shaw, Beerbohm is as unpredictable as he is unfailingly witty and wise. As Lopate writes, &#x201c;Today . . . it becomes all the more necessary to ponder how Beerbohm performed the delicate operation of displaying so much personality without lapsing into sticky confession.&#x201d;</p><p><p><b>Max Beerbohm</b> (1872&#x2013;1956) was born in London and studied at Oxford. He published his first collection of essays, <i>The Works of Max Beerbohm</i>, in 1896 and soon developed a reputation as a brilliant caricaturist and critic. He was married to the American actress Florence Kahn and lived in Rapallo, Italy, for most of his later life. In addition to <i>The Prince of Minor Writers</i>, NYRB Classics publishes Beerbohm&#x2019;s <i>Seven Men</i>, a short-story collection.<br><b> Phillip Lopate</b> is the author of the essay collections <i>Against Joie de Vivre</i>, <i>Bachelorhood</i>, <i>Being with Children</i>, <i>Portrait of My Body</i>, and <i>Totally, Tenderly, Tragically</i>; and of the novels <i>The Rug Merchant</i> and <i>Confessions of a Summer</i>.

Looking for the space and freedom to live out their lives as they pleased, they were welcomed as kindred souls by the ghost town's few residents. A tad eccentric, they quickly ingratiated themselves into the tiny frontier community through Papa's charisma, their apparent dedication to self-reliance, and occasional family performances of their unique blend of gospel and bluegrass, music that seemed to soar on the conviction of their beliefs. And when they purchased an old mining claim in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park with plans to permanently settle there (dubbing it &#x201c;Hillbilly Heaven&#x201d;), it seemed the Pilgrim family had come home to the last existing place in America that suited them.</p> <p>But Hale chafed against the regulations that came with being a National Park inholder, and he quickly adopted an adversarial stance with the NPS, refusing to communicate with or even acknowledge its rangers. Everything went sideways when he bulldozed a road to town across national park lands, stopping just short of McCarthy in an attempt to avoid scrutiny. It didn't work. When the road was discovered by backpackers, NPS agents were fast on the scene and all over the Pilgrims' activities, and suddenly the humble hermit became a lightning rod for property-rights activists in McCarthy, Alaska, and far beyond.</p> <p>That's where Tom Kizzia entered the story. As a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News, he wrote a series of lengthy articles on the family's struggle with the federal government, and he soon discovered that Papa's past belied the tales he told about himself and his clan. This simple man of faith carried a long, strange, and troubled history: the violent death of his first wife, whom he married when she was 16, and who also happened to be the daughter of Texas governor John Connally; his hippie phase (when he went by the name "Sunstar"), filled with drug-fueled epiphanies and raging outbursts; a contentious relationship with his neighbors in the New Mexico wilderness, who accused Hale of casual disregard for laws that didn't suit his interests (especially the ones related to "Thou shalt not steal"); and worst of all, a dominion over his children that hinted at the most vile forms of abuse. As the situation with the NPS degraded and grew more tense, Hale's behavior became more erratic, driving himself and the entire town toward a denouement reminiscent of <em>Night of the Hunter</em> and Robert Mitchum&#x2019;s own creepy and deranged (if fictional) preacher.</p> <p>With <em>Pilgrim's Wilderness</em>, Kizzia has expanded on his original reporting and written a spellbinding tale of narcissism and religious mania's concussive effects on Hale's family and adopted town, a book that's likely to end up on many 2013 Best Of lists.<em>--Jon Foro</em></p> <p><b>Sample images from <em>Pilgrim's Wilderness</em></b></p> <em> </em> The ghost town of McCarthy in the winter of 1983,<br> the year six residents died in a mass murder on mail<br> plane day.

S. Lewis&#39;s Journey to Faith</h2><p>Other biographies of Lewis explore his childhood or his dramatic conversion to Christianity. But it was the rarely discussed period from Lewis&#39;s childhood to his early thirties that took him on a tumultuous journey of spiritual and intellectual exploration before he became the &#34;most reluctant convert.&#34; It was not despite this journey but precisely because of it that Lewis understood the search for life&#39;s ultimate meaning so well and went on to become one of the most compelling authors of the twentieth century. Weaving the people, places and events of Lewis&#39;s life together with excerpts from Lewis&#39;s own writing, this book reveals how Lewis&#39;s spiritual quest can cast light on the path for other pilgrims.</p><p>David C. Downing is the Ralph W. Schlosser Professor of English at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.A C.S. Lewis scholar and professor of English, Downing offers a thoughtful examination of the great man's journey from disbelief to eloquent proponent of Christianity. The cultural and religious climate in his native Northern Ireland, his childhood and boarding school experiences, and the loss of his mother at age 9 all affected Lewis emotionally and complicated his ability to settle into a religious faith. Filled with interesting detail about the intellectual and spiritual communities that surrounded Lewis, the analysis is impressive without sounding academic or intellectual. A degree of suspense pervades the narrative as Lewis bobs and weaves around his conflicts, eventually finding his life's passion and purpose.

It is not clear what the intended audience for this attractive book is. The bright, intriguing pictures and easy beginning will entice preschoolers, but even with an adult's help, few of them could make it all the way through this book. Most third graders could read the directions for themselves, but are likely to find some parts too easy, others too hard to tackle alone, and the ``Few Notes for Parents, Teachers, and Other Older Readers'' is disappointingly full of philosophy and chary of ``right'' answers. Perhaps teachers could best use Anno's Math Games to supplement math texts. The section on measuring and proportions is especially valuable. Unlike most math games and puzzles, these are not concerned with numbers at all. Instead of numbers, Anno uses pictures; instead of equations, he works toward an intuitive feeling for what sort of answers are required.

But she soon encountered the jarring realities of life in one of the poorest counties in America, still disabled by the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. In this stirring memoir, Kuo, the child of Taiwanese immigrants, shares the story of her complicated but rewarding mentorship of one student, Patrick Browning, and his remarkable literary and personal awakening. </p> <p> Convinced she can make a difference in the lives of her teenaged students, Michelle Kuo puts her heart into her work, using quiet reading time and guided writing to foster a sense of self in students left behind by a broken school system. Though Michelle loses some students to truancy and even gun violence, she is inspired by some such as Patrick. Fifteen and in the eighth grade, Patrick begins to thrive under Michelle&#x2019;s exacting attention. However, after two years of teaching, Michelle feels pressure from her parents and the draw of opportunities outside the Delta and leaves Arkansas to attend law school. </p> <p> Then, on the eve of her law-school graduation, Michelle learns that Patrick has been jailed for murder. Feeling that she left the Delta prematurely and determined to fix her mistake, Michelle returns to Helena and resumes Patrick&#x2019;s education&#x2014;even as he sits in a jail cell awaiting trial. Every day for the next seven months they pore over classic novels, poems, and works of history. Little by little, Patrick grows into a confident, expressive writer and a dedicated reader galvanized by the works of Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Walt Whitman, W. S. Merwin, and others. In her time reading with Patrick, Michelle is herself transformed, contending with the legacy of racism and the questions of what constitutes a&nbsp;&#x201c;good&#x201d; life and what the privileged owe to those with bleaker prospects. </p></p><p>"An absorbing, tender, and surprisingly honest examination of race and privilege in America." - Wes Moore, author of <i>The Other Wes Moore&nbsp;</i><i></i><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>"Every American should read Michelle Kuo's remarkable memoir, a defining story for our times and, abidingly, a testament to the power of language and of books." - Claire Messud, author of <i>The Burning Girl </i>and <i>The Woman Upstairs&nbsp;</i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>&nbsp;</i>"A reminder of how literacy changes lives.

It had opened its pale petals on a twig of the bough that curls and twists up to my windowsill. This morning, the blossom is gone; the paleness upon the twig is snow. It does one no good, in these hills, to set store by the earth&#x2019;s steady warming.</i></p><p><i>My body is as bent as that bough. The cold is an ache in my bones. I am sure that this year&#x2019;s reaping will be the last that I see. I hope only for one more season of summer fruit, for the ease of the hot sun on my back, for ripe figs, warm from the tree, spilling their sweet nectar through these splayed fingers. I have come to love this plain house, here among the groves. I have laid my head down in many places&#x2014;on greasy sheepskins at the edge of battlefields, under the black expanse of goat hair tents, on the cold stone of caves and on the scented linens of palaces. But this is the only home that has been my own.</i></p><p><i>They are at work, already, on Har Moriah. From across the wadi, I can hear the thin squeal of the planes scraping upon the logs. Hard work to get these trees here; felled in the forests of the Lebanon, lashed together into rafts, floated south on the sea, dragged up from the coast by oxen. Now the tang of cut cedar perfumes the air. Soon, the king will come, as he does every morning, to inspect the progress of the work. I know when he arrives by the cheers of the men. Even conscripted workers and slaves call out in praise of him, because he treats them fairly and honors their skill.</i></p><p><i>I close my eyes, and imagine how it will be, when the walls have risen from the foundations of dressed stone: the vast pillars carved with lilies and pomegranates, sunlight glinting on cladding of gold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p><i>It is the only way I will ever see it: these pictures in my mind&#x2019;s eye. I will not live to make the ascent up the broad stairs, to stand within the gilded precincts as the scent of burning fat and incense rises to the sky. It is well. I would not wish to go without him. I thought, at one time, that we would go together. I can still see his eyes, bright with the joy of creation, as he chose and planned what materials, what embellishments, pacing the floor, throwing his arms up and shaping the pillars as he envisioned them, his long fingers carving the air. But that was before I had to tell him that he would never build the temple. Before I had to tell him that all his killing&#x2014;the very blood that, one might say, slakes the mortar of those foundation stones&#x2014;had stained him too deeply. Strange words, you might think, to come from the selfsame source that had required these killings of him.</i></p><p><i>Hard words, like blows. The blast from heaven, issuing from my mouth. Words born of thoughts I had not had, delivered with anger I did not feel, spilling out in a voice I did not even know for my own. Words whose reason no human heart could fathom. Civilization is built upon the backs of men like him, whose blood and sweat make it possible. But comes the peace, and the civil world has scant place for such men. It fell to me to tell him so.</i></p><p><i>And like all such words that have formed upon my lips, these have become true in fact. It has come to be just as the voice said it would: this one dear ambition denied him. A bequest, instead, to his heir.</i></p><p><i>In this, I am more fortunate than he. I have lived to complete my life&#x2019;s great work. I have rolled and tied the scrolls with my own hands, sealed them with wax, secured them in clay vessels, and seen to their placement in the high, dry caves where I played as a child. In the nights, which have become so long for me, I think of those scrolls, and I feel a measure of peace. I remember it all so clearly, that day, at the turn of the year, the month when kings go out to battle. How warily I broached the matter. It might seem odd to say so, as my whole life in his service had been bent to this purpose: the speaking of truth, welcome or no. But it is one thing to transmit the divine through a blasting storm of holy noise, another thing entirely to write a history forged from human voices, imperfect memories, self-interested accounts.</i></p><p><i>I have set it all down, first and last, the light and the dark. Because of my work, he will live. And not just as a legend lives, a safe tale for the fireside, fit for the ears of the young. Nothing about him ever was safe. Because of me, he will live in death as he did in life: a man who dwelt in the searing glance of the divine, but who sweated and stank, rutted without restraint, butchered the innocent, betrayed those most loyal to him. Who loved hugely, and was kind; who listened to brutal truth and honored the truth teller; who flayed himself for his wrongdoing; who built a nation, made music that pleased heaven and left poems in our mouths that will be spoken by people yet unborn.</i></p><p><i>I have had a great length of days, and been many things. A reluctant warrior. A servant, a counselor. Sometimes, perhaps, his friend. And this, also, have I been: a hollow reed through which the breath of truth sounded its discordant notes.</i></p><p><i>Words. Words upon the wind. What will endure, perhaps, is what I have written. If so, it is enough.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I</p><p>A man alone in a room. Not such an extraordinary thing. Yet as I stepped into the chamber I had a sense of something out of place. My eye traveled around the space, the woven pillows, the low tables set with sweating ewers of cool water&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all was in order, yet something was not right. Then I grasped it. It had been a while since I had found him in a room by himself. For a long time, it seemed, he had moved in a press of people: members of his household, the men of his army, his sons, servants, sycophants.</p><p>He stood by the open window, his back to me. From my place by the door I could not see what he saw, but the sounds made plain enough what held his gaze: the snap of banners in the breeze, the stamp of hooves, the wince and grind of iron on stone. And woven among these, like a bright thread through homespun, the sudden excited shouts of little boys. For them, born in the years of victory, muster for war was cause for uncomplicated joy. I knew that giddy thrill. I had been such a boy myself, once. When he, little more than a youth, led the band that sacked my village.</p><p>His fists, balled tight, were planted on the wide sill of the window embrasure, his arms encircled by polished copper cuffs. His hair, the same color as the copper, was undressed, and fell in a dense mane against the fine black wool of his mantle. The cuffs glinted in the low slant of early light as his arm muscles flexed. He was clenched from head to foot.</p><p>I am not a coward. Being in his service does not allow for it. My life, at certain times, has required me to draw upon deep wells of courage, and I am glad to say that I have never yet come up dry. But as I have resolved to set down a full account here, so I must begin with an honest accounting of myself. That morning, I was afraid. I had been summoned from my bed when it was still full dark, and though my slave, when he called me, had thought to bring a tray of warm bread fresh from the ovens, I had not touched it. Now, my empty stomach churned. Sound carries, at that hour, and as I waited in the anteroom, even the heavy cedar door could not muffle the angry voices within.</p><p>When Yoav exited the room, he burst through the door so abruptly that the young guard barely had time to come to attention, the butt of his spear striking the stone floor a few seconds after his general had already swept past him. Yoav&#x2019;s lips were drawn thin as a sheet of linen, his skin as pallid. He paused for a moment, fiddling with a strap on his greaves. His hand, which I saw was trembling slightly, could not manage the buckle. I have known Yoav since I was a child and he a youth thinking to kill me. I have seen him outnumbered on the battlefield and watched him run a man through at close quarters. I have seen him stand accused of murder, awaiting a death sentence. But never before had I seen his hand shake. He saw that I noticed, and he scowled. &#x201c;Go in,&#x201d; he said tersely. &#x201c;He wants you.&#x201d; Then, as I edged past him: &#x201c;Take care. He is in a rage. His mood is foul.&#x201d;</p><p>The guard opened the door for me, looking to neither right nor left as I passed from the anteroom to the inner chamber. I stood, just inside, waiting for acknowledgment. After a time, unsure if he knew that I was there, I cleared my throat. Still he did not turn. I held myself motionless, my gaze on the yellow shaft of sunlight widening upon the flagstones. Although it was early, the room was warming. Soon enough, it would be hot. I felt a bead of sweat forming on my brow.</p><p>Suddenly, he opened his fists, reached for the shutters, and slammed them shut. He turned, his light mantle swinging. I, who had served him for years, was used to that face, its grave beauty, the bright glance that could kindle love or fear. But the expression was not the one I had expected. Yoav was son of the king&#x2019;s older sister; they had become men together. He knew David as well as anyone alive. Yoav had said anger, and anger was there, but I could tell he had not read his uncle in full. Anger was there, but not anger only. The tense set of David&#x2019;s body showed will at work, containing wrath, but also grief. The glint in his eye was, I believe, a tear.</p><p>&#x201c;What is the profit of being an anointed king, Natan, if I am to be confined here like a prisoner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your generals act only out of love for you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>His hand spliced the air. &#x201c;They act out of fear.&#x201d; He had never been a man for platitude. &#x201c;Love?&#x201d; He spat the word. &#x201c;There is no love in this. This is fear and mistrust. And for what? The lapse of a moment, merely. How many wars have we made together? You have been at my side, time and again, when we fought the Plishtim. You were with me in the south when we crushed the Moavites, and in the north against the Arameans. And you know well&#x2014;who better?&#x2014;I was a warrior for years before that. In all those battles, when did I ever flinch? Tell me. Tell me a time I faltered.&#x201d; The voice had steadied now, and was rising.</p><p>That voice. So familiar to me. So familiar to all of us. <i>The sweet singer of Israel.</i> So the people called him, long before he was king. I had heard that singer&#x2019;s voice fill a hall, and bring tears to the cheeks of seasoned warriors. But I had heard it also on the battlefield, fierce and wild, carrying over the clash of arms and the cries of the dying.</p><p>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; I answered him. This was not flattery, but unburnished truth. In my mind, the visions crowded, one layered upon the other, each of them with the unnatural vividness of memories forged at moments when one&#x2019;s life is at risk. I could see bright hair flying from beneath the iron helmet as he sprinted before us into a clatter of arrows, the faceted muscles of his calves as he led the swarm up a siege ladder, the sinews of his back, taut with the strain of the pulled bow as he braced himself in the <i>merkava.</i> Every memory I had of him was a view from behind. Simply because, at the deadly moment, he was always in the forefront.</p><p>I had been trailing after him, as ever, at the end of that most recent campaign, of which he now spoke. We had been fighting for more than a week, the advantage now theirs, now ours. The day was hot, windless. The air was thick with lingering smoke from the night&#x2019;s death pyres, still smoldering. The stench of charred bone met the stink of rot and vomit, shit and sweat. I have never loved war, as some men love it. I have fought of necessity, as has every man my age with two legs, two arms and wit enough to follow a simple order. It is what the times, and the Land, have required of us.</p><p>It was nearing sunset on the eighth day. We&#x2019;d fought since dawn. I had reached that point beyond exhaustion, where every muscle quivers and my mind could not hold a thought beyond the next step, and the one after, the next breath, and the one after. We went forward through sheer will&#x2014;his will, that force that could goad a man to do what was beyond him. Finally, in the long shadows of the late afternoon, the Plishtim began to fall back from the plain. Their retreat was toward the foothills. Another general would have let them go and been glad of it. But he saw that if they secured that high ground they might regroup and come at us again, this time with their archers positioned to advantage. So he called us to ranks with a curdling cry. I glimpsed his face through the crowd of men. It was bloodied, dirt-streaked, avid. Then he turned, fist to the sky, and sprinted. He set the pace for the fleetest of his runners, youths who could give him a decade. Even uphill, he seemed to fly over the loose stones that slid out from underfoot and left me skidding and swearing.</p><p>I fell behind, and lost sight of him. Others&#x2014;younger men, better fighters&#x2014;overtook me, swarming to him, compelled by his courage. When I finally glimpsed him again, he was above me on a long, slender ridge, in the thick of fierce fighting. Trying to narrow the distance between us, I lost my footing entirely on the uncertain ground. I slipped. Metal, leather and flesh scraped against rough limestone that bit like snaggleteeth. I could not control my fall until I planted my foot into something that gave softly under my weight. The man had been attempting to crawl away, dragging himself with his remaining hand while a slime of blood pulsed from the stump of his sword arm. My boot, mashing his neck flat into stone, had put an end to that. When I lifted my foot, the man gave a wet gargle, and was still. I scraped the mess off my boot onto the nearest rock and went on.</p><p>When I reached the ridge, the king was making an end of another fighter. He was up close, eye to eye. His sword had entered just above the man&#x2019;s groin. He drew it upward, in a long, slow, arcing slash. As he pulled the blade back&#x2014;slick, dripping&#x2014;long tubes of bowel came tumbling after. I could see the dying man&#x2019;s eyes, wide with horror, his hands gripping for his guts, trying to push them back into the gaping hole in his belly. The king&#x2019;s own eyes were blank&#x2014;all the warmth swallowed by the black stain of widening pupils. David reached out an arm and pushed the man hard in the chest. He fell backward off the narrow ledge and rolled down the slope, his entrails unfurling after him like a glossy ribband.</p><p>I was engaged myself then, by a bullnecked spearman who required all my flagging strength. He was bigger than me, but clumsy, and I used his size against him, so that as I feinted one way, he lunged with his spear, overbalanced and fell right onto the dagger that I held close and short at my side. I felt the metal grating against the bone of his rib, and then I mustered enough force to thrust the tip sharply upward, the blade&#x2019;s full length inside him, in the direction of his heart. I felt the warm wetness of his insides closing about my fist. It was intimate as a rape.</p><p>When I made an end of it and could look up, the king had advanced again, to a higher ledge, and stood atop another fleeing adversary. Legs astride the body, he raised his dagger arm. The air throbbed then, the skirl of wings. A carrion bird. Reflexively, my eye followed it. That is how I saw the spearman.

The dynamic duo of Clarissa Dickson Wright and Jennifer Paterson roars across the U.K. on their Triumph 950 motorbike, gathering fine recipe ideas from villages and towns all over the idyllic British countryside. Based on a popular BBC cookery program of the same name, the book bursts with the unbeatable flavors of heavy cream, <i>real</i> butter, and full-fat cheeses. The book is divided into five important food groups: fish, meat, cakes, fruit, and game. Tempting color photographs of the Fat Ladies' recipes titillate the taste buds. Irresistible is Jennifer's Adult Chocolate Cake; the combination of ingredients--bittersweet chocolate, sugar, butter, and eggs--form a divine creation certain to elicit groans of ecstasy from all who sample it.<p> The featured recipes are rich in flavor and texture. How about Ham with Leeks and Cream Sauce to warm up a rainy afternoon? Or Yorkshire Gingerbread, a stunningly beautiful dessert heaped with cream. Some of the recipes are not for the faint of heart (or vegetarians); Rabbit with Anchovies and Capers, and Pigeon Breast with Honey and Ginger may not be everyone's cup of tea. Cooking with the Two Fat Ladies is quite an event--a culinary trek into the land of politically incorrect butter and chocolate, laced with a dash of quintessential British humor.</p>Clarissa Writes:<br><br>Surrounded as we are by water, we are terribly served for fish. My sister once lived in the center of Spain, and the fish merchants came up from the coast three times a week with live fish. Here, the average fishmonger in large towns, when you can find one, offers a limited choice, and the fish is not always in its first flush of freshness. Supermarket fish is usually a disgrace and a victim of some central buying and distribution policy, which means it has traveled the country more times than Jennifer and I have in this series! The most useful tool in judging the freshness of fish is the nose, quickly followed by the eyes. The chances of your being allowed to smell an individual fish in a supermarket are slight, but you can challenge your fishmonger who will usually permit ou. Of, course, if you make a friend out of him you won't need to check.<br><br>As I wright this introduction, I am sitting in the Sharksfin Hotel in Mevagissey, having just enjoyed a well-earned hot bath laced with epsom salts. We have spent the afternoon at sea with two splendid crab fishermen. Jennifer and I were both soaked to the skin and had a high old time singing (at least Jennifer did) sea chanties with our new friends. The pots held a good haul of crabs and three of what passes for good-sized lobsters these days. When Queen Victoria visited Edinburgh they served a hundred-pound lobster as the centerpiece of her civic banquet!<br><br>The port is quiet today because many fishermen have gone up to London to petition Parliament to support our fishing industry. Yesterday I spoke to a vistitor who had gone up to Cornwall - he was only in his sixties - and he said , "It is impossible to believe that they have almost fished the seas dry." The best way to protect our fishing industry is, of course, to buy fresh fish. Then demand will keep our supplies from being exported.<br><br>Neither of us much believe the pronouncements of soi-disant health experts--we both eat fish because we love it, the fresher the better. So for once we are not out of step with these "experts" in believing in the health benefits of fish. However, do not bypass advice to eat oily fish by taking fish oil tablets--it isn't the same.<br><br>We have seen some wonderful fish since we have been here, such as the underrated coley, which Jennifer turned into a luscious fish pie. Coley--similar to pollack--is still amazingly underpriced and very good. We've also seen the hideous monkfish, the true denizon of the deep with its huge head and delicious flesh, ling cod, John Dory--still bearing St. Peter's thumbprint--the sad faced little gurnards, which Jennifer loves so much, and so many more.<br><br>In the "Mr. Bistro" restaurant on the quay, where we ate many meals, Sally, the owner, cooked us wonderful fish so fresh it needed little more than seasoning, and we laughed and flirted with Lawrence and Trevor and John et al. You don't need to go abroad to meet handsome fishermen.<br><br>In our recipes we have tried to give you a variety of uses for different fish, to suit all pockets and occasions. There are really only two things to remember with fish: by it as fresh as possible (we have given you tips to help with this) and please don't overcook it, because a very hot serving dish can easily remedy that situation.<br><br>When I cooked on a charter yacht in the United States, I wanted to bring back some steamer clams and Maine lobster for my brother, to convince him that New England seafood was the best. The customs officer heard the lobsters scrambling away in my bag and said I couldn't bring them through if they were alive. Can I if they are dead, I asked? Yes, said the customs officer. So, I took off my brooch in order to drive the pin through the brain of each lobster. What are you doing? Said the officer. I was planning to kill them, I replied. Not in front of me, you're not, says the officer. So I got them through alive.<br><br>Clarrisa</p><h2>Temari Techniques: A Visual Guide to Making Japanese Embroidered Thread Balls</h2><p><p>Bringing a time-honored art form into the modern needle-working world, this visually rich how-to guide reveals the techniques of Japanese temari balls.

Under a heavy blanket of lowering snow clouds and in the shadow of the hills the time made little or no difference: everything looked grey ... except that which now lay exposed, with the snow shovelled back from it, under the canopy of a scenes-of-crime canvas rigged up by the local police. That--what was left of it--was not grey but red. Very red. And torn ..."Animal," said old Angus McGowan, giving a curt, knowing nod. "A creature did it, an' a big yin at that!""Aye, that's what we thought," Inspector Ianson returned the old man's nod. "A beast for sure. That's why we called you in, Angus. But now the big question: what <i>sort</i> of a beast? And how a beast ... I mean, up here in the snow and all?""Eh?" Angus McGowan looked at the Police Inspector curiously, even scathingly. "Up here in the snow and a'? Why ... where else, man?"Ianson shrugged, and shivered, but not entirely from the cold. "Where else?" He frowned as he pondered his old friend and rival's meaning, then shrugged again. "Just about anywhere else, I should think! The African veldt, maybe? The Australian outback? India? But Scotland? What, and Auld Windy, Edinburgh herself, little more than seven or eight miles away? No lions or tigers or bears up here, Angus--not unless they escaped from a zoo! Which is the other reason I called you in on it, as well you know."Angus glanced at him through rheumy, watering eyes. The cold--and, just as the Inspector himself had felt it, maybe something other than the cold--had seeped through to the old vet's bones. But then, the sight of bloody, violent, unnatural death will have a similar effect on most men.Inspector Ianson was tall, well over six feet, and thin as a pole. But for all that he was getting on a bit in years, George Ianson remained spry and alert,mentally and physically active. Homicide was his job (he might often be heard complaining, in his dry, emotionless brogue, "Man, how I hate mah work! It's sheer <i>murrr</i>der!"), and this was his beat, his area of responsibility: a roughly kite-shaped region falling between Edinburgh and Glasgow east to west, Stirling and Dumfries north to south. Outside that kite a man could get himself killed however he might or might not choose, and his body never have to suffer the cold, calculating gaze of George Ianson. But inside it ..."Africa? India?" Angus echoed the gangling Inspector, then squinted at the tossed and tangled corpse before shaking his head in denial. "No, no, George. She was no big cat, this yin. Nor a dog ... but <i>like</i> a dog, aye!"It was Ianson's turn to study the other: dour old Angus McGowan, whom he'd known for years. A living caricature! Typically a "canny old Scotsman," hugging his knowledge as close to his chest as a gambler with his cards, or a rich man with his wealth. His rheumy grey eyes--the eyes of a hawk for all that they were misted--missed nothing; his blue-veined nose seemed sensitive as a bloodhound's; his knowledge (he'd been a recognized authority in zoology for all of thirty years) brimmed in the library of his brain like an encyclopaedia of feral lore. Quite simply, as the Inspector was gifted to know men--their ways and minds and, in his case especially, their criminal minds--so Angus was gifted to know animals.Between the two of them, on those rare occasions when the one might call upon the other for his expert knowledge, it had become a game, a competition, no less than the chess game they played once a week in the Inspector's study at his home in Dalkeith. For here, too, however serious the case, they vied one with the other, trying each other's minds to see which would come closest to the truth. The beauty of it was this: in chess there's only one winner, but here they could both win."<i>Like</i> a dog?" Ianson looked again, deeply into McGowan's watery eyes, his wrinkled face. Old Angus: all five foot four or five of him, shrivelled as last year's walnuts, but standing tall now with some sure knowledge, some inner secret that loaned him stature. Nodding, and careful to avoid the bloodied snow, he went to one knee. Not that it mattered greatly--no need to worry about the destruction of evidence now; the scenes-of-crime men had been and gone all of an hour ago--but Angus didn't want this poor devil's blood on his good overcoat.Looking up at Ianson from where he kneeled--and had the situation been other than it was--the slighter man might well have grinned. Instead he grimaced, tapped the side of his dripping nose with his index finger, and answered, "Shall we say--oh, Ah dinnae ken--a dog <i>o'sorts?</i> Shall we say, a dog, or a bitch, o' a different colour? Like maybe, grey?"A great grey dog. Angus could mean only one sort of beast. Ridiculous! Except he wasn't given to making ridiculous statements. Wherefore:"From a zoo?" Ianson gripped McGowan's shoulder as he made to straighten up. "Or maybe a circus? Have you heard of an escape, then? Has one got out?""One what?" The other was all wide-eyed innocence."Come now, Angus!" The Inspector tut-tutted. "A wild creature of thesnows, like a great, grey, handsome dog? You can only be hinting at a wolf, surely?""Hintin', is it!" the other chuckled, however drily, and was serious in a moment. "Ah'm no hintin', George. Ye want mah opinion? This <i>was</i> a wolf, aye! An' one hell of a wolf at that! But escaped frae a zoo ... ?" He shook his head; not in denial, more out of puzzlement. "Ah've never come across a beast this size--no in any zoo in England, Scotland or Wales, at least. And as for yere circuses--what, at this time of year? Certainly no up here! An' so, well, Ah really canna say; Ah mean, Ah wouldnae <i>care</i> to commit mahsel'.""But you've done exactly that," the Inspector pointed out. "The piece is moved, Angus. You can't put it back.""Wolf, aye!" the other snapped, more decisively now. "But as for how she got here, her origin ..." He offered a twitch of his thin shoulders, stamped numb feet, blew into cupped hands. "It's your move, George. It's your move.""Me ... I say we move in out of the cold!" Ianson shook himself, both mentally and physically, breathed deeply of the wintry air, deliberately forced himself to draw back from the morbid spell, the dreadful fascination of the case--for the moment, anyway. For if McGowan was right, which in all likelihood he was (or there again not, for after all, the Inspector did have information to the contrary), then it was out of his hands. Murder by a man is one thing ... but by a dog, a wolf, or some other wild creature, then it becomes something else: a savaging, a misadventure, simply a killing. (And what of a man <i>and</i> a dog?) But <i>if</i> McGowan was right, then they'd need to call in a different kind of hunter with a very different brief: to kill on sight!Old Angus guessed what he was thinking--the latter part of it, anyway--and was quick to say, "But first we must try to prove it, or narrow down the suspects, at least.""Back to the house?" Ianson ducked out into the open with his small friend close behind. The house he referred to was one of a picturesque cluster standing some three hundred yards away across the footbridge. Once a great farm with outbuildings, now Sma' Auchterbecky housed a small community, scarcely a hamlet, in the very lee of the mountains."Ah can make a few calls frae there, aye," Angus nodded. "D'ye see the telephone wires?""And I've a few more questions for the girl," the Inspector replied, turning up the collar of his coat. He scanned the land all about, noted that it had started to snow again: great fat flakes that fell straight out of a leaden sky. In the lowering atmosphere there was little or no wind."A pretty enough place in the summer," McGowan commented. "But in the winter? A hell o' a place for a man tae die. <i>Huh!</i> An' a hell o' a <i>way</i> for one tae die, too!" They stood side by side a while, scanning the valley between the hills. Nearby, a police Land Rover hunched on the verge at the side of the road, also a squad car fitted with snow chains, and an ambulance with its rear doors open, waiting. The blue lights of the vehicles, silently revolving, loaned eerie, intermittent illumination to the handful of stamping, arm-flapping uniformed policemen and paramedics in attendance. Exhaust fumes from the Land Roverwent up in a blue-grey spiral, mimicking the smoke from the cluster of near-distant cottage chimneys.Ianson signalled the paramedics forward; now they could take the body--its remains--out of here. The forensic lab in Edinburgh would be its next port of call, then the morgue. But there wouldn't be much gutting of this one. He'd had more than his fair share of that already."A hell of a way to die?" The Inspector echoed his companion curiously, enigmatically. "Or maybe a weird sort of ... I don't know, justice, maybe?" There was that in his voice which caused old McGowan to glance at him sharply. Something he'd not been informed of, then? Oh, the vet would stand by his claim to the bitter end, that this was the work of a wolf. For he'd seen (indeed he had sensed, <i>felt</i>) evidence which to him was indisputable. But Ianson was the policeman after all, and a damned good one! Anyway, it wouldn't do to press the point; a man can't be seen to know too much, or he might have too much explaining to do. A hunch is one thing, but an assertion needs proving."Justice?" Angus let his sharp tone reveal his own suspicions. "Somethin' ye've nae told me, George?" It was hardly surprising; this was the way their game usually went.Ianson's smile was grim. "Oh, a lot to come from this yet, Angus ... not least from you! Nothing's solved until everything is known." And before the other could question further: "Let's get on over to the house now. We can talk as we go ..."&nbsp;<br>"I know him," Ianson admitted, as they crossed the footbridge."The victim?""Victim, villain, whatever," the Inspector shrugged. "John Moffat's his name. I wouldn't have known his body--who would? But I recognized his face. Moffat, aye: prime suspect in a murder case in Glasgow just a year ago. Then, too, he'd done it in the snow; a park on the outskirts of the city, in the wee small hours of the morning. The same <i>modus operandi:</i> he dug a hole in a snowdrift, chose a prostitute on her way home and dragged her in. He raped and murdered her. Slit her throat ear to ear. He'd been seen in the park earlier. There were one or two other bits of inconclusive evidence ... not enough to pin it on him.""He walked away frae it." McGowan nodded."But not away from this one," Ianson's voice was grim. "So it's one down ... but it's still one to go.""Ye're saying that this was ... what, revenge? Which means ye believe it was a man. A man and his bloody big dog, maybe?"Ianson glanced at him out the corner of his eye. "Maybe," he answered. "Which would put the whammy on your wolf theory."The other made no reply. It suited him either way. He knew that Ianson wouldn't have asked him along if he hadn't at least suspected a large canine or some other animal. The Inspector had admitted as much."I only know that someone protected the girl," Ianson went on. "Except he did too damn thorough a job of it!""Someone close to the Glasgow prostitute, maybe?""Eh? Aye, possibly. Close to that one, anyway.""Oh? Has there been more than one, then? Unfair, George!" McGowan tut-tutted. "A man cannae play if the lights are out! Ah have tae know all yere moves.""One more at least," Ianson said. "Gleneagles, two winters ago.""In the snow again! And no too far away, at that. A prostitute, was she?""Aye. We didn't find that one until the first of the warm weather when the snow melted. She'd been there a month or more. Any evidence had been washed away. Our wee man back there could have done it, though. Again, same <i>modus operandi.</i> But of course we didn't know him then. He didn't come into the picture until the Glasgow thing.""And that's it?""That's it for the prostitute murders ... well, as far as I'm aware. Of course there could be others we <i>don't</i> know about. People disappear and are never found--as well you know." And again he gave that sideways glance."But if our man John Moffat wasnae linked to the Gleneagles murder, and if who or whatever killed him was somebody out for revenge, then this new killer can only be someone who knew the Glasgow girl, surely?"Ianson frowned. "Or someone who knew John Moffat, what he was doing--someone close to him, maybe?--who thought it was time he was stopped.""No just someone protectin' this girl especially, then?""Eh?" Ianson paused and stared hard at the other. "When I said she'd been protected, I meant by accident; by someone just happening on the scene, as it were.""Ye hadnae thought o' the other sort o' protection, then? That this one's pimp might have been lookin' out for her?""Pimp?""Well, it follows that if yere man only kills whores, the girl must be one. And if so, she probably has a pimp. Someone--and his dog?--who was waiting for her when she got dropped off last night!"The Inspector started, then grinned and took the other's arm above the elbow. Frail as old Angus seemed, the resilience of his flesh never failed to surprise Ianson; he felt the muscles move under the man's clothing, bunching at his unexpected grip as if resenting it. "Now see!" Ianson said. "What a grand team we make! Why, it's possible ye've just hit the nail right on the head!"McGowan freed himself and said, "Maybe. But it's like ye said: nothing's solved until everything is known." And now it was time to change direction again: "Personally, well, Ah still opine tae a big animal. On its own. A wild thing come down out o' the hills tae hunt.""I thought we had discounted the wolf theory?" The Inspector was making for the houses again."No, <i>you</i> had," McGowan told him. "But me, Ah have several theories. See, if ye'd no told me about they other murders, or that this John Moffat was a suspect, Ah'd still be thinkin' in terms o' a wild yin. And deep down inside, Ah still am.""A wild one? How long ago since there was a wild wolf in Scotland, Angus?""Two hundred and fifty years, that we know of," the other answered. "ButScotland's a big place, and plenty of wild country still. All over the world the wolves are stealin' back down frae the north, so why not here?""Because we're an island, Angus, that's why!""Is that so? Then explain the big cats on Bodmin Moor, and Dartmoor, and other places. Sheep killers, them--and real!""Not proven," Ianson said."Proven for mah money!" McGowan snorted. "Ah was down in Devon and Cornwall, remember? They called me in on it. No, Ah didnae see the beasts in question, but Ah saw their handiwork! Big cats, George. Take mah word for it!""My God, you'll be swearing an oath on Nessie yet!" Ianson grinned. "They called you in on that one, too, didn't they?""That American team? Three months' work there, George. It was the easiest money Ah ever made in mah life! What?

Although the word &#x201c;extinct&#x201d; was bandied about, their passing seemed to fit the downward spiral of native wildlife in the Southwest that began in the early twentieth century.

In this famished state, it is no wonder that when we do finally encounter wild animals, we are quite surprised by the sheer truth of them.<br><br>Nothing speaks the truth quite like a 220-pound desert bighorn ram mounted atop a standing female, thrusting his heavy pelvis back and forth like there was no tomorrow.<br><br>It was the rut. Males, usually solo or in bachelor bands, had joined the females, which for the rest of the year lived separately with random groups of juveniles. The rams were glossy, fat, spirited. Their thick, curled horns and heavy testicles carried a few million years of evolutionary momentum. Here in the canyon, not much else mattered but the bone and muscle needed to transport these body parts. On four hooves rode massive sperm factories.<br><br>I had put the river between myself and the rutting grounds, not that I was much more than wallpaper as the sheep copulated. I shared guilt over trespass with other voyeurs: the few subdominant rams, unlucky in love; six nearby ewes; a pair of lecherous ravens perched on a boulder.<br><br>The mating unfolded quickly but with a ritualized certainty. Among a species with a complex repertoire of social behaviors, the penalty of ambiguity is reproductive failure.<br><br>As the ram dropped off the mount, the other males brawled in rushes, kicks, and threat displays. One lunged toward the ewe, only to have his butt smashed by her guardian, a ram of spent force but fixed vigilance. The ewe ran off and disappeared from view, pursued by the younger suitors. The snoopy ravens left their perch and followed. The remaining ewes, already inseminated or not yet in estrus and therefore not ready to breed, moved about restlessly, then settled down to feed.<br><br>The Colorado Plateau canyon country is one of several &#x201c;wilderness&#x201d; holdouts of this subspecies of a North American bovid family, genus Ovis, commonly known as mountain sheep. Strict regulations prohibit the hunting of desert bighorns except by special permit. Compared to their sport-celebrity hulky northern cousin, the Rocky Mountain bighorn (Ovis canadensis canadensis) of the intermountain West and Canadian Rockies, desert bighorns are smaller, paler, and longer in ear. They are more isolated and fewer in number. In some places, they face extinction on their native range.<br><br>Four races of desert bighorn sheep live in the arid wilds of the American Southwest and Mexico. Of these races, my momentarily sex-crazed sheep are Nelson&#x2019;s bighorns (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), occupants of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert.<br><br>The ewes that fed quietly on the talus of a river canyon had slender, upright horns that escaped notice, while the horns of males dominated one&#x2019;s gaze. Ram horns flare and curl. Aboriginal southwesterners took their form and gave them to their gods. For modern humans, this headgear is an icon of blood sport. To other sheep, ram horns are social organs.<br><br>Desert bighorns are blocky, long-necked ungulates, grayish brown in color, sometimes more gray than brown, or pale beige, or with a russet cast. Their noses are moist and their rumps are white. They eat dry, abrasive plants, digesting them with four-chambered stomachs and the help of protozoa and bacteria.<br><br>The five gaits of bighorn sheep reflect their mental state, from a pompous, show-offy walk to an exuberant trot down a near-vertical rock face or a twenty-five-mile-per-hour escape run. Their hearts pump at a rate of eighty beats per minute. The life of a bighorn sheep is a life spent on cliffs.<br><br>The rut marked the beginning of my year among desert bighorns, a calendar in which I matched my seasonal geography to theirs.<br><br>I made up a name of my own and gave it to the herd that lived in the river canyon: the Blue Door Band. Over the four seasons that I would spend with them, I would be their amiable, nosy neighbor. I peered at them through binoculars, spotting scope, and with naked eye. I watched them stare into space, fall asleep on their own feet, curl up in a tight sheep ball and nap with their chins on the ground. I watched them yawn, chew, stretch.<br><br>They scratched their backs on rocks. They hated brushy densities of trees. Their tongues hung out when they were thirsty. A few dropped dead. A few went swimming. The ewes raised a new generation. The rams roamed about alone or in ram bands, then came together and bashed heads, curled lips, and engaged in wildly testicular behavior.<br><br>True to their species, these animals loved bleak, hair-ball country. They were nervous, gregarious, hilarious. Agile, gorgeous, faithful to place to the point of disaster. They came with personalities: the bullies, the head bangers, the celibate pacifist ram, the barren ewes, the lambs perched atop sheer pinnacles of rock, leaping straight up in the air like toast popping out of a toaster. They were often elusive and spectral. To see them was a blessing.<br><br>As they entered the rut, the Blue Door Band numbered about eighty sheep. Out of this population, and depending on the season, I would sometimes see loners, trios, or groups that ranged from five to twenty individuals. I gave the sheep full, held-breath attention, sometimes lifting my binoculars to my eyes at midday, unaware of the passing hours until I dropped them, only then noticing that the sun had nearly set.<br><br>Or I would ignore the group completely and stick my head in a book, T. H. White&#x2019;s <i>The Goshawk</i>, trading ungulates for<br>the arts of falconry. The wind whipped the pages. The sheep bleat-growled at my betrayal.<br><br>I gazed at distant mesas. Took naps. One minute, I swore eternal devotion to my little bovid band; the next minute, I entertained a feckless urge to hop in a boat and float down the river and disappear around the bend, ditching the sheep.<br><br>Sometimes I ditched the sheep. I left them for the seductive river or for other bighorns scattered in the far-flung deserts. I sent them postcards from New Mexico, California, Mexico.<br><br>For most of the year, though, I was loyal to the Blue Door Band, preternaturally attentive&#x2014;how could anyone not be?&#x2014;and shamelessly anthropomorphic. I wanted the bighorns to adopt me, a kind of reverse Bo Peep arrangement. Me, their lost human. Their pet. The primate among herbivores. The bovids&#x2019; equivalent of a wolf boy.<br><br>Being with these wild animals was like prayer, a meditation that ranged from dopey to dreamy to absorption so profound, it stopped my blood. Their habits and motions formed a liturgy that mapped the prayer, liturgy as &#x201c;the sanctification of time,&#x201d; a place where I was willing to wait in stillness, to count on nature&#x2019;s rhythms to calm my messy ones.<br><br>More often, it was the singular company of mammals I delighted in, just the sheep being sheep while I perched on a boulder or rock ledge, my feet falling asleep from sitting too long.<br><br>In the warm seasons, I could enter sheep company along the river. Winter conditions often kept me at a greater distance. I had to make long overland treks on foot to watching posts above a deep redrock canyon. The posts gave an unobstructed view of the Blue Door Band&#x2019;s range.<br><br>A remote fold of their canyon held a pile of stones that marked the remains of a hand-built shelter. Twenty years earlier, I had studied the shelter before it collapsed into an indeterminate pile of rubble. Then the shelter had a domed roof, a flat stone hearth, and a door frame that faced the sunrise. The door&#x2019;s milled boards were painted blue, the deep blue of the sky where it meets the canyon&#x2019;s redrock rims. This place gave me the idea for the sheep band&#x2019;s name.<br><br>On my watching days, I often found sheep all over the place, Velcro&#x2019;d to the steep, rocky cliffs. Other times, I saw no sheep at all. I glassed the walls for hours. Both the day and the canyon felt empty. This was when sloppy meditation moved to true prayer, to words said against fear.<br><br>While you are among wild sheep, they can move out of sight the moment you bow your head to notice that the zipper on your jeans is open. Then you look up, look where they were or might be, and behold only rock and sky. When they disappeared for an entire day, or if I was at a post for several days and could not find them, I was alarmed.<br><br>Certain days, with sheep flesh present, were gifts set against a worrisome history, a past that might too easily repeat itself. Smack in the middle of the red-boned desert, these creatures lived an island life. They occupied a small enclave of wild country, surrounded by perils that could (and not for the first time) nearly decimate them.<br><br>The story of their precarious, marginal existence&#x2014;the story of the continent&#x2019;s native fauna on their unstoppable trajectory from bounty to scarcity and even demise&#x2014;was a familiar one, repeated over and over like a six-hundred-pound mantra lodged between the ears. How had this tribe of bighorns escaped the slide toward oblivion? No one could promise me that they would continue to survive.<br><br>As I sat contemplating this, the air had an edge of glass to it, the trees no burden of leaves. The light was thin and brittle. Scattered brush dressed the rust-colored canyon in brown, silver, and pale olive. For now, on this bright winter day on the Colorado Plateau, the river glistened in the sun and the sheep browsed nearby without fear. Several ewes interrupted their feeding and stared across the gorge. Their gaze gave notice of the direction they would soon take.<br><br>Then a pale turn of light, a shift of tectonic plate, some glimmer of a sheep idea, set them in motion. The animals glided down a precipice of jumbled boulders as if it were a wave of silk. I was not invited to go along. When the sheep disappear...</p><h2>The Opposite of Fate</h2><p><b>In her first book of nonfiction, bestselling novelist Amy Tan shares her personal philosophy of fate.</b> <br><br> Amy Tan was born into a family that believed in fate. In <i>The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings</i>, she explores this legacy, as well as American circumstances, and finds ways to honor the past while creating her own brand of destiny. She discovers answers in everyday actions and attitudes-from writing stories, decorating her house with charms, learning to ski, and living with squirrels, to dealing with three members of her family afflicted with brain disease, surviving natural disasters, and shaking off both family curses and the expectations that she should become a doctor and a concert pianist. <br><br> With the same spirit, humor, and magic that characterize her beloved novels, Amy Tan presents a refreshing antidote to the world-weariness and uncertainties we face today, contemplating how things happen-in her own life and beyond-but always returning to the question of fate and its opposites: the choices, charms, influences, attitudes, and lucky accidents that shape us all.</p><p>Amy Tan begins <i>The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings</i>, a collection of essays that spans her literary career, on a humorous note; she is troubled that her life and novels have become the subject of a "Cliff&#x2019;s Notes" abridgement. Reading the little yellow booklet, she discovers that her work is seen as complex and rich with symbolism. However, Tan assures her readers that she has no lofty, literary intentions in writing her novels--she writes for herself, and insists that the recurring patterns and themes that critics find in them are entirely their own making. This self-deprecating stance, coupled with Tan&#x2019;s own clarification of her intentions, makes <i>The Opposite of Fate</i> feel like an extended, private conversation with the author. <p> Tan manages to find grace and frequent comedy in her sometimes painful life, and she takes great pleasure in being a celebrity. "Midlife Confidential" brings readers on tour with Tan and the rest of the leather-clad writers&#x2019; rock band, the Rock-Bottom Remainders. And "Angst and the Second Book" is a brutally honest, frequently hysterical reflection on Tan&#x2019;s self-conscious attempts to follow the success of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>. </p><p> In a collection so diverse and spanning such a long period of time, inevitably some of the pieces feel dated or repetitious. Yet, Tan comes off as a remarkably humble and sane woman, and the book works well both to fill in her biography and to clarify the boundaries between her life and her fiction. In her final, title essay, Tan juxtaposes her personal struggles against a persistent disease with the nation&#x2019;s struggles against terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11. She declares her transformative, artistic power over tragedy, reflecting: "As a storyteller, I know that if I don&#x2019;t like the ending, I can write a better one." <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley </i></p>Amy Tan is the author of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>, <i>The Kitchen God's Wife</i>, <i>The Hundred Secret Senses</i>, <i>The Bonesetter's Daughter</i>, and two children's books, <i>The Moon Lady</i> and <i>The Chinese Siamese Cat</i>, which is now a PBS production called Sagwa, for which Tan is a creative consultant and writer. Tan was also a co-producer and co-screenwriter of the film version of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>, and her essays and stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies. Her work has been translated into more than twenty-five languages.</p><h2>Off the Road: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac, and Ginsberg</h2><p>The intimate story of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady written by the woman who loved them both. Off the Road is not only Carolyn Cassady&#39;s poignant account of their stormy love triangle, but a lively and accurate portrait of the Beat generation. Includes previously unpublished letters, photographs, and drawings from the author&#39;s private collection.</p><p>Neal Cassady has been the subject of several novels, poems, and songs, but he is probably still best known as Dean Moriarty in Kerouac's On the Road . This biography is an expanded, more detailed, far superior version of Carolyn Cassady's Heart Beat ( LJ 9/15/76), the memoir that served as the basis for John Byrum's 1980 film of the same name. Cassady is more expansive here. She describes the complex, intense relationships that developed between her husband, Kerouac, and Ginsberg, and she analyzes their effects on her marriage. Her writing is sincere and engaging, full of pain and struggle but also love. Highly recommended.<br><i>- William Gargan, Brooklyn Coll.

Miss Bianca would seem to be a pampered creature, and not, you would suppose, the mouse to dispatch on an especially challenging and extraordinarily perilous mission. However, it is precisely Miss Bianca that the Prisoners&#x2019; Aid Society picks for the job of rescuing a Norwegian poet imprisoned in the legendarily dreadful Black Castle (we all know, don&#x2019;t we, that mice are the friends of prisoners, tending to their needs in dungeons and oubliettes everywhere). Miss Bianca, after all, is a poet too, and in any case she is due to travel any day now by diplomatic pouch to Norway. There Miss Bianca will be able to enlist one Nils, known to be the bravest mouse in the land, in a desperate and daring endeavor that will take them, along with their trusty companion Bernard, across turbulent seas and over the paws and under the maws of cats into one of the darkest places known to man or mouse. It will take everything they&#x2019;ve got and a good deal more to escape<br> with their own lives, not to mention the poet.<br> Margery Sharp&#x2019;s classic tale of pluck, luck, and derring-do is amply and beautifully illustrated by the great Garth Williams.</p><p>Margery Sharp (1905&#x2013;1991) published fifteen novels for adults before writing <i>The Rescuers</i> (1959), her first book for children. Born Clara Margery Melita Sharp in Salisbury, England, she spent part of her childhood in Malta before returning to England for high school. By the time she graduated with honors in French from the University of London, she had already begun publishing short stories; her work would later become a fixture in such American and British magazines as <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>, <i>Ladies&#x2019; Home Journal</i>, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, and <i>Punch</i>. Several of Sharp&#x2019;s novels were serialized and a number became successful films, including Cluny Brown (screenplay by Ernst Lubitsch) and <i>Britannia Mews</i> (written by Ring Lardner, Jr.); the Rescuers series eventually numbered nine volumes and inspired two animated feature films from Disney.<br> Garth Williams (1912&#x2013;1996) illustrated nearly one hundred books for children, including <i>Stuart Little</i> and <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i> by E.B. White, <i>A Cricket in Times Square</i> by George Selden, and the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Born in New York City to English artist parents, Williams lived in New Jersey, France, and Canada before moving to England in 1922. He had plans to be an architect but ultimately studied painting, design, and sculpture at the Westminster Art School and the Royal College of Art. Having returned to the United States after World War II, Williams found work at <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he met E. B. White just as the latter was finishing <i>Stuart Little</i>. Williams also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, including <i>The Chicken Book: A Traditional Rhyme</i>, <i>The Adventures of Benjamin Pink</i>, <i>Baby Animals</i>, and <i>The Rabbits&#x2019; Wedding</i>."Margery Sharp's mouse-centric 1959 adventure, The Rescuers, has only been out of print for a decade, but it is well worth revisiting. For one thing, it has just been reissued in handsome hardback as part of the New York Review Children's Collection, with drawings by Garth Williams. For another, this new incarnation provides an excuse to rescue the story for a generation of children who might otherwise know only the animated 1977 Disney movie of the same name. As with most children's classics, Ms. Sharp's original work is much funnier and more interestingly textured than the high-fructose movie version." -- Megan Cox Gurdon, T<i>he Wall Street Journal </i><br><br>&#x201c;Miss Sharp&#x2019;s delicate and sophisticated humor is good fun for wise children from age 10 to 100.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jerome Cushman, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Seasons in Hell</h2><p>A candid, irreverent, behind-the-scenes account of two seasons with the 1973-75 Texas Rangers, called by many the worst baseball team in history, by the then-sports writer for the Fort Worth Star Telegram. 20,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Mike Shropshire is a longtime journalist who has written for numerous newspapers and magazines such as <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and is the author of several books, including <i>When the Tuna Went down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land</i>. He lives in Dallas, Texas.A tiresome ``gonzo'' journalism account of mid-1970s life on the road with a big league ballclub. As a 30-ish beat writer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Shropshire drew the unenviable task of covering the Texas Rangers, a sad-sack team recently relocated from Washington, D.C. (where they were a 1961 expansion descendant of the original Senators team that became the Minnesota Twins--a fact misstated by the author). In a bit of characteristic overstatement, Shropshire comments that the ``Texas Rangers were not really a franchise but rather like a Kurt Vonnegut novel.'' And during his stint with the club, the author witnessed (admittedly through a haze of booze and prescription painkillers) some of the game's most absurd goings-on, some of which actually occurred on the field. While the Rangers were not a quality attraction, Shropshire probably should have spent more time reporting on the team's play (which, at least during 1974, wasn't all that bad--they did challenge the powerful Oakland A's for the American League West title) rather than take his regular discursive excursions into the seamy north Texas baseball demimonde of whores, booze, and fistfights--or, even worse, describe his frequent hangovers (``My head was like a gelatinous, blimp-sized container of nerve endings''). Still, for all this noodling, Shropshire does manage some dead-on character sketches, notably of 18-year-old phenom David Clyde, a number-one draft pick who, as a result of being prodded into service too soon in his career in order to fill seats at the Rangers' cavernous and cadaverous ballpark, turned out to be one of the game's biggest busts; Billy Martin, the mercurial, self-destructive manager of the '74 and '75 clubs; ``Strange Ranger'' Willie Davis; and other players, coaches, fans, and sportswriters. This book is unfortunately hamstrung by its author's tortured delivery. It's the literary equivalent of a knuckleball; good on occasions but difficult to handle.

What unites figures as diverse as James Joyce, Caravaggio, John Milton, the architect of Chartres, Dorothy Day, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the later Bob Dylan is a peculiar and distinctive take on things, a style, a way, which flows finally from Jesus of Nazareth. Origen remarked that holiness is seeing with the eyes of Christ. Teilhard de Chardin said, with great passion, that his mission as a Christian thinker was to help people see. And Thomas Aquinas said that the ultimate goal of the Christian life is a &#x2018;beatific vision,&#x2019; an act of seeing. This book is about coming to vision through Christ.&#x201d; &#x2014; Robert Barron, from the Prelude</p><p>Barron, professor of systematic theology at Mundelein Seminary, near Chicago, offers an accessible exploration of Christian theological concepts He divides his book into three sections as he examines Christianity as a source of human transformation. In his first section, Barron argues that human nature is alienated from itself and thus humans are in need of a mediator who can draw them back to God and self. The second section takes up a renewed understanding of God in light of the alienated nature of humanity. In his final section, Barron contends that Christ is a healer and reconciler who seeks to draw humanity back into relationship with God. Along the way, Barron draws on sources as diverse as Dante, Paul Tillich, Thomas Merton and Flannery O'Connor. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Very Short Mother Goose Tales to Read Together (You Read to Me, I&#39;ll Read to You)</h2><p>Join the fun as familiar Mother Goose characters take starring roles in this latest addition to the New York Times bestselling series YOU READ TO ME, I&#39;LL READ TO YOU.

A Drawing Book. He lives in San Diego, California.<br>Grade 1-4&#x2013;In this third installment in the series, Hoberman and Emberley introduce shared reading experiences that retell and elaborate on Mother Goose rhymes. Consisting of 14 short tales, each story is designed to be read by two voices that, at times, come together for shared lines; different colored type indicates each distinct voice. Told in verse, these stories will appeal to readers who are familiar with the original rhymes. In Old Mother Hubbard, for example, the woman and her dog determine that since it's cold outside, they'll call the butcher and order in some food. The humor and rhythms in Jack, Be Nimble are reminiscent of Dr. Seuss's <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> (Random, 1960). The careful word choices are ideal for beginning and reluctant readers; Hoberman introduces simple contractions that easily blend into the rhythmic text. The bright and cheery artwork captures the humor; Little Jack Horner is portrayed as a raccoon sporting a shabby overcoat and fedora and Little Tommy Tucker is a bass-playing gorilla. Both the illustrations and text are set against clean white space for ease of reading. In addition to sharing in two voices, this book is also ideal for choral reading and classroom activities.

Born on the Gulf Coast, the son of a son of a sailing ship captain, Buffett scuffed around New Orleans in the late sixties, flunked out of Nashville (and a marriage) in 1971, and found refuge among the artists, dopers, shrimpers, and genuine characters who&#x2019;d collected at the end of the road in Key West. And it was there, in those waning outlaw days at the last American exit, where Buffett, like Hemingway before him, found his voice and eventually brought to life the song that would launch Parrot Head nation.<br> <br>And just where is Margaritaville? It&#x2019;s wherever it&#x2019;s five o&#x2019;clock; it&#x2019;s wherever there&#x2019;s a breeze and salt in the air; and it&#x2019;s wherever Buffett sets his bare feet, smiles, and sings his songs.</p><p>Ryan White, the author of <i>Springsteen: Album by Album</i> and <i>Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way</i>, has twice been named one of the top feature writers in the country by the Society for Features Journalism.

After a prologue that describes the emergence and impact of segregation in the United States, chapters follow chronologically, highlighting pivotal events, people, successes, and failures of "The Movement." Against the backdrop of the constitutional and moral struggle between the White House and Southern politicians, the author recounts the flamboyant resilience of Birmingham's Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, the battered determination of student leader John Lewis, the nonviolent leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the sacrificial commitment of the Freedom Riders. She also explores J. Edgar Hoover's covert manipulation of the FBI, the power struggle between the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the shift from nonviolence to Black Power and urban race riots, and the national political focus on the Vietnam War. Protests, marches, boycotts, and infamous tragedies are sequenced and analyzed as catalysts that fueled the movement.

But when these are set alongside other things we would never think to sing alleluia about 'death, divisions, sufferings, and even sinners 'we begin to see, as Joan Chittister says in her introduction, that "Life itself is an exercise in learning to sing 'alleluia ' here in order to recognize the face of God hidden in the recesses of time. To deal with the meaning of 'alleluia ' in life means to deal with moments that do not feel like 'alleluia moments' at al."</p> <p>In this series of reflections it becomes clear that singing "alleluia" is not a way to escape reality but receptivity to another kind of reality beyond the immediate and the delusional, of helping us understand what is now and what is to come.</p> <p><i>Joan Chittister, OSB, is a Benedictine nun and international lecturer who has been a leading voice in spirituality for more than thirty years.

The varied subjects of the 23 essays&#x2013;faith, doubt, Genesis, saints&#x2013;are very loosely grouped, and Williams contributes only five, a shortcoming of the book given the provocative originality with which the Anglican primate thinks. He writes of good sinners&#x2013;those with a degree of awareness of something much larger or of divine fullness preparing to create its own echo in the world.

Reprint.</p><p>Some authors are worth reading because of their area of expertise, even when their objectivity may be questionable. This is true of John Douglas, who follows up his <i>Mindhunter</i> with another assortment of his observations and opinions from his ex-job as the FBI's top expert on constructing behavioral profiles of criminals. This book contains several passages of interest: a detailed discussion of the <i>modus operandi</i> versus the "signature" of a murder, and how each relates to motive; thoughts on how the press and the public can be used to flush out a killer; a taxonomy of pedophiles, with a chapter on how to protect children from them; a detailed analysis of the savage sex-murder of a female Marine; a profile of the Nicole Simpson/Ron Goldman killer; and a report on how the courts are handling behavioral testimony. Always biased, often egotistical, but uniquely experienced--that's Douglas.In the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Mindhunter</i>, John Douglas, who headed the FBI's elite Investigative Support Unit, told the story of his brilliant and terrifying career tracking down some of the most heinous criminals in history. Using behavioral profiling and criminal investigative analysis to get into the head and psyche of both the criminal and victim -- to feel what they felt at the critical moment -- Douglas helped crack many high profile cases, including the Trailside Killer, the Atlanta child murders, and the Tylenol murders. Now, working again with his co-author Mark Olshaker, Douglas delves further into the criminal mind with a series of chilling new cases in <i>Journey into Darkness</i>: Follow the FBI's premier investigative profiler as he penetrates the minds and motives of the most terrifying serial killers. <p>In <i>Journey into Darkness</i>, Douglas profiles vicious serial killers, rapists, and child molesters. He is straightforward, blunt, often irreverent, and outspoken, but takes pains not to glorify any of these murderers. Some of the unique cases Douglas discusses include: </p><li> The Clairemont killer -- Six women were found stabbed to death in San Diego, three in the same apartment complex. In each case, the killer entered through an unlocked door or window in the late morning to early afternoon. A suspect was in custody, tied to one of the murders through a DNA match. Douglas was called upon to use his profiling techniques to link the other five murders to the suspect. Douglas looked at the "signature" of the killer, and found that all the murders were committed by the same man. The prosecution used the profile to force the jury to find the defendant guilty of all six murders, if they felt he was guilty of the one murder. Celophus Prince was found guilty on all counts.<br> </li><li> The schoolgirl murders -- What became Canada's "trial of the century." Several schoolgirls disappeared in 1992; their bodies were dumped several weeks later, beaten and sexually attacked. Canadian police agencies contacted the FBI for help on the case and to get a profile on the killer and, according to witnesses, his accomplice. Following the advice of the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico, Canada aired a television special entitled "The Abduction of Kristin French," allowing agent Gregg McCrary to describe the killer's profile on air. Knowing that the murderer and his accomplice would be watching, he planned to confront the unknown killer, assuring him he would be caught. Paul Bernardo was arrested on February 17, 1993, turned in by his wife and partner in crime, Karla Leanne Homolka.. The profile was dead on the money.<br> </li><li> Richmond's First Serial Murderer -- In 1987, Richmodd, Virginia, was struck by a serial rapist/murderer. The Richmond police called upon the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico to make up a profile of the perpetrator. The crimes and profile beared a remarkable resemblance to a string of burglaries, rapes and murders in Alexandria, Virginia, several years before. Agent Steve Mardigian then formulated a complex strategy that caught the killer who fit the profile to a tee. In the process he helped free a wrongly convicted man, who due to his low intelligence level, had become confused and confessed to the crime.<br> </li><li> The brutal and sadistic murder of Suzanne Marie Collins, a beautiful young Marine on the verge of a brilliant career. The culprit was caught and confessed to her killing, but his story was very different than what really happened. By delving into Sedley Alley's mind, Douglas helped bring the murderer to justice, recreating the evening from the perspective of a sadistic and angry man. Suzanne Collins' horrifying end haunts Douglas to this day.<br> Douglas delves into other cases, including Polly Klaas' abduction and murder by Richard Allen Davis, the tragedy that lead to the creation of Megan's Law; the abduction and murder of six-year-old Cassandra Lynn Hansen, who was snatched from an evening church service; and the vicious murder and sexual assault of Nancy Newman and her two daughters, eight-year-old Melissa and three-year-old Angie in Anchorage, Alaska. He also explores the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, focusing on the double homicide purely from a behavioral perspective. Douglas examines what the facts at and surrounding the crime scene told about the killer from a behavioral point of view. From Douglas's profile, the only viable suspect to date is O.J. Simpson. <p>With <i>Journey into Darkness,</i> Douglas provides more than a glimpse into the minds of serial killers; he demonstrates what a powerful weapon behavioral science has become. Profiling criminals helps not only to capture them, but also helps society understand how these predators work and what can be done to prevent them from striking again. Douglas focuses especially on pedophiles and child abductors, fully explaining what drives them, and how to keep children away from them. As he points out, "The best way to protect your children is to know your enemy." He includes eight rules for safety, a list of steps parents can take to prevent child abduction and exploitation, tips on how to detect sexual exploitation, basic rules of safety for children, and a chart, based on age, which details the safety skills children should have to protect themselves. </p><p>In his review for <i>Mindhunter</i> in <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> Dean Koontz said, "Because of his insights and the power of the material, he leaves us shaken, gripped by a quiet grief for the innocent victims and anguished by the human condition." Journey into Darkness continues this perilous trip into the psyche of the serial killer, but also offers a glimmer of hope that profiling may enable law enforcement to see the indicators of a serial killer's mind and intervene before he kills, or kills again.</p></li></p><h2>Mandala</h2><p>This lavishly illustrated classic, selling over 70,000 copies in English and translated into four European languages, is the first to deal comprehensively with the mandala, the principle of the center, as a universal image, a vision, a way of growth, a ritual technique, and an essential life process. 92 illustrations, 11 in color.</p><p></p><h2>Faith Is...</h2><p>This touching collection of inspirational thoughts focuses on the true meaning of faith in our ordinary lives.

For these deluxe editions, Philip Pullman has created new material: papers of Colonel John Parry for the 10-year anniversary of <i>The Subtle Knife </i>(15 new pages), and letters of Mary Malone from secret Magisterium files for <i>The Amber Spyglass </i>(10 new pages). In each book, the new material has been illustrated and handlettered by renowned artist Ian Beck and will be included in the backmatter.</p><p>Each deluxe edition also features a ribbon bookmark, rough-edged pages, and Pullman's own chapter-opening spot art. These two volumes join the 2006 deluxe edition of <i>The Golden Compass </i>to form a gorgeous collectible set of the trilogy - a perfect gift for loyal Pullman readers and new fans alike.</p></p><p>With <i>The Golden Compass</i> Philip Pullman garnered every accolade under the sun. Critics lobbed around such superlatives as "elegant," "awe-inspiring," "grand," and "glittering," and used "magnificent" with gay abandon. Each reader had a favorite chapter--or, more likely, several--from the opening tour de force to Lyra's close call at Bolvangar to the great armored-bear battle. And Pullman was no less profligate when it came to intellectual firepower or singular characters. The d�mons alone grant him a place in world literature. Could the second installment of his trilogy keep up this pitch, or had his heroine and her too, too sullied parents consumed him? And what of the belief system that pervaded his alternate universe, not to mention the mystery of Dust? More revelations and an equal number of wonders and new players were definitely in order.<p> <i>The Subtle Knife</i> offers everything we could have wished for, and more. For a start, there's a young hero--from our world--who is a match for Lyra Silvertongue and whose destiny is every bit as shattering. Like Lyra, Will Parry has spent his childhood playing games. Unlike hers, though, his have been deadly serious. This 12-year-old long ago learned the art of invisibility: if he could erase himself, no one would discover his mother's increasing instability and separate them. </p><p> As the novel opens, Will's enemies will do anything for information about his missing father, a soldier and Arctic explorer who has been very much airbrushed from the official picture. Now Will must get his mother into safe seclusion and make his way toward Oxford, which may hold the key to John Parry's disappearance. But en route and on the lam from both the police and his family's tormentors, he comes upon a cat with more than a mouse on her mind: "She reached out a paw to pat something in the air in front of her, something quite invisible to Will." What seems to him a patch of everyday Oxford conceals far more: "The cat stepped forward and vanished." Will, too, scrambles through and into another oddly deserted landscape--one in which children rule and adults (and felines) are very much at risk. Here in this deathly silent city by the sea, he will soon have a dustup with a fierce, flinty little girl: "Her expression was a mixture of the very young--when she first tasted the cola--and a kind of deep, sad wariness." Soon Will and Lyra (and, of course, her d�mon, Pantalaimon) uneasily embark on a great adventure and head into greater tragedy.</p><p> As Pullman moves between his young warriors and the witch Serafina Pekkala, the magnetic, ever-manipulative Mrs. Coulter, and Lee Scoresby and his hare d�mon, Hester, there are clear signs of approaching war and earthly chaos. There are new faces as well. The author introduces Oxford dark-matter researcher Mary Malone; the Latvian witch queen Ruta Skadi, who "had trafficked with spirits, and it showed"; Stanislaus Grumman, a shaman in search of a weapon crucial to the cause of Lord Asriel, Lyra's father; and a serpentine old man whom Lyra and Pan can't quite place. Also on hand are the Specters, beings that make cliff-ghasts look like rank amateurs. </p><p> Throughout, Pullman is in absolute control of his several worlds, his plot and pace equal to his inspiration. Any number of astonishing scenes--small- and large-scale--will have readers on edge, and many are cause for tears. "You think things have to be <i>possible</i>," Will demands. "Things have to be <i>true</i>!" It is Philip Pullman's gift to turn what quotidian minds would term the impossible into a reality that is both heartbreaking and beautiful. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Here is the highly anticipated second installment of Philip Pullman&#39;s epic fantasy trilogy, begun with the critically acclaimed &#34;The Golden Compass. Lyra and Will, her newfound friend, tumble separately into the strange tropical otherworld of Cittagazze, &#34;the city of magpies,&#34; where adults are curiously absent and children run wild. Here their lives become inextricably entwined when Lyra&#39;s alethiometer gives her a simple command: find Will&#39;s father. Their search is plagued with obstacles--some familiar and some horribly new and unfathomable--but it eventually brings them closer to Will&#39;s father and to the Subtle Knife, a deadly, magical, ancient tool that cuts windows between worlds. Through it all, Will and Lyra find themselves hurtling toward the center of a fierce battle against a force so awesome that leagues of mortals, witches, beasts, and spirits from every world are uniting in fear and anger against it. This breathtaking sequel will leave readers eager for the third and final volume of &#34;His Dark Materials.</p><h2>Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering</h2><p>In the same way that we fall into the arms of a loved one or drop our heads on the pillow before sleep, we can let go into the beauty and truth of who and what we really are. Falling Into Grace presents Adyashanti&#39;s response to anyone looking for a way out of suffering and into the freedom of spiritual awakening. With his first introductory book, he offers what he considers the fundamental teachings on &#34;seeing life with clear eyes&#34; to transcend the illusions that lead to unhappiness. Readers join this sought-after teacher to explore: � The concept of a separate self as the root of all suffering-and how to stop believing the thoughts that perpetuate our self-image � How to take &#34;the backward step&#34; into the pure potential of the present moment � Giving up the control we only think we have � The essential invitation of spirituality: wake up from the dream to embrace what is &#34;When we realize that there is grace in every moment, our minds will open, our hearts will expand, and we&#39;ll be able to express the peace And The love that all beings aspire to,&#34; teaches Adyashanti. Here is an opportunity to welcome a revolution in the way that we perceive life through Falling into Grace.</p><p>Adyashanti<p>When I was a young child, about seven or eight years old, one of the things I started to notice and ponder as I watched the adults around me was that the adult world is prone to suffering, pain, and conflict.&nbsp; Even though I grew up in a relatively healthy household with loving parents and two sisters, I still saw a great deal of pain around me.&nbsp; As I looked at the adult world, I wondered:&nbsp; How is it that people come into conflict?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a child, I also happened to be a great listener-some may even say an eavesdropper.&nbsp; I would listen to every conversation that went on in the house.&nbsp; In fact, it was a family joke that nothing happened in the house without me knowing about it.&nbsp; I liked to know everything&nbsp; that was going on around me, and so I spent a lot of my childhood listening to the conversation of adults, in my home and in the homes of relatives.&nbsp; Much of the time, I found what they talked about to be quite interesting, but I also noticed a certain ebb and flow to most of their discussions-how conversations moved into a little bit of conflict, then back away from it.</p></p><h2>Truth or Die</h2><p><strong>The truth will set you free&#x2014;if it doesn't kill you first.</strong> <br><br>After a serious professional stumble, attorney Trevor Mann may have finally hit his stride.

For decades, the real story of the disaster eluded journalists, historians, and the family members of the lost crew. But a small handful of Navy and government officials knew the truth: The sinking of the U.S.S. <i>Scorpion</i> on May 22, 1968, was an act of war. In <i>Scorpion Down</i>, military reporter Ed Offley reveals that the true cause of the <i>Scorpion</i>&#x2019;s sinking was buried by the U.S. government in an attempt to keep the Cold War from turning hot. For five months, the families of the <i>Scorpion</i> crew waited while the Navy searched feverishly for the missing submarine. For the first time, Offley reveals that entire search was cover-up, devised to conceal that fact that the <i>Scorpion</i> had been torpedoed by the Soviets.

He had the place to himself. In fact, he seemed to have most of the five boroughs to himself. Labor Day weekend. And a hot one. Anyone who could afford to had fled upstate or to the Long Island beaches. The rest were inside, slumped before their air conditioners. Even the homeless were off the streets, crouched in the relative cool of the subways.<br>The sun poured liquid fire through the hazy midday sky. Not a cloud in sight. But here in the shade of this leaning oak, Mr. Veilleur knew the weather was going to change soon, could read it from the worsening ache in his knees, hips, and back.<br>Other things were going to change as well. Everything, perhaps. And all for the worse.<br>He had been making sporadic trips to this corner of the cemetery since he&#x2019;d first sensed the <i>wrongness</i> here. That had been on a snowy winter night many years ago. It had taken him a while, but he&#x2019;d finally located the spot.<br>A grave, which was perfectly natural, this being a cemetery. This grave was not like the others, however. This one had no marker. But something else made this grave special: Nothing would grow over it.<br>Through the years Mr. Veilleur had seen the cemetery&#x2019;s gardeners try to seed it, sod it, even plant it with various ground covers like periwinkle, pachysandra, and ivy. They took root well all around, but nothing survived in the four-foot oblong patch over the grave.<br>Of course, they didn&#x2019;t know it was a grave. Only Mr. Veilleur and the one who had dug the hole knew that. And surely one other.<br>Mr. Veilleur did not come here often. Travel was not easy for him, even to another part of the city he had called home since the end of World War Two. Gone were the days when he walked where he wished, fearing no one. Now his eyes were bad; his back was stiff and canted forward; he leaned on a cane when he walked, and he walked slowly. He had an old man&#x2019;s body and he had to take appropriate precautions.<br>Age had not dampened his curiosity, however. He didn&#x2019;t know who had dug the grave, or who was in it. But whoever lay down there below the dirt and rocks had been touched by the enemy&nbsp;... the Otherness.<br>The enemy had been growing steadily stronger for more than two decades now. But growing carefully, staying hidden. Good thing too, for he had no one to oppose him. But he did not know that. He was waiting. For what? A sign? A particular event? Perhaps the one buried below was part of the answer. Perhaps the occupant had nothing to do with the enemy&#x2019;s quiescence.<br>No matter&#x2014;as long as the enemy remained inactive. For the longer the enemy delayed, the closer Mr. Veilleur would be to reaching the end of his days. And then he would be spared witnessing the chaotic horrors to come. His Heir would shoulder that burden.<br>A shadow fell across him and a sudden gust of wind chilled the perspiration that coated his skin. He looked up. Clouds were moving in, obscuring the sun. Time to go.<br>He stood and stared one last time at the bare dirt over the unmarked grave. He knew he would be back again. And again. Too many questions about this grave and its occupant. He sensed unfinished business here.<br>Because the grave&#x2019;s occupant did not rest easy. Did not, in fact, rest at all.<br>Mr. Veilleur turned and made his unsteady way out of St. Ann&#x2019;s cemetery. It would be good to get back to the cool apartment and get his feet up and have a glass of iced tea. He tried to believe that his wife had missed him during his absence, but with her mind the way it was, Magda probably hadn&#x2019;t even realized he was gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2005, 2011 by F.

Dating from the turn of the century, these beguiling studio &#x201c;portraits&#x201d; of tulips and sunflowers, onions and turnips, plums and pears are skillfully executed and startling in their originality. Shot as close-ups, with long exposure and spare composition, the works anticipate by decades the later achievements of modernist masters.</p><p>This volume presents Jones&#x2019;s photography in sections devoted to vegetables, flowers, and fruit, with captions taken from Jones&#x2019;s own identifications, written by hand on the back of the prints. Renowned writer and restaurateur Alice Waters describes the simple beauty of the photographs in the preface. Robert Flynn Johnson contextualizes the work in the still life tradition and pieces together the fragmentary evidence about the life of this mysterious figure, who trained as a gardener and worked on a number of private estates, but who left no notes or diaries to explain why he photographed the plants he saw every day. The perfect antidote to appetites jaded by processed foods and late twentieth-century consumerism, the legacy of Charles Jones is a reminder of the bountiful riches of nature.</p> 117 illustrations in color and black-and-white</p><p><p><strong>Sean Sexton</strong> is an Irish-born photographic collector.

Now in this completely updated second edition, we learn of discoveries made in the last decade as the family has grown from about 2500 species to nearer 3200. The latest taxonomic and nomenclatural revisions are noted in the checklist of genera, and all the original drawings are included plus twice as many color photos. A new guide to the cultivation of ornamental aroids completes this well-rounded introduction to a remarkable family.</p><p>Covers both botanical &amp; horticultural aspects of these extraordinary &amp; diverse plants in a substantially revised new edition.

All the aroids have devised cunning schemes to attract pollinators and survive adverse conditions, from the extraordinary mouse plant, which emits a mushroom-like smell and mimics the underside of a fungus to lure fungus gnats, to the &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; jack-in-the-pulpit, which changes sex from year to year depending on environmental conditions. Other bizarre features of the aroid lifecycle are described in depth as the author covers representative species in the aroid genera.</p><h2>Killing Rommel: A Novel</h2><p><b>***</b><br>To watch videos featuring the story behind <i>Killing Rommel</i>, visit <b>www.KillingRommel.com</b><br><b>***</b><br><br>Steven Pressfield&#x2019;s quintet of acclaimed, bestselling novels of ancient warfare&#x2014; <i>Gates of Fire, Tides of War, Last of the Amazons, The Virtues of War,</i> and <i>The Afghan Campaign</i>&#x2014; have earned him a reputation as a master chronicler of military history, a supremely literate and engaging storyteller, and an author with acute insight into the minds of men in battle. In <i>Killing Rommel </i>Pressfield extends his talents to the modern world with a WWII tale based on the real-life exploits of the Long Range Desert Group, an elite British special forces unit that took on the German Afrika Korps and its legendary commander, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, "the Desert Fox." <br><br>Autumn 1942. Hitler&#x2019;s legions have swept across Europe; France has fallen; Churchill and the English are isolated on their island. In North Africa, Rommel and his Panzers have routed the British Eighth Army and stand poised to overrun Egypt, Suez, and the oilfields of the Middle East. With the outcome of the war hanging in the balance, the British hatch a desperate plan&#x2014;send a small, highly mobile, and heavily armed force behind German lines to strike the blow that will stop the Afrika Korps in its tracks. Narrated from the point of view of a young lieutenant, <i>Killing Rommel</i> brings to life the flair, agility, and daring of this extraordinary secret unit, the Long Range Desert Group. Stealthy and lethal as the scorpion that serves as their insignia, they live by their motto: <i>Non Vi Sed Arte</i>&#x2014;<i>Not by Strength, by Guile</i> as they gather intelligence, set up ambushes, and execute raids. <i>Killing Rommel </i>chronicles the tactics, weaponry, and specialized skills needed for combat, under extreme desert conditions. And it captures the camaraderie of this &#x201c;band of brothers&#x201d; as they perform the acts of courage and cunning crucial to the Allies&#x2019; victory in North Africa. <br><br>As in all of his previous novels, Pressfield powerfully renders the drama and intensity of warfare, the bonds of men in close combat, and the surprising human emotions and frailties that come into play on the battlefield. A vivid and authoritative depiction of the desert war, <i>Killing Rommel</i> brilliantly dramatizes an aspect of World War II that hasn&#x2019;t been in the limelight since <i>Patton</i>. Combining scrupulous historical detail and accuracy with remarkable narrative momentum, this galvanizing novel heralds Pressfield&#x2019;s gift for bringing more recent history to life.</p><p>It is Autumn, 1942.

In these stories, we find men or women -- sometimes at odds with themselves, sometimes transcendently well grounded -- who have an experience that is profound, unsettling, and oddly liberating. In "Empira's Tapestry." a gravely ill woman begins to weave a luminous cloth in which is expressed all of the fervent desire she had for her life ... In "Homecoming," a botanist has become so caught up with his academic ambitions that he forgets the names of the wildflowers in his own woods until his young daughter re-teaches him ... And in "The Entreaty of the Wiideema," an anthropologist traveling with an aboriginal people finds that, because of his aggressive desire to understand them, they remain for him always disturbingly unknowable.<br><br>These spare, haunting fictions, building cumulatively on each other, are marked by those qualities we have found in all of Barry Lopez's writing: a sense of the magic and marvelous strangeness of the world, respect for disparate ways of knowing and being, compassion for the human predicament, and a vibrant hope that comes from being alert and attentive to the complex beauties of landscape.<br><br>Field Votes is the final book of a loosely connected trilogy that includes Desert Notes (1976) and River Notes (1979) and stands with the best of Barry Lopez's remarkably varied work.</p><p>Barry Lopez won the 1986 National Book Award in nonfiction for Arctic Dreams.

His name was James Teal. He drove in when trillium were in full flower, April of 1954, in a green 1946 Dodge and stayed first for several weeks at the Courtyard Motel in Ordell before moving up onto the Bennett.<br><br>He brought no remarkable possessions. He walked with a slight limp, which my father thought might be from a war wound. He was tall, lean, his face vaguely Asiatic. I remember people noticed right away that he was not an intruder, and was easy to speak to. For a stranger who didn't have a job, or a way of life that fit him anywhere, he drew remarkably little suspicion in Ordell. Days, he was out of town in his car--people saw him walking in and out of the woods at different places; evenings he spent around the motel. He ate supper at Dan and Ruella's cafe or the Vincent Hotel. He didn't go into the bars. He bought groceries, like everyone, at Clyde's on Assiniboine--that's long gone now--and bought rope and pipe and things at Cassidy's Feed, which had a hardware section back then.<br><br>People like my father who always watched everything just a little said they saw less of him as summer went on. I don't remember, really, seeing much of him myself. I was infatuated with Esther Matthews and I missed a lot then, I suppose. But by the end of summer, August, he was gone.<br><br>After that, from the winter of '54--'55 on, he lived up on the Bennett. He gave the Dodge over to Wilton Haskin, who owned the Courtyard--some say he traded the car for rent or tools or meals, but if he did it was Wilton who likely got the better end of the deal. Wilton drove the car until he died in the fall of 1975. Then his son Clarence drove it another ten years.<br><br>Teal lived in two places I knew of on tributaries off the Bennett. One was at Cougar Creek and the other was on Lesley Creek, though for some reason then we called it White Dog Creek and now, like myself, some people call it Teal Creek.<br><br>Teal understood very well how to get on alone up there. He found spots where hot springs surfaced near south-facing benches, where he had light enough for a garden--which meant he looked the country over more closely than anyone I ever knew, or heard of. I was only inside the second cabin he built, but the first one must have been much like it, tight and simple. He broke and moved a lot of rock at the second place, a terrible amount of work, really, to make a good foundation for a one-room cabin. And he built a flume there at the second place, a wood chute to carry the flow of water from the hot spring through at floor level. He packed a woodstove in and had creek water, and he built a porch big enough to cover some of his firewood and a daybed.<br><br>I was thirteen the summer he moved up on Cougar Creek. I didn't go up that way to hunt or wander or fool around. No one did. At the time all the country around there was so open, so empty of people, no one much kept him in mind. He wasn't any trespasser. It was all federal land. We would see him in town once or twice, early in the spring or late in summer. He'd work a few weeks for Wilton, buy staples at Clyde's, and then hitch back out to Bennett River. From the highway he'd walk up Cougar Creek to his place or, later, the four miles up White Dog Creek.<br><br>Those times he'd hitch back out of town, once I got my license, I'd think about offering him a ride. He was the most beguiling person to me, beckoning, like the first pungent smell of cottonwood buds. He seemed as independent and benign as the moon. But I was shy and my father disapproved of that kind of curiosity.<br><br>I went away to college in '59. Summers I worked with my father, a heavy-equipment contractor. In the summer after my junior year we were building logging roads back up from the Bennett. One night, halfway home, I missed my wallet and turned the truck around, certain it had fallen out at the work site. I found it on the ground alongside the grader I was driving. By then it was after seven, but the sky was still bright, and I got to thinking about James Teal. Without knowing why, without really looking at what I was doing, I pulled off the road at Lesley Creek bridge and sat there. I wanted to see his place. I wanted to talk with him. Where did he come from? What sort of things did he work at? Did he have a family somewhere? I wondered if he was purely white, but I wouldn't admit to the rank curiosity, the willingness to invade his privacy. I'd never had a conversation with the man. I had no reason at all to be calling.<br><br>Still, that evening I went up the creek. Dusk was long enough to see by for a few hours and I carried a flashlight to come back. I walked along a deer trail, just a few yards into the trees, a narrow path cushioned with moss and fir needles. No stranger would guess a man occasionally passed there.<br><br>It was dark when I finally descried the cabin. I saw its angles silhouetted in trees against the sky. Teal was standing on the porch, looking into the woods, but not toward me. In hearth or candle light I saw he wore a white T-shirt tucked in his trousers and that he was barefoot. I squatted down on the trail. Two Swainson's thrushes were calling, back and forth. After a while they were quiet and Teal went in. I heard the door close, the metal latch fall.<br><br>I felt foolish and at the same time a little frightened. I'd come all this way, then said nothing, and had hidden from the man. I couldn't understand why I was scared, but I got so dizzy I had to sit. I felt myself in a kind of sinkhole in the darkness. I knew if I walked up to the cabin and spoke to him I'd be all right. But I turned back on the deer trail. My skin prickled. I ran fast, imagining feral dogs chasing me down. I tangled in limbs and blackberry vines. All the way out to the road I felt an edge of panic.<br><br>At the truck I calmed myself. It wasn't Teal that had frightened me. It wasn't the dark, either. What scared me was the thought that I might have injured him. I knew right then what it meant to trespass.<br><br>Late in the summer of 1967, I moved back to Ordell and went to work full-time for my father. I had married a woman named Julie Quiros from Stuart River. I'd finished four years in the army, none of it, I've always been grateful, in Vietnam, and we'd had a daughter, Blair. My mother's younger brother, despondent, involved with another woman, had shot himself and his wife, and their three children, all girls, had come to live with my parents. Clyde Brennan had closed his store and another market had opened up.<br><br>Teal, like the first wildly colored harlequin duck I ever saw, had been somewhere at the edge of my thoughts all that time, ever since that night. When I got home I asked my father if he'd seen him recently. He said yes, Teal had been in town that August, had worked a little for Wilton, the same as always, then he'd gone back out to his place--and certainly, whether it was federal land or not, it was his place by now.<br><br>What could he believe in? I wondered. What allowed him to be comfortable out there from one year to the next? Whatever his beliefs were, he didn't bother anybody with them. Whenever he came to town he got on easily with people. I remember even a few times he played softball with us, laughing as much as anyone when he dropped easy pop flies or struck out. Did he keep a tidy shelf of books up there? And which books would those be? Did he reel and crouch in the moon's light?<br><br>Though I'd never done so as a boy, I knew there were spots along the Bennett good to swim in, and on an Indian summer day in September of '67 I took Julie and Blair up to a place past Teal Creek. They swam. I couldn't keep my attention on them. I felt my unseemly curiosity, the cowardice and insistence of it, and I knew Julie was aware that something was running in my mind.<br><br>I looked over at her, at the soft, veined line of her neck, where it rose from her shoulders.<br><br>"You know that fellow Teal?" I asked.<br><br>"The hermit?"<br><br>"I don't know, really." After a while I said, "When I was fourteen, a man named Ephraim Lincoln told all of us a story about Teal, one morning at Clyde's during hunting season. He said he found where Teal had walked barefoot in the snow and seen where he'd knelt down for a long time by a little waterfall, then lay out full, naked. I shook my head and laughed right along with the older men, but everyone knew that the scorn was wrong, misdirected. It was Ephraim who was lewd, a corrupt individual.<br><br>"Ever since then, I've known I wanted to protect Teal. And that I should--that I'm meant to--receive something from him. I don't know what it is."<br><br>Julie rested her fingers on my arm.<br><br>That fall instead of going up Enid River to look for deer with a friend I went alone up the Bennett. I planned to walk in along Cougar Creek and just roam around. If I saw Teal's first cabin, well, fine. I'd look it over. I knew I wouldn't shoot any deer up there, no matter. It would have been wrong, mixing those things.<br><br>I got about a mile up Cougar Creek and then knew I shouldn't be in there. I turned back, feeling a familiar dread and misgiving. Then, a short way down the trail, I was fine. It occurred to me that maybe Teal was dealing with menace, that out here he went chin to chin with an evil I could not imagine. The knowledge that he might do this shamed me. Where was my own courage, my own resolution?<br><br>That winter I began reading to Blair at night. We started off with fairy tales, but the most interesting stories to us after a while were Indian stories, ones collected by George Bird Grinnell and James Willard Schultz from Cheyenne and Blackfeet and Gros Ventre people not so far away, over in Montana and Wyoming. At first I thought Blair would be bored. The stories were mostly about young men traveling, or about the creation of the world. But she liked them. The stories were simple, without ir...</p><h2>To be the Man (WWE)</h2><p>One of the biggest wrestling superstars of the past 20 years, and one of the greatest champions of all time, Ric Flair has carved out a legacy for himself that will never be surpassed.

The story follows typical folkloric patterns as it tells of a wise and kindly king whose problems are solved by a poor but resourceful boy. In this case, King Balash's troubles stem from the theft of a large diamond that used to fill his palace with light. Payam, an apprentice weaver, finds the shards that remain where the thief dropped the gem. He persuades the king to rule for one year and a day while he, his fellow apprentices, and the master work together to create a magnificent carpet that will once again bring light and color to his home. The task, of course, is accomplished, and a happy ending is assured. Ewart's glowing illustrations in deep jewel tones are well suited to the text and capture something of the exotic flavor of ancient Persia's craftsmanship. An attractive collaboration that deserves a place in many libraries.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Children who've been told of the diamond's legendary hardness may question the ease with which this one is shattered. A king, accustomed to dwelling in a light-filled room where a large diamond creates a million rainbows, is bereft when it's stolen and smashed, and thereafter takes his only pleasure in staring at the fragments, away from the subjects who need him. An apprentice weaver comes up with the idea of making a magnificent carpet that will lure the king back to his duties. It works. But, unfortunately, neither the words nor the art here convincingly suggests the lure of the diamond's prismatic play or the carpet's intricate patterns. Readers will have to take these on faith. Still, Ewart's illustrations are prettily evocative of old Persia, and perhaps the tale will pique interest in this ancient art form. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A hot time of day, at a hot time of year, in a hot part of the country. The town squats on the shoulder of the road from Mojave to L.A. Due west, the southern rump of the Coastal Range Mountains is visible. Due east, the Mojave Desert disappears into the haze. Very little happens in Laney. After that Monday in the middle of June thirteen years ago, even less ever did.</p> <p>There was one industry in Laney. One factory. A big spread of a place. Weathered metal siding, built in the sixties. Office accommodations at the north end, in the shade. The first floor was low grade. Clerical functions took place there. Billing and accounting and telephone calling. The second story was high grade. Managers. The corner office on the right used to be the personnel manager's place. Now it was the human resources manager's place. Same guy, new title on his door.</p> <p>Outside that door in the long second-floor corridor was a line of chairs. The human resources manager's secretary had rustled them up and placed them there that Monday morning. The line of chairs was occupied by a line of men and women. They were silent. Every five minutes the person at the head of the line would be called into the office. The rest of them would shuffle up one place. They didn't speak. They didn't need to. They knew what was happening.</p> <p>Just before one o'clock, James Penney shuffled up one space to the head of the line. He waited five long minutes and stood up when he was called. Stepped into the office. Closed the door behind him. The human resources manager was a guy called Odell. Odell hadn't been long out of diapers when James Penney started work at the Laney plant.</p> <p>"Mr. Penney," Odell said.</p> <p>Penney said nothing, but sat down and nodded in a guarded way.</p> <p>"We need to share some information with you," Odell said. Penney shrugged at him. He knew what was coming. He heard things, same as anybody else.</p> <p>"Just give me the short version, okay?" he said.</p> <p>Odell nodded. "We're laying you off."</p> <p>"For the summer?" Penney asked him.</p> <p>Odell shook his head.</p> <p>"For good," he said.</p> <p>Penney took a second to get over the sound of the words. He'd known they were coming, but they hit him like they were the last words he ever expected Odell to say.</p> <p>"Why?" he asked.</p> <p>Odell shrugged. He didn't look as if he was enjoying this. But on the other hand, he didn't look as if it was upsetting him much, either.</p> <p>"Downsizing," he said. "No option. Only way we can go."</p> <p>"Why?" Penney said again. <br>Odell leaned back in his chair and folded his hands behind his head. Started the speech he'd already made many times that day.</p> <p>"We need to cut costs," he said. "This is an expensive operation. Small margin. Shrinking market. You know that."</p> <p>Penney stared into space and listened to the silence breaking through from the factory floor. "So you're closing the plant?"</p> <p>Odell shook his head again. "We're downsizing, is all. The plant will stay open. There'll be some maintenance. Some repairs, overhauls. But not like it used to be."</p> <p>"The plant will stay open?" Penney said. "So how come you're letting me go?"</p> <p>Odell shifted in his chair. Pulled his hands from behind his head and folded his arms across his chest defensively. He had reached the tricky part of the interview.</p> <p>"It's a question of the skills mix," he said. "We had to pick a team with the correct blend. We put a lot of work into the decision. And I'm afraid you didn't make the cut."</p> <p>"What's wrong with my skills?" Penney asked. "I got skills. I've worked here seventeen years. What's wrong with my damn skills?"</p> <p>"Nothing at all," Odell said. "But other people are better. We have to look at the big picture. It's going to be a skeleton crew, so we need the best skills, the fastest learners, good attendance records, you know how it is."</p> <p>"Attendance records?" Penney said. "What's wrong with my attendance record? I've worked here seventeen years. You saying I'm not a reliable worker?"</p> <p>Odell touched the brown file folder in front of him. "You've had a lot of time out sick," he said. "Absentee rate just above eight percent."</p> <p>Penney looked at him incredulously. "Sick?" he said. "I wasn't sick. I was post-traumatic. From Vietnam."</p> <p>Odell shook his head again. He was too young. "Whatever," he said. "That's still a big absentee rate."</p> <p>James Penney just sat there, stunned. He felt like he'd been hit by a train.</p> <p>"We looked for the correct blend," Odell said again. "We put a lot of management time into the process. We're confident we made the right decisions. You're not being singled out. We're losing eighty percent of our people."</p> <p>Penney stared across at him. "You staying?"</p> <p>Odell nodded and tried to hide a smile but couldn't. "There's still a business to run," he said. "We still need management."</p> <p>There was silence in the corner office. Outside, the hot breeze stirred off the desert and blew a listless eddy over the metal building. Odell opened the brown folder and pulled out a blue envelope. Handed it across the desk.</p> <p>"You're paid up to the end of July," he said. "Money went in the bank this morning. Good luck, Mr. Penney."</p> <p>The five-minute interview was over. Odell's secretary appeared and opened the door to the corridor. Penney walked out. The secretary called the next man in. Penney walked past the long quiet row of people and made it to the parking lot. Slid into his car. It was a red Firebird, a year and a half old, and it wasn't paid for yet. He started it up and drove the mile to his house. Eased to a stop in his driveway and sat there, thinking, in a daze, with the engine running.</p> <p>He was imagining the repo men coming for his car. The only damn thing in his whole life he'd ever really wanted. He remembered the exquisite joy of buying it. After his divorce. Waking up and realizing he could just go to the dealer, sign the papers and have it. No discussions. No arguing. He'd gone down to the dealer and chopped in his old clunker and signed up for that Firebird and driven it home in a state of total joy. He'd washed it every week. He'd watched the infomercials and tried every miracle polish on the market. The car had sat every day outside the Laney factory like a bright red badge of achievement. Like a shiny consolation for the shit and the drudgery. Whatever else he didn't have, he had a Firebird.</p> <p>He felt a desperate fury building inside him. He got out of the car and ran to the garage and grabbed his spare can of gasoline. Ran back to the house. Opened the door. Emptied the can over the sofa. He couldn't find a match, so he lit the gas stove in the kitchen and unwound a roll of paper towels. Put one end on the stove top and ran the rest through to the living room. When his makeshift fuse was well alight, he skipped out to his car and started it up. Turned north toward Mojave.</p> <p>His neighbor noticed the fire when the flames started coming through the roof. She called the Laney fire department. The fire-fighters didn't respond. It was a volunteer department, and all the volunteers were in line inside the factory, upstairs in the narrow corridor. Then the warm air moving off the Mojave Desert freshened up into a hot breeze, and by the time James Penney was thirty miles away the flames from his house had set fire to the dried scrub that had been his lawn. By the time he was in the town of Mojave itself, cashing his last paycheck at the bank, the flames had spread across his lawn and his neighbor's and were licking at the base of her back porch.</p> <p>Like any California boomtown, Laney had grown in a hurry. The factory had been thrown up around the start of Nixon's first term. A hundred acres of orange groves had been bulldozed and five hundred frame houses had quadrupled the population in a year. There was nothing really wrong with the houses, but they'd seen rain less than a dozen times in the thirty-one years they'd been standing, and they were about as dry as houses can get. Their timbers had sat and baked in the sun and been scoured by the dry desert winds. There were no hydrants built into the streets. The houses were close together, and there were no wind-breaks. But there had never been a serious fire in Laney. Not until that Monday in June.</p> <p>James Penney's neighbor called the fire department for the second time after her back porch disappeared in flames. The fire department was in disarray. The dispatcher advised her to get out of her house and just wait for their arrival. By the time the fire truck got there, her house was destroyed. And the next house in line was destroyed, too. The desert breeze had blown the fire on across the second narrow gap and sent the old couple living there scuttling into the street for safety. Then Laney called in the fire departments from Lancaster and Glendale and Bakersfield, and they arrived with proper equipment and saved the day. They hosed the scrub between the houses and the blaze went no farther. Just three houses destroyed, Penney's and his two down-wind neighbors. Within two hours the panic was over, and by the time Penney himself was fifty miles north of Mojave, Laney's sheriff was working with the fire investigators to piece together what had happened.</p> <p>They started with Penney's place, which was the upwind house, and the first to burn, and therefore the coolest. It had just about burned down to the floor slab, but the layout was still clear. And the evidence was there to see. There was tremendous scorching on one side of where the living room had been. The Glendale investigator recognized it as something he'd seen many times before. It was what is left when a foam-filled sofa or armchair is doused with gasoline and set afire. As clear a case of arson as he had ever seen. The unfortunate wild cards had been the stiffening desert breeze and the proximity of the other houses.</p> <p>Then the sheriff had gone looking for James Penney, to tell him somebody had burned his house down, and his neighbors'. He drove his black-and-white to the factory and walked upstairs, past the long line of people and into Odell's corner office. Odell told him what had happened in the five-minute interview just after one o'clock. Then the sheriff had driven back to the Laney station house, steering with one hand and rubbing his chin with the other.</p> <p>And by the time James Penney was driving along the towering eastern flank of Mount Whitney, a hundred and fifty miles from home, there was an all-points-bulletin out on him, suspicion of deliberate arson, which in the dry desert heat of southern California was a big, big deal.</p> <p>The next morning's sun woke James Penney by coming in through a hole in his motel-room blind and playing a bright beam across his face. He stirred and lay in the warmth of the rented bed, watching the dust motes dancing.</p> <p>He was still in California, up near Yosemite, in a place just far enough from the park to be cheap. He had six weeks' pay in his billfold, which was hidden under the center of his mattress. Six weeks' pay, less a tank and a half of gas, a cheeseburger and twenty-seven-fifty for the room. Hidden under the mattress, because twenty-seven-fifty doesn't get you a space in a top-notch place. His door was locked, but the desk guy would have a passkey, and he wouldn't be the first desk guy in the world to rent out his passkey by the hour to somebody looking to make a little extra money during the night.</p> <p>But nothing bad had happened. The mattress was so thin he could feel the billfold right there, under his kidney. Still there, still bulging. A good feeling. He lay watching the sunbeam, struggling with mental arithmetic, spreading six weeks' pay out over the foreseeable future. With nothing to worry about except cheap food, cheap motels and the Firebird's gas, he figured he had no problems at all. The Firebird had a modern engine, twenty-four valves, tuned for a blend of power and economy. He could get far away and have enough money left to take his time looking around.</p> <p>After that, he wasn't so sure. But there would be a call for something. He was sure of that. Even if it was menial. He was a worker. Maybe he'd find something outdoors, might be a refreshing thing. Might have some kind of dignity to it. Some kind of simple work, for simple honest folks, a lot different than slaving for that grinning weasel Odell.</p> <p>He watched the sunbeam travel across the counterpane for a while. Then he flung the cover aside and swung himself out of bed. Used the john, rinsed his face and mouth at the sink and untangled his clothes from the pile he'd dropped them in. He'd need more clothes. He only had the things he stood up in. Everything else he'd burned along with his house. He shrugged and reran his calculations to allow for some new pants and work shirts. Maybe some heavy boots, if he was going to be laboring outside. The six weeks' pay was going to have to stretch a little thinner. He decided to drive slow, to save gas and maybe eat less. Or maybe not less, just cheaper. He'd use truck stops, not tourist diners. More calories, less money.</p> <p>He figured today he'd put in some serious miles before stopping for breakfast. He jingled the car keys in his pocket and opened his cabin door. Then he stopped. His heart thumped. The blacktop rectangle outside his cabin was empty. Just old oil stains staring up at him. He glanced desperately left and right along the row. No red Firebird. He staggered back into the room and sat down heavily on the bed. Just sat there in a daze, thinking about what to do.</p> <p>He decided he wouldn't bother with the desk guy. He was pretty certain the desk guy was responsible. He could just about see it. The guy had waited an hour and then called some buddies who had come over and hot-wired his car. Eased it out of the motel lot and away down the road. A conspiracy, feeding off unsuspecting motel traffic. Feeding off suckers dumb enough to pay twenty-seven-fifty for the privilege of getting their prize possession stolen. He was numb. Suspended somewhere between sick and raging. His red Firebird. Gone. Stolen. No repo men involved. Just thieves.</p> <p>The nearest police station was two miles south. He had seen it the previous night, heading north past it. It was small but crowded. He stood in line behind five other people. There was an officer behind the counter, taking details, taking complaints, writing slow. Penney felt like every minute was vital. He felt like his Firebird was racing down to the border. Maybe this guy could radio ahead and get it stopped. He hopped from foot to foot in frustration. Gazed wildly around him. There were notices stuck on a board behind the officer's head. Blurred Xeroxes of telexes and faxes. U.S. Marshal notices. A mass of stuff. His eyes flicked absently across it all.</p> <p>Then they snapped back. His photograph was staring out at him. The photograph from his own driver's license, Xeroxed in black and white, enlarged, grainy. His name underneath, in big printed letters. JAMES PENNEY. From Laney, California. A description of his car. Red Firebird. The plate number. James Penney. Wanted for arson and criminal damage. He stared at the bulletin. It grew larger and larger. It grew life-size. His face stared back at him like he was looking in a mirror. James Penney. Arson. Criminal damage. All-points-bulletin. The woman in front of him finished her business and he stepped forward to the head of the line. The desk sergeant looked up at him.</p></p><h2>Knife of Dreams</h2><p>Knife of Dreams by Robert Jordan.

Each couple is awaiting the arrival of an adopted infant daughter from Korea.

Somehow this big American takes up so much space that the orderly boundaries of her life feel invaded.<br><br>A luminous novel brimming with subtle, funny, and tender observations that cast a penetrating light on the American way as seen from two perspectives, those who are born here and those who are still struggling to fit in.</p><p>Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis in 1941 but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. She graduated at nineteen from Duke University and went on to do graduate work in Russian studies at Columbia University. This is Anne Tyler&#x2019;s seventeenth novel; her eleventh, <i>Breathing Lessons</i>, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. She is a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She lives in Baltimore.At eight o'clock in the evening, the Baltimore airport was nearly deserted. The wide gray corridors were empty, and the newsstands were dark, and the coffee shops were closed. Most of the gates had admitted their last flights. Their signboards were blank and their rows of vinyl chairs unoccupied and ghostly.<br><br> But you could hear a distant hum, a murmur of anticipation, at the far end of Pier D. You could see an overexcited child spinning herself into dizziness in the center of the corridor, and then a grownup popping forth to scoop her up and carry her, giggling and squirming, back into the waiting area. And a latecomer, a woman in a yellow dress, was rushing toward the gate with an armful of long-stemmed roses.<br><br> Step around the bend, then, and you'd come upon what looked like a gigantic baby shower. The entire waiting area for the flight from San Francisco was packed with people bearing pink- and blue-wrapped gifts, or hanging on to flotillas of silvery balloons printed with IT'S A GIRL! and trailing spirals of pink ribbon. A man gripped the wicker handle of a wheeled and skirted bassinet as if he planned to roll it onto the plane, and a woman stood ready with a stroller so chrome-trimmed and bristling with levers that it seemed capable of entering the Indy 500. At least half a dozen people held video cameras, and many more had regular cameras slung around their necks. A woman spoke into a tape recorder in an urgent, secretive way. The man next to her clasped an infant's velour-upholstered car seat close to his chest.<br><br> MOM, the button on the woman's shoulder read--one of those man's read DAD. A nice-looking couple, not as young as you might expect--the woman in wide black pants and an arty black-and-white top of a geometric design, her short hair streaked with gray; the man a big, beaming, jovial type with a stubbly blond buzz cut, his bald knees poking bashfully from voluminous khaki Bermudas.<br><br> And not only were there MOM and DAD; there were GRANDMA and GRANDPA, twice over--two complete sets. One grandma was a rumpled, comfortable woman in a denim sundress and bandanna-print baseball cap; the other was thin and gilded and expertly made up, wearing an ecru linen pantsuit and dyed-to-match pumps. The grandpas were dyed to match as well--the rumpled woman's husband equally rumpled, his iron-gray curls overdue for a cutting, while the gilded woman's husband wore linen trousers and some sort of gauzy tropical shirt, and part of his bright yellow hair was possibly not his own.<br><br> It's true there were other people waiting, people clearly not included in the celebration. A weary-eyed woman in curlers; an older woman with a younger one who might have been her daughter; a father with two small children already dressed in pajamas. These outsiders stood around the edges, quiet and somehow dimmed, from time to time sneaking glances in the direction of MOM and DAD.<br><br> The plane was late. People grew restless. A child pointed out accusingly that the arrivals board still read ON TIME--a plain old lie. Several teenagers wandered off to the unlit waiting area just across the corridor. A little girl in pigtails fell asleep on a vinyl chair, the button on her green plaid blouse proclaiming COUSIN.<br><br> Then something changed. There wasn't any announcement--the PA system had been silent for some time--but people gradually stopped talking and pressed toward the jetway, craning their necks, standing on tiptoe. A woman in a uniform punched in a code and swung open the jetway door. A skycap arrived with a wheelchair. The teenagers reappeared. MOM and DAD, till now in the very center of the crowd, were nudged forward with encouraging pats, a path magically widening to let them approach the door.<br><br> First off was a very tall young man in jeans, wearing the confused look of someone who'd been flying too long. He spotted the mother and daughter and went over to them and bent to kiss the daughter, but only on the cheek because she was too busy peering past him, just briefly returning his hug while she kept her eyes on the new arrivals.<br><br> Two businessmen with briefcases, striding purposefully toward the terminal. A teenage boy with a backpack so huge that he resembled an ant with an oversized breadcrumb. Another businessman. Another teenage boy, this one claimed by the woman in curlers. A smiling, rosy-cheeked redhead instantly engulfed by the two children in pajamas.<br><br> Now a pause. A sort of gathering of focus.<br><br> A crisply dressed Asian woman stepped through the door with a baby. This baby was perhaps five or six months old--able to hold herself confidently upright. She had a cushiony face and a head of amazingly thick black hair, cut straight across her forehead and straight across the tops of her ears, and she wore a footed pink sleeper. "Ah!" everyone breathed--even the outsiders, even the mother and the grown daughter. (Although the daughter's young man still appeared confused.) The mother-to-be stretched out both arms, letting her tape recorder bounce at the end of its strap. But the Asian woman stopped short in an authoritative manner that warded off any approach. She drew herself up and said, "Donaldson?"<br><br> "Donaldson. That's us," the father-to-be said. His voice was shaking. He had somehow got rid of the car seat, passed it blindly to someone or other, but he stayed slightly to the rear of his wife and kept one hand on her back as if in need of support.<br><br> "Congratulations," the Asian woman said. "This is Jin-Ho." She transferred the baby to the mother's waiting arms, and then she unhitched a pink diaper bag from her shoulder and handed it to the father. The mother buried her face in the crook of the baby's neck. The baby stayed upright, gazing calmly out at the crowd. "Ah," people kept saying, and "Isn't she a cutie!" and "Did you ever see such a doll?"<br><br> Flashbulbs, insistent video cameras, everyone pressing too close. The father's eyes were wet. Lots of people's were; there were sniffing sounds all through the waiting area and noses being blown. And when the mother raised her face, finally, her cheeks were sheeted with tears. "Here," she told the father. "You hold her."<br><br> "Aw, no, I'm scared I might . . . You do it, honey. I'll watch."<br><br> The Asian woman started riffling through a sheaf of papers. People still disembarking had to step around her, step around the little family and the well-wishers and the tangle of baby equipment. Luckily, the flight hadn't been a full one. The passengers arrived in spurts: man with a cane, pause; retired couple, pause . . .<br><br> And then another Asian woman, younger than the first and plainer, with a tucked, apologetic way of looking about. She was lugging a bucket-shaped infant carrier by the handle, and you could tell that the baby inside must not weigh all that much. This baby, too, was a girl, if you could judge by the pink T-shirt, but she was smaller than the first one, sallow and pinched, with fragile wisps of black hair trailing down her forehead. Like the young woman transporting her, she showed a sort of anxious interest in the crowd. Her watchful black eyes moved too quickly from face to face.<br><br> The young woman said something that sounded like "Yaz-dun?"<br><br> "Yaz-dan," a woman called from the rear. It sounded like a correction. The crowd parted again, not certain which way to move but eager to be of help, and three people no one had noticed before approached in single file: a youngish couple, foreign-looking, olive-skinned and attractive, followed by a slim older woman with a chignon of sleek black hair knotted low on the nape of her neck. It must have been she who had called out their name, because now she called it again in the same clear, carrying voice. "Here we are. Yazdan." There was just the trace of an accent evident in the ruffled r's.<br><br> The young woman turned to face them, holding the carrier awkwardly in front of her. "Congratulations, this is Sooki," she said, but so softly and so breathlessly that people had to ask each other, "What?" "Who did she say?" "Sooki, I believe it was." "Sooki! Isn't that sweet!"<br><br> There was a problem unfastening the straps that held the baby in her carrier. The new parents had to do it because the Asian woman's hands were full, and the parents were flustered and unskilled--the mother laughing slightly and tossing back her explosive waterfall of hennaed curls, the father biting his lip and looking vexed with himself. He wore tiny, very clean rimless glasses that glittered as he angled first this way and then that, struggling with a plastic clasp. The grandmother, if that was who she was, made sympathetic tsk-tsking sounds.<br><br> But at last the baby was free. Such a little bit of a thing! The father plucked her out in a gingerly, arm's-length manner and handed her to the mother, who gathered her in and rocked her and pressed her cheek against the top of the baby's feathery black head. The baby quirked her eyebrows but offered no resistance. Onlookers were blowing their noses again, and the father had to take off his glasses and wipe the lenses, but the mother and the grandmother stayed dry-eyed, smiling and softly murmuring. They paid no attention to the crowd. When someone asked, "Is yours from Korea too?" neither woman answered, and it was the father, finally, who said, "Hmm? Oh. Yes, she is."<br><br> "Hear that, Bitsy and Brad? Here's another Korean baby!"<br><br> The first mother glanced around--she was allowing the two grandmas a closer inspection--and said, "Really?" Her husband echoed her: "Really!&amp;quo...</p><h2>Science With Water (Science Activities)</h2><p>Presents experiments which demonstrate the properties of water, and discusses water power, ice, evaporation, and surface tension.</p><p></p><h2>When the Light Goes: A Novel</h2><p>A sequel to Duane&#39;s Depressed by the Oscar-winning screenplay writer for Brokeback Mountain finds widower Duane Moore returning to west Texas, where he finds the family oil business significantly altered by new personnel, evolving family dynamics, and his own perspective changes. 150,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>. His other works include two collections of essays, three memoirs, and more than thirty screenplays, including the coauthorship of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, for which he received an Academy Award. He lives in Archer City, Texas.In his now-classic debut novel, <i>The Last Picture Show</i>(1966), McMurtry introduced readers to a dying Texas town called Thalia and a lively teenager named Duane Moore. McMurtry revisited both in his novels <i>Texasville</i> (1987) and <i>Duane's Depressed</i> (1999), rendering Duane as a sort of West Texas equivalent of Updike's Rabbit Angstrom. McMurtry's latest novel begins with Duane, now 65, returning from an overseas sabbatical designed to relieve his grief for his deceased wife. He finds that his life in Thalia has receded; his children have all moved on, his oil company is successful without him, and he is utterly alone. In walks Annie, a young blond and new employee at the company. Annie flirts with Duane but soon reveals that--despite her 27 years--she knows almost nothing about sex. Duane hasn't learned much either but is willing to share his meager education with Annie. McMurtry keeps the sexual play frank--too frank, with descriptions of Duane's impotence falling under the heading of <i>too</i> <i>much information</i> Although Duane is surprised by his late-blooming sexuality, readers won't be, and his prolonged malaise deadens the impact of his self-discovery. Still, it's nice to know what ultimately becomes of old Duane--even if it isn't particularly enthralling. <i>Jerry Eberle</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Companion to <i>The Revelation of Jesus Christ</i>, this major contribution to prophetic research emphasizes the value and genuineness of Daniel. It considers alleged historical inaccuracies, difficult-to-interpret phrases, apocryphal additions, major textual problems, use of Persian and Greek words, historical background of Bible events, and past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies. <i>Daniel</i> goes beyond a mere presentation of the author's interpretation of Old Testament prophecy. It quotes Bible scholars from different corners of the theological ring to help the reader discover the meaning of Scripture for himself. Unusually thorough and well outlined, this commentary captures the heartbeat of a young prophet who spoke boldly for God.</p><p><b>JOHN F.

Three decades later, the shock waves from the Iranian Revolution are still being felt around the globe [and] we are rapidly approaching the most dangerous moment in the history of the Iranian Revolution. Iran&#39;s senior leaders have stated publicly that the end of the world is &#34;imminent..,.&#34;They are feverishly trying to build, buy or steal nuclear weapons....Iran, however, is not the only threat. Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network remain a clear and present danger to U.S. national security.... What the Radicals need most is Western ignorance, apathy, and lack of moral clarity. If the West can be lulled to sleep...then the Radicals will soon be able to pull off a series of attacks that make 9/11 pale by comparison and could leave millions dead. The Followers of Jefferson: &#34;Aren&#39;t there any Muslims out there who think the Radicals are crazy and are willing to fight back against the jihadists?&#34; I am often asked. &#34;Where are the Muslim leaders who are promoting freedom and opportunity and trying to create and expand democracy, as difficult as that may be in the modern Middle East?.,.&#34;Here are the answers: &#34;Yes, absolutely,&#34; and &#34;They&#39;re out there, but they don&#39;t get nearly enough attention..,.&#34;While not all Reformers are full-blown &#34;Jeffersonian democrats,&#34; a growing number of Muslim leaders are, in fact, seeking to follow and emulate Thomas Jefferson&#39;s teachings and example....And they are not simply talking about the power of representative government; they are actually gaining real political power and wielding game-changing influence in criticalcountries in the Middle East. The Followers of Jesus: You rarely hear about it on the news. But the big, untold story is that more Muslims are coming to faith in Jesus Christ today than at any other time in human history....During the course of interviewing more than 150 Christian leaders in the epicenter, I have been able to assemble enough data and anecdotal evidence to paint a picture of how powerfully the God of the Bible is moving to draw Muslims into His family....The head of one leading Iranian ministry told me: &#34;Based on all the things we are seeing inside Iran today, I personally believe that if every Iranian who secretly believes in Jesus could come forward right now and declare his or her faith publicly, the number would top a million.&#34;<p>GUERRAS Y RUMORES DE GUERRA En 1979, el Ayatola Khomeini tomo control del gobierno de Iran, desato la Revolucion Islamica y permitio que sus seguidores tomaran la Embajada Estadounidense en Teheran con 52 personas como rehenes durante 444 dias.

The audacious effort was undertaken with the cover of an undersea mining operation sponsored by eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes. Azorian incorrectly identified as Project Jennifer by the press was the most ambitious ocean engineering endeavor attempted by man. It can be compared to the 1969 moon landing in its level of technological achievement. Following the accidental sinking of a Soviet missile submarine in March 1968, U.S. intelligence agencies were able to determine the precise location and to develop a means of raising the submarine from a depth of 16,560 feet. Previously, the deepest attempt to salvage a submarine had been accomplished at 245 feet. The remarkable salvage effort of the K-129, which contained nuclear-armed torpedoes and missiles as well as crypto equipment, was conducted with Soviet naval ships a few hundred yards from the lift ship, the Hughes Glomar Explorer. While other books have been published about this secret project, not one was based on interviews with the participants or on classified government documents. The authors conducted interviews with men who were on board the Glomar Explorer and the USS Halibut, the submarine that found the wreckage, with U.S. naval intelligence officers, and with the Soviet submarine division commander. The authors had access to the Glomar Explorer s logs and other documents from U.S. and Soviet sources. The book is based, in part, on the research for Michael White&#39;s documentary film Azorian: The Raising of the K-129, released in late 2009. The research for the book and the documentary forced the CIA to issue a report on Project Azorian in early 2010, with one-third of the document censored. In this book, the untold story of the CIA s Project Azorian is finally revealed after decades of secrecy.</p><p>In early August 1974, despite incredible risks and after six years of secret preparations, the CIA attempted to salvage the sunken Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129 from the depths of the North Pacific Ocean.

Why aren't more radio dramas like this? Perhaps because it's hard to write comedy as polished as Jonathan Lynn's and Antony Jay's in this classic British satire following a new government minister as he butts up against the entrenched civil service and the realities of political life. It's hard to tell who is being most severely critiqued. Is it complacent civil servants? Shallow, ignorant elected officials? The British public, who allow all this to go on? Thankfully, listeners don't have to decide. Instead, they can enjoy Paul Eddington's wonderful timing as Jim Hacker, Nigel Hawthorne's supercilious characterization of Sir Humphrey Appleby, and Derek Fowlds's precise portrait of Bernard Wooley. G.T.B. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>The British TV series Yes Minister (shown here on PBS) began as an innocuous spoof on the vagaries of politicians and civil servants. Its popularity increased as it developed a deepening satiric perception of how the British are actually governed: Ministers are kept in the dark by their civil service advisers as much as possible; their sole domain is "making policy," while the civil servants get on with running the country and making sure the politicians get the blame. In turning their scripts into a book, the authors have gone beyond a simple recounting of the episodes. Presented as actual memoirsthe diary of James Hacker, Minister for the Department of Administrative Affairs, augmented by material from his two civil service advisers, Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard WooleyYes Minister is an amusingly literate, sharply satirical account of the exchanges of quid pro quo necessary to run any government. The book surpasses its TV origins and stands firmly on its own merits. On the bestseller lists in England for over three years, this provocative satire could well be considered a British Doonesbury. 25,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Master storyteller Naguib Mahfouz crowns his best-selling <i>Cairo Trilogy</i> with this final chronicle of the Abdal-Jawad&nbsp;&nbsp;clan, climaxing the story begun in <i>Palace Walk</i> and continued in <i>Palace Of Desire</i>.</p><p>Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. A student of philosophy and an avid reader, his works range from reimaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Over a career that lasted more than five decades, he wrote 33 novels, 13 short story anthologies, numerous plays, and 30 screenplays. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of <b>Palace Walk</b> (1956), <b>Palace of Desire</b> (1957), and <b>Sugar Street</b> (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer in Arabic to do so. He died in August 2006.1<br><br>Their heads were huddled around the brazier, and their hands were spread over its fire: Amina's thin and gaunt, Aisha's stiff, and Umm Hanafi's like the shell of a turtle. The beautiful pure-white ones were Na'ima's. The January cold was almost severe enough to freeze water at the edges of the sitting room, which had retained its time-honored appearance with its colored mats and the sofas distributed around the sides. The old lantern with its oil lamp had vanished, and hanging in its place was an electric light. The location had changed too, for the coffee hour had returned to the first floor. Indeed the entire upper story had moved downstairs to make life easier for the father, whose heart was no longer strong enough for him to climb to the top.<br><br>The family members had changed as well. Amina's body had withered, and her hair had turned white. Although barely sixty, she looked ten years older, and her transformation was nothing compared to Aisha's decline and disintegration. It was ironic or pathetic that the daughter's hair was still golden and her eyes blue, when her listless glance gave no hint of life and her pale complexion seemed the symptom of some disease. With a protruding bone structure and sunken eyes and cheeks, her face hardly appeared that of a thirty-four-year-old woman. Although the years had settled on Umm Hanafi, they did not seem to have marked her in any essential way, hardly diminishing her reserves of flesh and fat. Instead, they had accumulated on her skin and around her neck and mouth like crusts or earthy deposits. But her grave eyes glinted from participation in the family's silent sorrow.<br><br>Na'ima stood out in this group like a rose growing in a cemetery, for she had developed into a beautiful young woman of sixteen. Her head enveloped by a halo of golden hair and her face adorned by blue eyes, she was as lovely as her mother, Aisha, had been &#x2014; or even more captivating &#x2014; but as insubstantial as a shadow. Her eyes had a gentle, dreamy look suggesting purity, innocence and otherworldliness. She nestled against her mother's side, as though unwilling to be alone even for a moment.<br><br>Rubbing her hands together over the brazier, Umm Hanafi said, "The builders will finish the project this week after working for a year and a half. . . ." <br><br>Na'ima responded sarcastically, "A building for Uncle Bayumi the drinks vendor. . . ."<br><br>Aisha raised her eyes from the brazier to look at Umm Hanafi for a moment but made no comment. They had previously learned that the house once belonging to Mr. Muhammad Ridwan would be torn down to allow construction of a four-story building for Uncle Bayumi the drinks vendor. This project had stirred up many old memories about Maryam and her divorce from Yasin &#x2014; what had become of Maryam? &#x2014; and about Maryam's gained possession of the house half by inheritance and half by purchase. Back then life had been worth living, and hearts had been carefree. <br><br>Umm Hanafi continued: "The most beautiful part of it, my lady, is Uncle Bayumi's new place for soft drinks, ice cream, and sweets. It has lots of mirrors and electric lights, with a radio playing day and night. I feel sorry for Hasanayn the barber, Darwish the beam seller, al-Fuli the milkman, and Abu Sari' with his snack shop. They have to look out of their dilapidated premises at the store and apartments of their former comrade."<br><br>Pull her shawl tighter around her shoulder, Amina said, "Glory to God who gives blessings. . . ." <br><br>With her arms around her mother's neck, Na'ima commented, "The building blocks off our roof on that side. Once it's inhabited, how can we spend any time up there?" <br><br>Amina could not ignore the question raised by her beautiful granddaughter, if only out of concern for Aisha. She answered, "Pay no attention to the tenants. Do as you like."<br><br>She glanced at Aisha to see what impression her gracious reply had made. She was so afraid for her daughter that she was almost frightened of her. But Aisha was busy looking at herself in the mirror above the dresser between her room and her father's. She had not abandoned the custom of examining her reflection, even though it had become a meaningless exercise. With the passing days her face's withered appearance had ceased to alarm her. Whenever a voice inside asked, "Where is the old Aisha?" she would answer indifferently, "And where are her sons, Muhammad and Uthman, and her husband, Khalil?"<br><br>Observing this, Amina was saddened, and her gloom quickly affected Umm Hanafi, who was so much a part of the family that their worries were hers.<br><br>Na'ima rose and went to the radio, which stood between the doors to the parlor and the dining room. Turning it on, she said, It's time for the records, Mama."<br><br>Aisha lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. Amina stared at the smoke, which spread out in a thin cloud over the brazier. A voice on the radio sang, "Companions from the good old days, how I wish you would return."<br><br>Na'ima resumed her seat, tucking the robe around her. Like her mother, she loved singing. She listened carefully so she could memorize the song and sing it in her pleasing voice. This interest was not dampened by the religious feelings that dominated her entire emotional life. She prayed conscientiously and had fasted during the month of Ramadan since the age of ten. She frequently dreamed of the mysteries of the spiritual realm and welcomed with limitless delight her grandmother's invitation to visit the mosque of al-Husayn. All the same she had never weaned herself from a love of singing. She sang whenever she was alone, in her room or in the bath.<br><br>Aisha approved of everything her one remaining child did, for Na'ima was the only bright hope on otherwise gloomy horizons. As pleased by her daughter's piety as by her voice, Aisha even loved and encouraged the girl's excessive attachment to her, not tolerating any comment on it. In fact, she had no patience for any kind of criticism, no matter how trivial or well-intentioned. Her only occupations at home were sitting, drinking coffee, and smoking. Whenever her mother invited her to help with the housework, not from a need for assistance but to distract Aisha from her thoughts, she was annoyed and uttered her famous phrase: "Oh, leave me alone." She would not let Na'ima lift a finger to help with the work either, since she feared the least exertion from her daughter. If she could have performed the prayer ritual for Na'ima, she would have, to spare her the effort. <br><br>Amina frequently chided Aisha about this, telling her that Na'ima was almost old enough to marry and needed to learn the duties of a housewife. Aisha always responded angrily, "Don't you see she's like a specter? My daughter can't bear any exertion. Leave her alone. She's my sole hope in the world."<br><br>Then, heartbroken, Amina would abandon the conversation. Gazing sadly at Aisha, she saw the personification of shattered hopes. When she looked at this unhappy face, which seemed to have lost all its vitality, Amina's soul was overcome by sorrow. Apprehensive about distressing her daughter, she had learned to greet Aisha's rude answers and harsh comments with affectionate forbearance.<br><br>The voice kept on singing, "Companions from the good old days," while Aisha smoked and listened to the song. She had been fond of singing once, and sorrow and despair had not killed her taste for it. Perhaps they had even enhanced it, since so many of the lyrics were plaintive and melancholy. Of course nothing could ever bring back her companions of the good old days. She wondered at times if that past had been a reality or a dream, a figment of her imagination. Where was that happy home? Where was her fine husband? Where were Uthman and Muhammad? Did only eight years separate her from the past?<br><br>Amina rarely liked these songs. The prime attraction of the radio for her was that it allowed her to hear recitations from the holy Qur'an and the news. The sad themes of the songs worried her. She was concerned about their effect on her daughter and remarked to Umm Hanafi one day, "Don't they sound like funeral laments to you?"<br><br>She could not stop thinking about Aisha and almost forgot the trouble she was having with high blood pressure. Visits to al-Husayn and to the other saints in their shrines were the only relief she found. Thanks to al-Sayyid Ahmad, who no longer restricted her movements, she was allowed to hurry off to God's sanctuaries whenever she felt the need. Amina herself was no longer the same woman she had once been. Grief and ill health had changed her considerably. With the passing years she had lost her amazing diligence and her extraordinary capacity for tidying up, cleaning, and running her home. Except for service to al-Sayyid Ahmad and Kamal, she paid little attention to the house. Satisfied to supervise, she had turned over the oven room and the pantry to Umm Hanafi and was remiss even in this supervision. Her confidence in their servant was boundless, for Umm Hanafi was part of the household. A lifelong companion, she had shared Amina's good and bad times and had been absorbed into the family, so that she identified with all their joys and sorrows.<br><br>They were silent for a time, as though the song had distracted them. Then Na'ima said, "I saw my friend Salma in the street today. She was in grade school with me. Next year she's going to sit for the baccalaureate examination."<br><br>Aisha commented with annoyance, "If only your grandfather had let you stay in school, you would have surpassed her. But he refused!"<br><br>The protest implied by Aisha's final phrase did not escape her mother, who said, "Her grandfather has ideas, which he won't abandon. Would you have wanted her to pursue her studies, despite the effort involved, when she's a delicate darling who can't stand fatigue?"<br><br>Aisha shook her head without speaking, but Na'ima said with regret, "I wish I had finished my education. All the girls study today, just like boys."<br><br>Umm Hanafi observed scornfully, "They study because they can't find a bridegroom. But a beauty lik...</p><h2>Memory of Fire: V 3: Century of the Wind (Memory of Fire Trilogy)</h2><p>The third volume of Galeano&#39;s highly praised history of the Americas offers us our own turbulent century, from its first apocalyptic intimations to the age of Reagan.</p><p>lume of Galeano&#39;s highly praised history of the Americas offers us our own turbulent century, from its first apocalyptic intimations to the age of Reagan.Eduardo Galeano (1940&#x2015;2015) was the author of Open Veins of Latin America, Days and Nights of Love and War, The Book of Embraces, We Say No, and other works.</p><h2>Early New England Gravestone Rubbings</h2><p>PICTORIAL DOCUMENTATION , NOTES ON PLATES,</p><p></p><h2>Tomato Blessings and Radish Teachings</h2><p>A Zen priest and author of The Tassajara Bread Book interweaves recipes and meditations, presenting a range of delicious treats, including Irish oat cakes and ginger muffins, while reflecting on the spiritual aspects of food and life.</p><p>It is no surprise that <i>Tomato Blessings and Radish Teachings</i> offers a transcendental experience; the author is a Zen monk. He also ranks just behind culinary luminaries Alice Waters of Chez Panisse restaurant in California, and Deborah Madison, an expert on natural ingredients. Brown's 125 vegetarian recipes range from an elementally simple saut� of apple slices plumped in butter, cinnamon and sugar, to the exciting combination of Chili Crepes with Goat Cheese Filling Served over Garlicky Black Beans. Garbanzo Bean Stew with Spinach and Saffron, and a lasagne made with cabbage leaves and potatoes simmered gently with lots of garlic, red wine, and a dash of cream are other ways Brown shares his refreshing creativity, which is always tempered by his innate sense of what works.<p> Direct but playful, Brown devotes half of <i>Tomato Blessing and Radish Teachings</i> to stories about his spiritual path, which led him through the kitchens of the Tassajara and San Francisco Zen Centers. Most of his learning centered around working with food. So do these stories, intended to help the reader move towards inner peace and contentment. "Playing with Fire," for instance, is a fable about starting a fire with wet wood. It is a comment on how life proceeds at the pace it requires, which then ties into thoughts about grilling! Recipes for Grilled Eggplant Salad and the exquisite revelation of Grilled Figs accompany this wisdom. As Brown says, you can read this book for its stories, just for its recipes, or for both.

Thus spake Bruce Aidells and Denis Kelly, their first words in <i>The Complete Meat Cookbook</i>. "This book," these well-informed authors tell us, "is written for those who share this carnivorous inclination." As the authors of <i>Hot Links and Country Flavors</i>, <i>Real Beer and Good Eats</i>, and <i>Flying Sausages</i>, these guys know meat. And their mission in life is to share what they know. With gusto. <p> The divisions are obvious: beef, pork, lamb, veal. But packed into each chapter is more information than any single reader might think possible. There's history and anthropology; there's anatomy and kitchen chemistry. And all of it is aimed at what the authors call the "new meat." It's a leaner product--less fat than ever before. So to get the succulence and the flavor that resides in memory (coming from a time of fattier cuts) sliced and onto the plate, today's cook has to use a different, more informed approach. You will find that guidance in this book. How to select and buy, how to prep, how to intensify the flavor, how to cook, how to store: it's all here. There is no other book like it. </p><p> Heavily illustrated, <i>The Complete Meat Cookbook</i> opens with a section on meat basics, including a little meat eating history and a terrific doneness chart. Then there's a long section covering all the basic cooking techniques and which cuts of which meat work best with each technique. Once the book breaks out into sections by kind of meat--beef, pork, lamb, veal--the depth of information focuses and intensifies, and the recipes roll right along for more than 600 pages.</p><p> Myth busting (like, don't salt meat before cooking, it will dry it out: wrong) is highlighted throughout the book. And each recipe is labeled for ease, speed, budget consciousness, serve to company, etc. The recipes take into account the world of meat eating. This is no Eurocentric text--it is, as the title proclaims, complete. If you are going to eat meat, do it right. This is the book to show you how. No cookbook bookshelf is complete without a copy of <i>The Complete Meat Cookbook</i>. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Bruce Aidells is the owner and founder of Aidells Sausage Company, whose products are distributed nationally.

Lavishly illustrated, these three tales show Cadfael at the height of his sleuthing form. &#34;Three classic stories featuring Brother Cadfael . . . whose powers of deduction are practically miraculous&#34;.--Booklist.</p><p>Ellis Peters was a pseudonym of Edith Pargeter, OBE. As Ellis Peters she was the bestselling author of twenty Brother Cadfael Chronicles and the illustrated short story collection A Rare Benedictine. Under her own name she wrote numerous critically acclaimed historical novels including A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury and The Brothers of Gwynedd Quartet. She was the recipient of the Crime Writer&#39;s Association and Cartier Diamond Dagger Award. She died in 1995.What better introduction to Ellis Peters's classic mysteries than this trio of stories introducing her well-loved medieval sleuth, Brother Cadfael? Beginning with Cadfael's transformation from crusading warrior to Benedictine monk and moving through devious doings at Shrewsbury Abbey, Stephen Thorne's narrative enhances the liveliness and detail of Peters's evocative characters and settings. As Cadfael blends herbal poultices in his apothecary, so Thorne's delivery blends clearly defined delivery with just the right proportions of vocal drama to yield a reading of rare enjoyment. While actor Derek Jacobi's version of Brother Cadfael on PBS's "Mystery" series presents a ready picture for the eye, the pure ear appeal of Cadfael's rolling Welsh burr in this recording provides a pleasure far more lingering.

How can such sublime work have been produced by a man who seems so ordinary, so opaque - and occasionally so intemperate? In this remarkable book, John Eliot Gardiner distils the fruits of a lifetime&#39;s immersion as one of Bach&#39;s greatest living interpreters. Explaining in wonderful detail how Bach worked and how his music achieves its effects, he also takes us as deeply into Bach&#39;s works and mind as perhaps words can. The result is a unique book about one of the greatest of all creative artists.</p><p>Sir John Eliot Gardiner is one of the world&#39;s leading conductors, not only of Baroque music but across the whole repertoire. He founded the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestra, the Orchestre de l&#39;Op�ra de Lyon, the English Baroque Soloists, and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique. He conducts most of the world&#39;s great orchestras and in many of the leading opera houses. He lives and farms in Dorset.1<br><br>Under the Cantor&#x2019;s Gaze<br><br>In the autumn of 1936 a thirty-year-old music teacher from Bad Warmbrunn in Lower Silesia suddenly appeared in a Dorset village with two items in his luggage: a guitar and a portrait in oils of Bach. Like old Veit Bach, the founder of the clan, escaping from Eastern Europe as a religious refugee almost four centuries earlier, Walter Jenke had left Germany just as Jews were being banned from holding professional posts. He settled and found work in North Dorset, married an English girl and, with war imminent, looked for a safe home for his painting. His great-grandfather had purchased a portrait of Bach in a curiosity shop sometime in the 1820s for next to nothing. Doubtless he did not know at the time that this was &#x2013; and still is &#x2013; by far the most important Bach portrait in existence. Had Jenke left it with his mother in Bad Warmbrunn, it would almost certainly not have survived the bombardment or the evacuation of Germans from Silesia in the face of the advancing Red Army.<br><br>I grew up under the Cantor&#x2019;s gaze. The celebrated Haussmann portrait of Bach1 had been given to my parents for safekeeping for the duration of the war, and it took pride of place on the first-floor landing of the old mill in Dorset where I was born. Every night on my way to bed I tried to avoid its forbidding stare. I was doubly fortunate as a child in that I grew up on a farm and into a music-minded family where it was considered perfectly normal to sing &#x2013; on a tractor or horseback (my father), at table (the whole family sang grace at mealtimes) or at weekend gatherings, outlets for my parents&#x2019; love of vocal music. All through the war years they and a few local friends convened every Sunday morning to sing William Byrd&#x2019;s Mass for Four Voices. As children my brother, sister and I grew up getting to know a grand miscellany of unaccompanied choral music &#x2013; from Josquin to Palestrina, Tallis to Purcell, Monteverdi to Sch�tz, and, eventually, Bach. Compared to the earlier polyphony, Bach&#x2019;s motets, we found, were a lot more difficult technically &#x2013; those long, long phrases with nowhere to breathe &#x2013; but I remember loving the interplay of voices, with so much going on at once, and that pulsating rhythm underneath keeping everything afloat. By the time I was twelve I knew the treble parts of most of Bach&#x2019;s six motets more or less by heart. They became part of the primary matter in my head (along with folksongs, ribald poems in Dorset dialect and heaven knows what else, stored in my memory) and have never left me.<br><br>Then, during my teens, I came to know some of his instrumental music: the Brandenburg Concertos, the violin sonatas and concertos (with which, as a distinctly average fiddle-player, I often struggled &#x2013; and usually lost &#x2013; between the ages of nine and eighteen, at which stage I switched to the viola), some of the keyboard pieces and several cantata arias for alto, of which my mother was very fond. Even now I cannot hear arias such as &#x2018;Gelobet sei der Herr, mein Gott&#x2019; (&#x2018;The Lord be praised&#x2019;) or &#x2018;Von der Welt verlang ich nichts&#x2019; (&#x2018;I ask nothing of the world&#x2019;) without a lump in my throat, remembering her voice floating across the courtyard from the mill-room. But my early apprenticeship in Bach, the nurturing of a lifelong engagement with his music and a longing to understand the stern Cantor at the top of the stairs, I owe to four remarkable teachers &#x2013; three women and one man &#x2013; who helped to determine the kind of musician I was to become.<br><br>The man was Wilfred Brown, the great English tenor, who visited my school when I was fourteen, singing both the Evangelist and the tenor arias in a performance of Bach&#x2019;s John Passion. I was so captivated that, unpardonable in a principal second violin, at one point I stopped playing altogether and just gawped. As an interpreter of Bach&#x2019;s Evangelist, Bill Brown was nonpareil. His singing was characterised by an extraordinary subtlety of inflection and word-painting, and by a pathos that was inseparable from his own Quaker beliefs and the humility they brought, something I recognised from my mother&#x2019;s Quaker upbringing. Later on he offered to give me singing lessons from the time I was sixteen until I was twenty-two, sometimes travelling to Cambridge to do so and always refusing a fee.<br><br>Imogen Holst, daughter of Gustav and amanuensis to Benjamin Britten, was a regular visitor to my parents&#x2019; home and sometimes led their choral weekends and gave singing lessons to me and my sister. She, I suppose more than any other musician I had encountered at that early stage, stressed the importance of dance in Baroque music. This was so clearly visible in her own interpretation and her way of conducting Bach that someone once filmed her just from the waist downwards while conducting the B minor Mass. To this day, thanks to Imo, I feel that the worst interpretative sin (committed with painful regularity even now) is to plod in Bach; denying or resisting the rhythmical elasticity and buoyancy of his music ensures that its spirit shoots out of the door. In speaking touchingly of her father, she stressed the indispensability of music, that it was a part of life that &#x2018;can&#x2019;t be done without&#x2019;.<br><br>Letting Bach dance was one lesson well learnt; the other was how to make him &#x2018;sing&#x2019;. This sounds so obvious and so much easier than it is in practice. Not all of Bach&#x2019;s melodies are singer-friendly or melodious in the way that, say, Purcell&#x2019;s or Schubert&#x2019;s are. Often angular, the phrase-lengths uncomfortably long, peppered with little curlicue flourishes and ornaments, they require a lot of purpose, underpinned by iron breath-control, before they can truly sing. And that applies not just to the vocal lines, but to the instrumental ones as well. This I learnt from my violin teacher, Sybil Eaton, a pupil of the celebrated Greek violinist and musicologist Minos Dounias. Sybil certainly &#x2018;sang&#x2019; when she played the fiddle, but, through her inspirational teaching and sheer love of Bach, she was also able to help her pupils to take melodic wing, whether we were playing concertos, solo partitas or obbligato parts to arias from the Passions or the cantatas.<br><br>The person who crystallised all these ideas for me was Nadia Boulanger, justly recognised as the most celebrated teacher of composition in the twentieth century. When she accepted me as a student in Paris in 1967, she had just turned eighty and was partially blind, but with all her other faculties in tip-top order. Her way of teaching harmony was founded on Bach&#x2019;s chorales, which she regarded as models of how to establish a beautiful polyphony &#x2013; with each voice being accorded equal importance while still playing a different role in the four-way conversation, now advancing, now retreating: contrapuntally conceived harmony, in other words. She insisted that the freedom to express yourself in music, whether as a composer, conductor or performer, demanded obedience to certain laws and the possession of unassailable technical skills. One of her favourite sayings was &#x2018;Talent [by which I think she meant technique] without genius is not worth much; but genius without talent is worth nothing whatsoever.&#x2019;<br><br>Confined for two years to an unvarying diet of harmony and counterpoint exercises and solf�ge (the particularly nasty but effective French system of ear-training), I metaphorically kicked and scratched like a cornered animal. On at least one occasion, from sheer frustration, Hindemith&#x2019;s Elementary Training for Musicians ended up in the gutter &#x2013; thrown out of the window of my bed-sit in the 4th arrondissement. But I owe her a colossal debt. She had a way of challenging every preconception as well as a knack of exposing one&#x2019;s shortcomings, technical or otherwise, quite mercilessly. She saw something in me that I did not even see in myself. It was only after I had left the boulangerie that I realised that what had seemed like torture at the time was actually an act of kindness, equipping me to avoid certain professional embarrassments in the future. And, despite her severity, she was extraordinarily generous, even bequeathing to me her unique collection of transcriptions of Renaissance and Baroque music (from Monteverdi to Rameau), including scores and parts of her favourite Bach cantatas, all meticulously annotated &#x2013; some of my most treasured possessions.<br><br>How was I to translate this painfully acquired theory and ear-training into actual sound when standing in front of a choir and orchestra? Luckily by this stage (1967&#x2013;8), while I was a student in Paris and Fontainebleau, from time to time I had access to an &#x2018;instrument&#x2019; in London &#x2013; the Monteverdi Choir. It had all started back in 1964 when I was in my third year at Cambridge. My tutor, the social anthropologist Edmund Leach, authorised me to take a year off from the History tripos to sieve through the possible directions my life might take and, crucially, to find out whether I really had it in me to become a full-time musician. Ostensibly I was there to read Classical Arabic and medieval Spanish; in practice the task I set myself was to perform Monteverdi&#x2019;s 1610 Vespers, a work that, although I had first heard it as a child, was still very little known and had never before been performed in Cambridge. Despite the dual handicap of my relative inexperience as a conductor and my little formal musical training up to that point, I had set my heart on conducting one of the most challenging works in the choral repertoire. I spent the best part of that year studying the original part-books on microfilm and, with the encouragement of the Professor of Music, Thurston Dart, preparing a new performing edition. I also ended up doing everything involved in planning a public performance in King&#x2019;s College Chapel &#x2013; from assembling and training the choir and orchestra, to having the tickets printed and putting out the chairs.<br><br>Vibrant colour contrasts and passionate declamation seemed to me to be the hallmark of this music. The test for me was whether I could draw any of that from a group of student singers trained in a totally different tradition. To that extent the Monteverdi Choir started life as an anti-choir &#x2013; in reaction to the well-mannered euphony and blend which characterised the celebrated chapel choir at King&#x2019;s in my day, whose mantra was &#x2018;Never louder than lovely&#x2019;. Their style was summed up for me by a performance, at Boris Ord&#x2019;s memorial service, of Jesu, meine Freude &#x2013; that most extended and interpretatively challenging of Bach&#x2019;s motets &#x2013; sung in English with effete and lip-wiping prissiness: &#x2018;Jesu . . .&#x2019; (pronounced Jeez-ewe), followed by a huge comma and expressive intake of breath, &#x2018;. . . priceless treasure&#x2019; (pronounced trez-ewer). I seethed. How had the wonderfully exultant music that I had known since I was a child come to be treated in such a precious, etiolated way? Was this not like adding a layer of face powder and a few beauty spots to the dour old Cantor&#x2019;s portrait?<br><br>My first attempt at performing Monteverdi&#x2019;s masterpiece took place in March 1964 with some of the same performers. It fell a long way short of the ideals I had set for it, yet people who heard it were encouraging, even enthusiastic. For me it was not just a test of skill, but the epiphany I had been searching for. The decision was made: better to follow an overwhelming passion, even one that would need years of study and practice and with absolutely no guarantee of success, than to pursue safer career paths for which I might already have had the rudimentary technical qualifications. I was encouraged to persist in my rebellion against the vestiges of Victorian performance and to find a more permanent footing for the Monteverdi Choir. My starting-point, then as now, was to bring passion and expressivity to the vocal music of the Baroque, and, as appropriate, to the nationality, period and personality of the composer. In a typical programme, such as we gave in the Cambridge Festival in 1965, devoted to music by Monteverdi, Sch�tz and Purcell, we set out to enable listeners to hear the idiosyncratic approach of each master sung in the original language, to follow each composer as he experimented with music based on recitation over a figured bass line and revelled in the new expressive range it offered. It was heady stuff, and our efforts were doubtless crude and exaggerated; but at least they did not sound half-baked or indistinguishable from Anglican pieties during a wet November Evensong.<br><br>I was desperately short of working models. Nadia Boulanger no longer conducted. Nor did Thurston Dart, from whose Sherlock Holmes-like approach to musicology I had learnt a great deal in the postgraduate year that I studied with him after he moved to King&#x2019;s College, London. I did, however, have the luck to observe the distinguished keyboard virtuoso and conductor George Malcolm. George knew how to draw dazzling performances of a most un-English ardour from his choir at Westminster Cathedral, and, amazingly, he took the trouble to travel up to Cambridge to hear my first Vespers performance. Here was a true master and, I felt, a kindred spirit, whose approbation and encouragement at that stage made all the difference to me, although he had virtually given up choral conducting. <br><br>Then, at a friend&#x2019;s invitation, I went to hear Karl Richter conduct his Munich Bach Choir in 1967. Richter was acclaimed as the foremost exponent of Bach&#x2019;s choral music at the time, but even his muscular LP recordings of cantatas hadn&#x2019;t prepared me for the oppressive volume and sheer aggression of the motet Singet dem Herrn as delivered by seventy lusty Bavarians from the gallery of the Markuskirche. This was a world apart from the mincing &#x2018;holy, holy&#x2019; approach of King&#x2019;s or the Bach Choir in London in their annual Good Friday Matthew Passion outing at the Royal Festival Hall, but hardly more inspiriting. Nor did Richter&#x2019;s thunderous approach to the Goldberg Variations next day on a souped-up Neupert harpsichord, given in the Musikhochschule (Hitler&#x2019;s former residence), do much to restore my faith. Here, as in most of the live performances or recordings that I had access to, Bach came over as grim, sombre, po-faced, lacking in spirit, humour and humanity. Where was the festive joy and zest of this dance-impregnated music? A few years later I heard a performance of the John Passion under Benjamin Britten, a very fine conductor who combed out the separate strands of Bach&#x2019;s elaborate counterpoint before my ears, revealing the work&#x2019;s drama from the inside. Yet, even so, to me it sounded fatally &#x2018;English&#x2019;. I felt a similar disappointment when I first heard Mozart played in Salzburg and Vienna in 1958: the elegant surface of the playing seemed to overlay and disguise the turbulent emotional inner life of the music.</p><h2>Wonder&#39;s First Race (Thoroughbred Series #3)</h2><p>Is Wonder's racing career over before it begins?<p></p><p>Against all odds, Ashleigh Griffen's favorite racehorse, Wonder, has come through training with flying colors.

Eliza is confident that he will return home, and she helps pass the months making a special quilt to keep Will warm during his winter in the army. When the unthinkable happens, she takes in a woman and child who have been left alone and made vulnerable by the war, and she finds solace and camaraderie amongst the women of her quilting group. And when she is asked to help hide an escaped slave, she must decide for herself what is right, and who can she can count on to help her.</p></p><p><p>SANDRA DALLAS is the author of thirteen novels, including <i>Fallen Women, True Sisters</i>, <i>The Bride's House</i>, <i>Whiter Than Snow</i>, <i>Prayers for Sale</i>, <i>Tallgrass</i> and <i>New Mercies</i>. She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week</i> magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Christmas Eve, 1864</p> <p>The postmaster handed Eliza the letter the day before Christmas. It had sat in the box for a week, waiting for her, he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have sent it along, but nobody was going out your way. I figured you&#x2019;d be in for the oranges. I set two aside for you, the best two.&#x201d; The man operated the post office out of his general store.</p> <p>The oranges were the reason Eliza had hitched old Sabra to the wagon and driven into town. She had a sack of corn in the back to trade, a steep price for two oranges, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. There were no coins to be spent. Will had promised to send her his thirteen dollars a month pay, but so far, she&#x2019;d received nothing.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Will, is it not?&#x201d; the postmaster asked, fingering the letter as if it were his own.</p> <p>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; Eliza snatched the missive, as if she feared the man would open and read it himself. Perhaps he had already, for the letter was not sealed with wax but merely folded into itself, forming its own envelope.</p> <p>But the postmaster didn&#x2019;t comment on the contents. &#x201c;A nice Christmas present for you, then. I&#x2019;ll fetch them oranges.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza nodded. The oranges were likely not the best ones at all but the culls, dull orange in color, shriveled, the juice half gone. But they were oranges, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be Christmas without them. She had told the children there might not be oranges this year, what with the war. After all, oranges came from somewhere in the South, so maybe the storekeeper wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get them. Davy and Luzena had said they understood, but she knew they would be disappointed. They had always had oranges at Christmas. When they were younger, Davy and Luzena would consume the fruit all at once, letting the juice run down their fingers, but now that they were older, they carefully savored each section so that the orange lasted the entire Christmas day. And they saved the peels for their mother to dry, then chop up for her cooking. Once Davy had cut his orange in half and scraped out the pulp with his teeth. Then he had fastened each half of the cleaned orange to the bottom of a bottle, where it dried hard into a cup. He&#x2019;d hidden the cups a whole year, until the following Christmas, giving one to Luzena, the other to Eliza, who used it for her pins.</p> <p>This year they would have the Christmas oranges after all, along with the divinity candy that Eliza had set aside when she made the batch for Will, had secreted it in a tin for a surprise. She would stew the rooster she had killed that morning and add potatoes and onions, mix in a few herbs she had collected and dried in the summer. And then she would surprise the children with the presents&#x2014;a knife for Davy that Will had found on the road just before he left. Eliza had rubbed the rust from the knife, then polished it until it looked almost new. And there was a wooden doll for Luzena, although she was nearly too old for such a plaything. Will had carved the doll before he left for a soldier, and had given it to Eliza to hide. She&#x2019;d made an indigo dress for the doll and wrapped it in a tiny quilt made from scraps left over from the Stars and Stripes quilt. Now, best of all, there would be Will&#x2019;s letter to read. She wouldn&#x2019;t open the letter until Christmas morning. They would read it before church.</p> <p>As she left the store, the letter and the oranges safe in her basket, Eliza scanned the sky, thinking the three of them might not make it to church at all. The snow had threatened even before she set out for town, and she had worried that it might come quickly and make the driving difficult. But a snowstorm would not have kept her from the Christmas oranges.</p> <p>The snow was coming fast, in flakes as big and as soft as the down in Will&#x2019;s Christmas quilt. As she hurried to the wagon, Eliza wondered if he had received it. She smiled to think that Will would spend the night before Christmas wrapped in the down-filled quilt she had made for him. She wondered if he would rub his hand against his name and hers and know how much she had loved stitching them, how much she loved him. She climbed into the wagon and flicked the reins against Sabra&#x2019;s back, and the horse started up, taking a quick step or two before settling into a walk. The horse was old, and Eliza was grateful the mare could pull the wagon at all.</p> <p>As she slapped the reins against Sabra&#x2019;s back a second time, she heard someone shout, &#x201c;Eliza!&#x201d; and reined in the horse. She turned to the voice, unsure in the snow who was speaking to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Missouri Ann Stark,&#x201d; a young woman said, emerging from the store and coming up to the wagon. &#x201c;I saw you in the post office. I guess you didn&#x2019;t see me.&#x201d; Missouri Ann was small and pretty, with green eyes and hair so pale it was almost the white of the snow. But her face was gray and gaunt.</p> <p>&#x201c;I ask you to forgive me. There was a letter from Will, and for just about a minute, I forgot where I was.&#x201d; Eliza saw that her friend was clutching her own envelope. &#x201c;Did you hear from Hugh, too? That would make Christmas all the better if we both got letters.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann shook her head. &#x201c;Hugh can&#x2019;t write. Couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza stared at the woman. &#x201c;What do you mean, <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, Eliza, Hugh&#x2019;s dead. I&#x2019;m a widow woman.&#x201d; She stopped, as if studying the words, and repeated them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a widow woman. I don&#x2019;t have a husband no more.&#x201d; She rubbed her shawl across her face, then steadied herself. &#x201c;It says right here in this letter that Hugh&#x2019;s killed hisself in the battle. They&#x2019;s wrote he died. Here, I&#x2019;ll read it to you. &#x2018;Missus Stark, your husband was perfectly resigned to dying. His final words were, &#x201c;I die for a worthy cause.&#x201d; He died a-praising the Union and said for you not to worry because he was going to a better place.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you believe it?&#x201d; Eliza blurted out. She shouldn&#x2019;t have asked such a thing, but those were not words Hugh Stark would have spoken. More likely in his final moments, he would have profaned the Lord as well as the Union Army for playing such a rotten trick on him as to let him pass over.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, but it&#x2019;s nice they wrote it.&#x201d; She looked up, her face damp, but whether the wetness came from tears or snow Eliza didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;Oh, Eliza, what&#x2019;s to become of us?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Missouri Ann. It isn&#x2019;t fair the war&#x2019;s taken our men. I suppose you and Nance will stay on with the Starks.&#x201d; Eliza didn&#x2019;t like the Starks. They were loud and foulmouthed and lived like hogs. Hugh&#x2019;s brothers were too unpatriotic or too cowardly to join the army. After they married, Hugh and Missouri Ann had gone to housekeeping on their own place, but when Hugh joined up, he moved his wife and daughter in with his family. Eliza had called on her friend only once at the Stark farm, because she could sense Missouri Ann&#x2019;s embarrassment at the way her husband&#x2019;s family lived. They were lazy and stupid, without sense enough to put butter on bread. Eliza couldn&#x2019;t think how they kept themselves, because nothing ever hatched on their farm.</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m between a hawk and a buzzard. They won&#x2019;t let me go, but I can&#x2019;t stay. They treat me like chicken scratch, and with Hugh dead, his brothers likely&nbsp;&#x2026; Only thing protected me was they knew Hugh&#x2019;d womp them if they didn&#x2019;t treat me right.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re family. And surely they dote on Nance.&#x201d; Missouri Ann&#x2019;s daughter was not quite two. She was a pretty thing, with fine golden hair and hazel eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice. Only Mother Stark does. The men blame me she&#x2019;s not a boy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll go back to your own people, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. When I married Hugh, my folks said I couldn&#x2019;t never come home again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But they didn&#x2019;t mean it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They did, all right. They wouldn&#x2019;t take me in if it was snowing ice cakes and I was dressed naked.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza understood. Missouri Ann&#x2019;s family was as judgmental as the Starks were mean.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, Eliza, I thought about it, &#x2019;course, thought what I&#x2019;d do if Hugh got killed in the war, but never did I come up with a plan.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza got out of the wagon and put her arms around Missouri Ann. &#x201c;Do you have to tell the Starks that Hugh&#x2019;s dead? You could wait until you&#x2019;ve found a place for you and Nance.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d thought of that. But I told the postmaster what was in the letter, and you know how you can&#x2019;t never trust him to keep a secret. Besides, Dad Stark gets the paper from Topeka every week where it lists the dead. He has me read it to him, for he can&#x2019;t read, neither. And how am I going to just skip over Hugh&#x2019;s name if it&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann tucked the letter into the bosom of her dress and wiped her face with her hands. &#x201c;I guess I should be mourning Hugh instead of worrying about me and Nance, but I can&#x2019;t help it. I got to think of us first. Mourning&#x2019;s for rich folks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Have you prayed?&#x201d; Eliza said, and immediately regretted the words. When would Missouri Ann have prayed? She&#x2019;d just received the letter. Besides, Missouri Ann hadn&#x2019;t been in church for a long time. She wasn&#x2019;t a praying woman.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me and the Lord ain&#x2019;t too acquainted of late.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe not, but surely someone at the church would find a place for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe you forgot Nance came awful early, and there&#x2019;s some that holds it against me, believes me to be a prodigal woman.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza did remember now, but the gossiping had been more about Missouri Ann fornicating with a Stark than about the early arrival of the baby. The baby had been the only explanation Eliza could think of for why Missouri Ann, that sweet girl, had married Hugh. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to have a briar-patch child, a bastard.</p> <p>Missouri Ann looked Eliza square in the face and said, &#x201c;I could come live with you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</p> <p>The new widow had been holding her breath, and now she said in a rush, &#x201c;You got that hired man&#x2019;s soddy out back of your house. I could work around the place to pay for lodging. And Nance won&#x2019;t be no trouble. We wouldn&#x2019;t be a burden to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a ramshackle house with a hole in the wall where the snow drifts in. That&#x2019;s no fit place for a woman and child.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a good fixer. You should have seen me at the Stark place, nailing up boards. I wanted it warm for Nance. I asked the boys, but they&#x2019;re lazy as summer rain. They don&#x2019;t do nothing and don&#x2019;t start that till after dinner. The roof on that cabin is awful bad, and Mother Stark complained the rain was coming in on her bed and asked them to do something about it. So they went upstairs and moved the bed. That&#x2019;s all the good they are, and her their mother, birthing and raising them. She was the only decent one in the lot.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza laughed despite herself. She wondered again why Missouri Ann had married into such a family, why she&#x2019;d fallen in love with Hugh Stark. Maybe it had been his good looks and the slow way he smiled. He&#x2019;d seemed truly taken with Missouri Ann, however, and might have been a better man than she&#x2019;d given him credit for, although she wasn&#x2019;t sure. And then she remembered that Hugh Stark&#x2019;s widow was standing in front of her. &#x201c;He was a good husband. I&#x2019;m sorry about Hugh, Missouri Ann. Truly I am.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann looked away. &#x201c;Like I say, I can&#x2019;t think about that now. I got to ponder what I&#x2019;m going to do. I best have plans before the Starks find out about Hugh. They might expect me to marry Edison.&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman had said that last in such a low voice that Eliza had strained to hear her, and even then, she wasn&#x2019;t sure she had heard right. &#x201c;Marry Edison? Edison Stark? Hugh&#x2019;s brother?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The same.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One-legged Edison?&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;But why would you do that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It might be I won&#x2019;t have a choice. You don&#x2019;t know the Starks, Eliza. Mother Stark said if anything happened to Hugh, I&#x2019;d best get away fast, or it might be I&#x2019;d never get another chance. She said it was too late for her, too late by thirty years, but I still had time. The Starks don&#x2019;t want me, but they won&#x2019;t let me go, neither.&#x201d;</p> <p>Had Hugh been like the rest of them? Eliza wondered. Had the sins of his father passed on to him? But Missouri Ann cared for him, so maybe he was different.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hugh was the best of them,&#x201d; Missouri Ann said, as if she knew what Eliza was thinking. &#x201c;He was a good man. I&#x2019;ll raise Nance to think well of her father.&#x201d; Then she added, &#x201c;Maybe I could stay with old Aunt Grace. She needs someone to have a care for her.&#x201d;</p> <p>Old Aunt Grace was a slattern who lived in a shack in the woods and trapped wild animals, eating their flesh and selling their skins.</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Eliza said, horrified. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll move in with us.&#x201d; She said it quickly, without much thought, but now she realized she had no choice but to take in Missouri Ann and Nance. What if Will had been killed and she and the children had had to leave the farm? Where would they have gone? &#x201c;We would welcome you and Nance, Missouri Ann.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann stared at Eliza. &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza said they would go and get Missouri Ann&#x2019;s things right then, before the storm got worse.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll have to sneak away. I&#x2019;ll walk to your place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;In this snow?&#x201d; Eliza thought a moment, then said they could meet at church the following day.</p> <p>Missouri Ann frowned. &#x201c;Starks don&#x2019;t go to church, even at Christmas.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then you must tell them you are going to church for Nance&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Eliza said. &#x201c;What about your belongings?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t got any,&#x201d; Missouri Ann said.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>As she rode behind the slow horse back to the farm, Eliza wondered what had happened to her friend in the past few years. She&#x2019;d been shocked, of course, when Missouri Ann married Hugh Stark. He was a comely man with a smile that would have melted ice in midwinter, but there had been something about him that Eliza feared. Missouri Ann had been raised by a family of holy willies whose only joy was pointing out the sins of others. Eliza&#x2019;s friend knew from an early age she was going to hell, so what did it matter if she broke a few of God&#x2019;s laws, especially the one about fornication? But with a Stark! Missouri Ann was guileless and good. She could have done better. And then to be dumped at the Stark shanty when Hugh went off to war! Missouri Ann was a tough girl, but she had grown depressed, beaten down in the last months. Well, who wouldn&#x2019;t be, living with a family like that? Eliza chided herself for not having been a better friend. Then she wondered if Missouri Ann had any friends at all or whether, like Eliza, they&#x2019;d been discouraged from visiting.</p> <p>Of course Eliza would let Missouri Ann and Nance live at the Spooner farm. She wondered that she had hesitated at all. Things would be tight. They would all have to be careful to make the food last through the winter. The harvest had been all right, although even with the help of men working on shares, they had had to leave some of the crops to rot. Eliza had tried to persuade Will to wait to join up until after the harvest was over, but he was anxious to kill the Rebels. He&#x2019;d said she could manage, and she had, although not as well as if he&#x2019;d been there.</p> <p>Even if Hugh&#x2019;s pay came through, there would be little money for necessities and none for extravagances such as more oranges. It was doubtful Missouri Ann would bring so much as a penny with her. But they would make it. Having another woman living on the place might help the loneliness she had felt since Will enlisted. And Eliza and the children would be safer with another adult there. She&#x2019;d worried about safety ever since Davy found that tramp in the barn.</p> <p>The cold had begun to seep into Eliza&#x2019;s bones, and she tried to hurry the horse, but Sabra couldn&#x2019;t be persuaded to pick up speed. Eliza hoped the Stark horse was faster, because she didn&#x2019;t like to think about baby Nance out in the cold. She had glimpsed the child peering out of the window ...</p></p><h2>Soul Providers</h2><p><p>Needing to repay God for a teenage accident, a young soldier embraces a group of missionaries in the town where his base is located.

We raise our eyes and see the glass; we note its quality, and observe its defects; we speculate on its composition. Or we look straight through it on the great prospect of land and sea and sky beyond. Benjamin B. Warfield "Some Thoughts on Predestination" God stretched out the heavens, stippling the night with impressionistic stars. He set the sun to the rhythm of the day, the moon to the rhythm of the month, the seasons to the rhythm of the year. He blew wind through reedy marshes and beat drums of distant thunder. He formed a likeness of Himself from a lump of clay and into it breathed life. He crafted a counterpart to complete the likeness, joining the two halves and placing them center stage in His creation where there was a temptation and a fall, a great loss and a great hiding. God searched for the hiding couple, reaching to pick them up, dust them off, draw them near. Though they hardly knew it at the time. After them, He searched for their children and for their children&#x2019;s children. And afterward wrote stories of His search. In doing all this, God gave us art, music, sculpture, drama, and literature. He gave them as footpaths to lead us out of our hiding places and as signposts to lead us along in our search for what was lost. Shaped from something of earth and something of heaven, we were torn between two worlds. A part of us wanted to hide. A part of us wanted to search. With half-remembered words still legible in our hearts and faintly sketched images still visible in our souls, some of us stepped out of hiding and started our search. Though we hardly knew where to look. We painted to see if what was lost was in the picture. We composed to hear if what was lost was in the music. We sculpted to find if what was lost was in the stone. We wrote to discover if what was lost was in the story. Through art and music and stories we searched for what was missing from our lives. Though at times we hardly knew it. Though at times we could hardly keep from knowing it. The German poet Rilke tells of one of those times in a fable where the sculpting hands of Michelangelo "tore at the stone as at a grave, in which a faint dying voice is flickering. &#x2018;Michelangelo,&#x2019; cried God in dread, &#x2018;who is in the stone?&#x2019; Michelangelo listened; his hands were trembling. Then he answered in a muffled voice: &#x2018;Thou, my God, who else? But I cannot reach Thee.&#x2019; " We reach for God in many ways. Through our sculptures and our scriptures. Through our pictures and our prayers. Through our writing and our worship. And through them He reaches for us. His search begins with something said. Ours begins with something heard. His begins with something shown. Ours, with something seen. Our search for God and His search for us meet at windows in our everyday experience. These are the windows of the soul. In a sense, it is something like spiritual disciplines for the spiritually undisciplined. In another sense, it is the most rigorous of disciplines &#x2014; the discipline of awareness. For we must always be looking and listening if we are to see the windows and hear what is being spoken to us through them. But we must learn to look with more than just our eyes and listen with more than just our ears, for the sounds are sometimes faint and the sights sometimes far away. We must be aware, at all times and in all places, because windows are everywhere, and at any time we may find one. Or one may find us. Though we will hardly know it . . . unless we are searching for Him who for so long has been searching for us. When we look long enough at a scene from a movie, a page from a book, a person from across the room, and when we look deeply enough, those moments framed in our minds grow transparent. Everywhere we look, there are pictures that are not really pictures but windows. If only we have eyes to see beyond the paint. If we look closely, we can see something beyond the two dimensions within the frame, something beyond the ordinary colors brushed across the canvas of our everyday lives. What do we see in those windows? What do we see of who we are, or once were, or one day might become? What do we see of our neighbor living down the street or our neighbor living on the street? What do we see about God? Windows of the soul is a way of seeing that begins with respect. The way we show respect is to give it a second look, a look not of the eyes but of the heart. But so often we don&#x2019;t give something a second look because we don&#x2019;t think there is anything there to see. To respect something is to understand that there is something there to see, that it is not all surface, that something lies beneath the surface, something that has the power to change the way we think or feel, something that may prove so profound a revelation as to change not only how we look at our lives but how we live them.</p><h2>Twelve Months of Monastery Salads: 200 Divine Recipes for All Seasons</h2><p>Salads are healthy, convenient, versatile, and more popular than ever due to the year-round availability of high quality salad ingredients. According to a recent survey, 95% of Americans eat salad at least three times per week. InTwelve Months of Monastery Salads, best-selling author Brother Victor celebrates creative, nourishing salads - a cuisine in harmony with traditional monastic cooking. Monastic cooking centers on simple, fresh, wholesome ingredients, and monks rely a great deal on the seasonal harvest of their gardens. This engaging collection of more than 200 delicious, satisfying salads is organized according to the bounty of the seasons from the first spring harvest (Salmon and Cucumber Salad) to the heartier fare of the winter months (Venetian Gorgonzola Salad). In each season there are salads that honor saints, such as St. Michael&#39;s Salad, which pairs delicious ripe tomatoes with onions, olives, fresh basil, and mozzarella. There are also salads from countries across the globe, including German Potato Salad, South American Bean Salad, and Indian Curried Lentil Salad. As Brother Victor states in the book&#39;s introduction, &#34;A salad, carefully prepared, is always an occasion for celebration.�?</p><p>Brother Victor-Antoine d&#x2019;Avila-Latourrette was raised in the south of France and trained as a cook in a French monastery. He is the author of six cookbooks including the best-selling Twelve Months of Monastery Soups and From a Monastery Kitchen. A resident Benedictine monk at Our Lady of the Resurrection Monastery, Brother Victor-Antoine serves as a cook and gardener, tending the two gardens and greenhouse that provide the produce and herbs for the monastery. He supplies homemade vinegars, jams, and dried herbs to the Millbrook Winery, where his cookbooks are also sold.A Benedictine monk and nine-time author follows up his <i>Twelve Months of Monastery Soups</i> with a similar ode, this time to the healthful, palate-pleasing salad. D'Avila-Latourrette, resident monk at Our Lady of the Resurrection Monastery, near Millbrook, N.Y., has collected hundreds of eclectic salad recipes from around the world. Arranged by the month, each of these mostly vegetarian salads (some contain egg, cheese or fish) call for the fruits, grains and vegetables appropriate to the season. Salads range from classics such as Caesar Salad and German Potato Salad to rustic Dutch-Style Egg and Cheese Salad, on to more exotic fare, such as Capered Deviled Eggs with Beets and Remoulade Sauce. The recipes are user-friendly and contain helpful suggestions on how and when to serve each dish, as d'Avila-Latourrette tells readers whether a salad is appropriate for a celebration or an outdoor picnic, if it should be served chilled or at room temperature and if it should be eaten before the entr�e or as a palate cleanser before dessert. Each page contains an appropriate and entertaining proverb or brief quote about eating, cooking or the spiritual life. A section on "Salad Basics" and another on "Salad Oils, Vinegars, and Dressings" frame the recipes at the beginning and end of the book, respectively. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The "car guys" held sway, and GM dominated with bold, creative leadership and iconic brands like Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, GMC, and Chevrolet. <br><br> But then GM's leadership began to put their faith in numbers and spreadsheets. Determined to eliminate the "waste" and "personality worship" of the bygone creative leaders, and maximize profitability, management got too smart for its own good. With the bean counters firmly in charge, carmakers, and much of American industry, lost their single-minded focus on product excellence and their competitive advantage. Decline soon followed. <br><br> In 2001, General Motors hired Lutz out of retirement with a mandate to save the company by making great cars again. As vice chairman, he launched a war against the penny-pinching number-crunchers who ran the company by the bottom line, and reinstated a focus on creativity, design, and cars and trucks that would satisfy GM customers. <br><br> After emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, GM is finally back on track thanks in part to its embrace of Lutz's philosophy, with acclaimed new models like the Chevrolet Volt, Cadillac CTS, Chevrolet Equinox, and Buick LaCrosse. <br><br> Lutz's common-sense lessons, combined with a generous helping of fascinating anecdotes, will inspire readers in any industry. As he writes:<br> "It applies in any business. Shoe makers should be run by shoe guys, and software firms by software guys, and supermarkets by supermarket guys. With the advice and support of their bean counters, absolutely, but with the final word going to those who live and breathe the customer experience. Passion and drive for excellence will win over the computer-like, dispassionate, analysis- driven philosophy every time."</p><p><b>BOB LUTZ </b>held senior leadership positions at Gm, ford, Chrysler, and BMW over the course of an unparalleled forty-seven-year career, culminating in his vice chairmanship of General motors from 2001 to 2010.

To her surprise, she found Eleanor Roosevelt taking special notice of her. As their friendship grew, Hickok's devotion to the future first lady so overcame her scruples that she sent drafts of her articles to the head of Roosevelt's campaign for approval. After the election, the women began the passionate correspondence--cheerful and diary-like on Eleanor's side, and stormy on Lorena's--presented here. As suggestive as these letters seemed when they came to light in 1978, they don't demonstrate conclusively whether the women had a sexual affair, only that they became, for three or four years, each other's "dearest." They kissed and caressed each other and dreamt of a life together away from Washington. What is more significant is that these years marked Eleanor Roosevelt's transformation from a supportive wife to an independent political force, and the letters show Hickok's advice and encouragement to be essential to that transformation. Only with Hickok's support did the first lady gain confidence for her remarkable achievements in race relations and expanded roles for women. Good footnotes supplement the text, but the bland introductory notes can be skipped in favor of the women's story in their own words. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Rodger Streitmatter is professor of journalism at American University, where he has taught for more than twenty years.

And you know the saying: What happens in Mexico doesn't stay in Mexico. Or is it the other way around?</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there I was in Cozumel, Mexico, with my family just for the day. When you're on a cruise you can do that -- hop off at a port in one country, spend the day buying monkey heads made out of coconut shells, hop to the next country, spend the day buying pocketbooks made from coconut shells, hop to the next and -- well, you get the picture. </p><p></p><p>We were in Cozumel with a gaggle of other Christian artists like Rebecca St. James, Mark Shultz, the guys and gals from FFH and Avalon, and various agents and promoters. Someone had the great idea that instead of shopping for coconut clothing, coconut furniture, and coconut lamps, we could ride mopeds across the island, have a quaint lunch at a secluded caf� -- away from all the tourists -- and then moped back.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!" my husband and children said. "That sounds like fun!"</p><p></p><p>Me? I had my heart set on the coconut salt and pepper shakers. But I got outvoted, and off we went on our rented mopeds.</p><p></p><p>The trip started out just like I'd imagine the brochure would promise (had there been a brochure). Sunny, sandy, tropical. A gorgeous shoreline that would take your breath away (but then again, so would an errant bug down the windpipe). What no one told us, however -- and the reason there probably was no brochure -- is that for most of the trip, we were going to have to share the road with all the normal traffic. All the normal, speeding traffic.</p><p></p><p>Jeff Allen is a fellow comedian who hates to shop, so he'd talked his wife into the moped jaunt (is that the right word?). At the halfway point she careened into a ravine and nearly broke her leg. Another woman did -- break her leg, that is. And another woman, one who was putt-putt-putting along just ahead of me, simply drove off into the swamp. It was like she never even tried to turn. I was afraid I'd just witnessed suicide-by-moped.</p><p></p><p>My husband and son stopped and helped pull her out of the muck. She was scratched up a bit, but otherwise fine. I still don't know her name. To this day I call her "the-lady-who-almost-died-on-a-moped." But then, there is a busload of people who probably know me only by that name as well. Yes, I too nearly got creamed on a moped. </p><p></p><p>Mopeds are strange animals. Ours were so old and rickety that you had to aim to the left to make the front wheels go in a straight line. Therefore, a right-hand turn was almost impossible. I know because I risked it. And I risked it because a city bus was coming at me head-on. I needed to turn and turn fast. I'd take a swamp over a city bus any day!</p><p></p><p>Now, I was no stranger to "the hog." I'd driven a motorcycle in high school. I know what it feels like to hop on 80cc's of raw power. I'd also learned in high school (besides the fact that it's totally impossible to miss a chicken that decides to cross the road in front of you) that if you jerk the front wheel of a motorcycle with all your might, something will happen.</p><p></p><p>So I turned hard, just as I felt city-bus metal brush against the sleeve of my jacket. <i>So this is how it ends,</i> I remember thinking. Smashed by the <i>Ocho Nueve in Cozumel, Mexico.</i> (That's Bus Number 89 for those of you who don't speak Spanish. And for those of you who do, I won't repeat what I heard coming from the people inside the bus.)</p><p></p><p>I yanked the moped onto the grass and came to a dusty halt. And then I cried. Hard. When I finished, I slowly putt-putted myself back to town and spent the rest of the day buying coconut souvenirs for people I hadn't thought about in years. A near-death experience will do that to you.</p><p></p><p>So thanks to my motorcycle expertise and, no doubt, a whole host of guardian angels, I avoided a nasty crash in a faraway land. What I didn't know at the time was that wiping out on a moped in Cozumel was a breeze compared to the big crash that awaited me in Miami a couple of weeks later.</p><p></p><p>I told you my almost-got-killed-on-a-moped story so that when I explain how I left the cruise ship (it was work, mind you), raced home, did some laundry, and headed back out to a swanky hotel and spa in Miami, you won't hate me. The Miami thing had been planned for a while. You see, I'd held a contest months earlier for my Turbo Host of the Year. (The contestants were the volunteers who helped organize my concerts in each of the towns I visited.) The winner was a sweet young woman named Melanie. The prize? My girlfriends and I took her to be pampered, because that's what girlfriends do when there's a trip to a spa in Miami on the schedule! We chose Super Bowl Sunday for our trip because we knew there'd be no pampering at home; most of our husbands would be too engrossed in the Big Game.</p><p></p><p>I was especially tired that weekend. And I had an upset stomach -- but hey, I had almost been killed in Mexico. Which was another reason to sign up for the Pamper Package: massage, facial, pedicure, manicure, and half a dozen other things that end in cure or massage.</p><p></p><p>Our luxurious beachside accommodations were on the fifteenth floor of the hotel, overlooking the beautiful Atlantic. The little soaps and shampoos in the basket in the bathroom were some kind of high-class rosemary mint stuff -- not your generic soap bars that never lather. Not here! Every liquid or gel at this place had a bit of "oo-la-la" mixed in -- the oils and the perfumes and the moisturizers and even the shoe polish. I didn't want to miss a single amenity. I tried a dab of every bottle, tube, bar, and squeeze pack in the place. (It gave me the same kind of excited feeling I used to get as a kid whenever the government cheese truck would roll through the neighborhood.) I used it all and smelled like a bouquet. Then I washed most of it off, scrubbing especially hard to remove the shoe polish from my wrists and behind my ears.</p><p></p><p>And then there was the spa! That first day we plopped into the hot tub, cooked in the sauna, and boiled in the Jacuzzi. We didn't miss a single body of water. I'm not sure if we were supposed to soak in that cute fountain thing in the foyer or not. (Don't worry, we didn't.) What made it all even better was that back home in Tennessee, it was snowing. Could we have asked for a more perfect weekend?</p><p></p><p>Well, maybe <i>perfect</i> isn't the best word. Like I told you, there was a big crash coming; I just didn't know it. And if you haven't guessed yet, it took place in mid-spa...</p><p></p><p><b>WHERE ARE THE PILLOW MINTS?</b></p><p></p><p>Late Saturday night, nearly two days into our fancy-schmancy pampering weekend, I got a sharp pain in my chest, and I couldn't take a deep breath. "That's okay," one of my friends said. "Just take lots of little breaths." That sounded like good, solid math to me. So I did. I took lots of short, shallow breaths, while my heart raced and panic tried to creep in.</p><p></p><p>"I know what we can do," someone else said. "Let's go to a fancy restaurant." And so we did, because that's what girlfriends do when they're on a fancy-schmancy pampering weekend. And that seemed to take care of the problem -- at least for a while.</p><p></p><p>The next morning I was still having a hard time breathing. I wondered if I was allergic to shoe polish. My girlfriends tried to get to the root of the problem. Someone started a list. Was it the Italian food from the night before? No it started before that. What about the donuts? No, donuts love me. The little mints on the pillows? ("Those <i>were</i> mints, weren't they, girls?" I remember asking.) How about the bag of bagels from the Mexican restaurant across the street? (I know, bagels at a Mexican restaurant? Don't ask!)</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, someone fired up the laptop and began surfing the Internet. We had seaweed wraps and moon-rock massages lined up for the afternoon, so we had to find a cure quick. You know, I have a feeling the Internet will soon be the number one "reason to see a doctor." Somewhere between beyourowndoctor.com and homeremedies-R-us.net (they're not real Web site names, but they'd be great ones, don't you think?), a girl could get killed. I sat on the couch, barely breathing, while the Spa Brigade asked me a battery of questions. After each question someone would move the mouse, and I'd hear a click. After about twenty minutes of pointing and clicking, my friends determined that either (1) I was having a heart attack, (2) I had developed a gallstone, or (3) I needed a lung transplant.</p><p></p><p>After two more point-and-clicks, someone offered another possibility. "Could be that you just crashed into menopause," she said. If it weren't for the fact that I couldn't breathe already, that would have taken my breath away. "You mean, I'm not going to be able to breathe again until I'm sixty-five?"</p><p></p><p>Another sharp pain hit me in the chest, and I began to feel faint. I fell back deeper into the sofa. The plush cushions of the fancy-schmancy hotel felt nice, but the pain in my chest was killing me. I prayed for gallstones.</p><p></p><p>One of the girls on our trip was my friend Alison. I call her Alison the Angel now. She's known me since before high school. She's seen me when I've been healthy and happy and when I've been tired and ill. She's seen me when I've been cranky and irritable and when I've been happy-go-lucky. She's even seen me skinny -- that's how far back we go. But she'd never seen me clutch my chest and fall back on a sofa.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, that's it," she said, moving to the center of the room and pointing a hairbrush as if she were a conductor with a baton. "Nicole, call the front desk and get a cab. Melanie, get Chonda's purse and find her driver's license and medical card. Michelle, dig out the Yellow Pages and find the nearest emergency room."</p><p></p><p>Everything was a blur after that -- that is, until we got to the emergency room. Then everything turned into a slow crawl. I waited for a few hours before finally settling into a bed in the ER (no pillow mints). I waited some more, and then someone wheeled me to x-ray so the doct...</p></p><h2>Life Lessons with Max Lucado: Book Of Psalms</h2><p><p>The Psalms form a praisebook for God's people, a collection of hymns and petitions to lead us in worship.

John Bury shuddered from bow to stern as it plowed through the rolling waters of the Indian Ocean. She was known as a &#x201c;fast freighter,&#x201d; designed to accompany warships and used to traveling at a decent clip, but with all boilers going full out the <i>John Bury</i> was moving at a pace she hadn&#x2019;t seen since her sea trials. Damaged, burning, and trailing smoke, the <i>John Bury</i> was running for her life.</p><p>The ship crested a ten-foot wave, the deck pitched down and the bow dug into another swell. A wide swath of spray kicked up over the rail and whipped back across the deck, rattling what was left of the shattered bridge.</p><p>Topside, the <i>John Bury</i> was a mangled wreck. Smoke poured from twisted metal where rockets had pounded the superstructure. Debris littered the deck, and dead crewmen lay everywhere.</p><p>But the damage was above the waterline, and the fleeing ship would survive if it avoided any more hits.</p><p>On the dark horizon behind, smoke poured from other vessels that had been less fortunate. An orange fireball erupted from one, flashing across the water and briefly illuminating the carnage.</p><p>The burning hulks of four ships could be seen, three destroyers and a cruiser, ships that had been the <i>John Bury&#x2019;s</i> escort. A Japanese submarine and a squadron of dive-bombers had found them simultaneously. As dusk approached, oil burned around the sinking vessels in a mile-long slick. It fouled the sky with dense black smoke. None of them would see the dawn.</p><p>The warships had been targeted and destroyed quickly, but the <i>John Bury</i> had only been strafed, hit with rockets and left to run free. There could be only one reason for that mercy; the Japanese knew of the top secret cargo she carried and they wanted it for themselves.</p><p>Captain Alan Pickett was determined not to let that happen, even with half his crew dead and his face gashed by shrapnel. He grabbed the voice tube and shouted down to the engine room.</p><p>&#x201c;More speed!&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>There was no response. At last report a fire had been raging belowdecks. Pickett had ordered his men to stay and fight it, but now the silence left him gripped with fear.</p><p>&#x201c;Zekes off the port bow!&#x201d; a lookout called from the bridge wing. &#x201c;Two thousand feet and dropping.&#x201d;</p><p>Pickett glanced through the shattered glass in front of him. In the failing light he saw four black dots wheeling in the gray sky and dropping toward the ship. Flashes lit from their wings.</p><p>&#x201c;Get down!&#x201d; he shouted.</p><p>Too late. Fifty caliber shells stitched a line across the ship, cutting the lookout in half and blasting apart what was left of the bridge. Shards of wood, glass and steel flew about the compartment.</p><p>Pickett hit the deck. A wave of heat flashed over the bridge as another rocket hit ahead of it. The impact rocked the ship, peeling back the metal ceiling like a giant can opener.</p><p>As the wave of destruction passed, Pickett looked up. The last of his officers lay dead, the bridge was demolished. Even the ship&#x2019;s wheel was gone, with only a stub of metal still attached to the spindle. Yet somehow the vessel chugged on.</p><p>As Pickett climbed back up, he spotted something that gave him hope: dark clouds and sweeping bands of rain. A squall line was moving in fast off the starboard bow. If he could get his ship into it, the coming darkness would hide him.</p><p>Holding on to the bulkhead for support, he reached for what remained of the wheel. He pushed with all the strength he had left. It moved half a turn, and he fell to the ground holding it.</p><p>The ship began to change course.</p><p>Pressing against the deck, he pushed the wheel upward and then brought it back down again for another full revolution.</p><p>The freighter was leaning into the turn now, drawing a curved white wake on the ocean&#x2019;s surface, coming around toward the squall.</p><p>The clouds ahead were thick. The rain falling from them was sweeping the surface like a giant broom. For the first time since the attack began, Pickett felt they had a chance, but as the ship plowed toward the squall the awful sound of the dive-bombers turning and plunging toward him again put that in doubt.</p><p>He searched through the ship&#x2019;s gaping wounds for the source of that noise.</p><p>Dropping from the sky directly in front of him were two Aichi D3A dive-bombers, Vals, the same type the Japanese had used with deadly effect at Pearl Harbor and months later against the British fleet near Ceylon.</p><p>Pickett watched them nose over and listened as the whistling sound of their wings grew louder. He cursed at them and pulled his sidearm.</p><p>&#x201c;Get away from my ship!&#x201d; he shouted, blasting at them with the Colt .45.</p><p>They pulled up at the last minute and roared past, riddling the ship with another spread of .50 caliber shells. Pickett fell back onto the deck, a shell clean through his leg, shattering it. His eyes opened, gazing upward. He was unable to move.</p><p>Waves of smoke and gray sky rolled above him. He was finished, he thought. The ship and its secret cargo would soon fall into enemy hands.</p><p>Pickett cursed himself for not scuttling the ship. He hoped it would somehow go down on its own before it could be boarded.</p><p>As his eyesight began to fail, the sound of more dive-bombers caught his ear. The roar grew louder, the banshee scream from their wings calling out and announcing the terrible inevitability of the end.</p><p>And then the sky above darkened. The air turned cold and wet, and the S.S. <i>John Bury</i> disappeared into the storm, swallowed up by a wall of mist and rain.</p><p>She was last reported by a Japanese pilot as burning but sailing under full power. She was never seen or heard from again.</p><p></p><p></p><b>Chapter One</b><p></p><p><b>Northern Yemen, near the Saudi border August 1967</b></p><p>Tariq al-Khalif hid his face behind a cloth of soft white cotton.

It kept the sun, wind and sand from his weather-beaten features as it hid him from the world.</p><p>Only Khalif&#x2019;s eyes showed, hard and sharp from sixty years in the desert. They did not blink or turn away as he stared at the dead bodies in the sand before him.</p><p>Eight bodies in all. Two men, three women, three children; stripped naked, all clothes and belongings gone. Most had been shot, a few had been stabbed.</p><p>As the camel train at Khalif&#x2019;s back waited, a rider moved slowly up toward him. Khalif recognized the strong, young figure in the saddle. A man named Sabah, his most trusted lieutenant. A Russian-made AK-47 lay slung over his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Bandits for certain,&#x201d; Sabah said. &#x201c;No sign of them now.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif studied the rough sand at his feet. He noticed the tracks disappearing to the west, headed directly toward the only source of water for a hundred miles, an oasis called Abi Quzza&#x2014;the &#x201c;silken water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, my friend,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;These men are not waiting around to be discovered. They hide their numbers by sticking to the hard ground, where no tracks are left, or they walk on the softest sand, where the marks soon fade. But here I can see the truth, they&#x2019;re heading toward our home.&#x201d;</p><p>Abi Quzza had belonged to Khalif&#x2019;s family for generations. It provided life-giving water and a modicum of wealth. Date palms grew in abundance around its fertile springs, along with grass for the sheep and camels.</p><p>With the growing number of trucks and other forms of modern transportation, the caravans that paid for its gifts had begun to dwindle, and the role of camel-raising Bedouins like Khalif and his family were fading along with them, but they were not yet gone. For the clan to have any prospects at all, Khalif knew the oasis must be protected.</p><p>&#x201c;Your sons will defend it,&#x201d; Sabah said.</p><p>The oasis lay twenty miles to the west. Khalif&#x2019;s sons, two nephews and their families waited there. A half dozen tents, ten men with rifles. It would not be an easy place to attack. And yet Khalif felt a terrible unease.</p><p>&#x201c;We must hurry,&#x201d; he said, climbing back onto his camel.</p><p>Sabah nodded. He slid the AK-47 forward to a more aggressive position and nudged his camel forward.</p><p>Three hours later they approached the oasis. From a distance they could see nothing but small fires. There were no signs of struggle, no ripped tents or stray animals, no bodies lying in the sand.</p><p>Khalif ordered the camel train to a halt and dismounted. He took Sabah and two others, moving forward on foot.</p><p>The silence around them was so complete, they could hear the crackle of wood in the fires and their own feet scuffling in the sand. Somewhere in the distance, a jackal began to yelp. It was a long way off, but the noise carried in the desert.</p><p>Khalif halted, waiting for the jackal&#x2019;s call to fade. When it died away, a more pleasant sound followed: a small voice singing a traditional Bedouin melody. It came from the main tent and fl owed quietly.</p><p>Khalif began to relax. It was the voice of his youngest son, Jinn.</p><p>&#x201c;Bring the caravan,&#x201d; Khalif said. &#x201c;All is well.&#x201d;</p><p>As Sabah and the others went back to the camels, Khalif walked forward. He reached his tent, threw open the flap, and froze.</p><p>A bandit dressed in rags stood there, holding a curved blade to his son&#x2019;s throat. Another bandit sat beside him, clutching an old rifle.</p><p>&#x201c;One move and I slice his neck,&#x201d; the bandit said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am Masiq,&#x201d; the bandit said.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Khalif asked.</p><p>Masiq shrugged. &#x201c;What don&#x2019;t we want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The camels have value,&#x201d; Khalif said, guessing what they were after. &#x201c;I will give them to you. Just spare my family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your offer is meaningless to me,&#x201d; Masiq replied, his face twisting into a snarl of contempt. &#x201c;Because I can take what I want, and because . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;he gripped the boy tightly&#x2014;&#x201c;except for this one, your family is already dead.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif&#x2019;s heart tightened. Inside his tunic was a Webley- Fosbery automatic revolver. The self-cocking revolver was a sturdy weapon with deadly accuracy. It wouldn&#x2019;t jam even after months in the desert sand. He tried to think of a way to reach it.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll give you everything,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;just for him. And you can go free.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have gold hidden here,&#x201d; Masiq said as if it were a known fact. &#x201c;Tell us where it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif shook his head. &#x201c;I have no gold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lies,&#x201d; the second bandit said.</p><p>Masiq began to laugh, his crooked teeth and decay-filled mouth making a horrific sound. Gripping the boy tightly with one arm, he raised the other as if to slice the boy&#x2019;s neck. But the child slipped loose, lunged for Masiq&#x2019;s fingers with his mouth and bit down hard.</p><p>Masiq cursed in pain. His hand snapped back as if he&#x2019;d been burned.</p><p>Khalif&#x2019;s own hand found the revolver and he blasted two shots right through his tunic. The would-be murderer fell backward, two smoking holes in his chest.</p><p>The second bandit fired, grazing Khalif&#x2019;s leg, but Khalif&#x2019;s shot hit him square in the face. The man fell without a word, but the battle had only just begun.</p><p>Outside the tent, gunfire began to echo through the night. Shots were being traded, volleys flying back and forth. Khalif recognized the sound of heavy bolt-action rifles, like the one in the dead thug&#x2019;s hand, they were answered by the rattling sound of Sabah and his automatic rifle.</p><p>Khalif grabbed his son, placing the pistol in the young boy&#x2019;s hand. He picked up the old rifle from beside one of the dead bandits. He plucked the curved knife from the ground as well and moved deeper into the tent.</p><p>His older sons lay there as if resting side by side. Their clothes were soaked with dark blood and riddled with holes.</p><p>A wave of pain swept over Khalif; pain and bitterness and anger.</p><p>With the gunfire raging outside, he stuck the knife into the side of the tent and cut a small hole. Peering through it, he saw the battle.</p><p>Sabah and three of the men were firing from behind a shield of dead camels. A group of thugs dressed like the bandits he&#x2019;d just killed were out in the oasis itself, hiding behind date palms in knee-high water.</p><p>There did not seem to be enough of them to have taken the camp by force.</p><p>He turned to Jinn. &#x201c;How did these men get here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They asked to stay,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;We watered their camels.&#x201d;</p><p>That they&#x2019;d played on the tradition of Bedouin generosity and the kindness of Khalif&#x2019;s sons before killing them enraged Khalif further. He went to the other side of the tent. This time he plunged the knife into the fabric and drew it sharply downward.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay here,&#x201d; he ordered Jinn.</p><p>Khalif snuck through the opening and worked his way into the darkness. Moving in a wide arc, he curled in behind his enemies and slipped into the oasis.</p><p>Preoccupied with Sabah and his men at their front, the bandits never noticed Khalif flanking them. He came up behind them and opened fire, blasting them in the back from close range.</p><p>Three went down quickly and then a fourth. Another tried to run and was killed by a shot from Sabah, but the sixth and final thug turned around in time and fired back.</p><p>A slug hit Khalif&#x2019;s shoulder, knocking him backward and</p><p>sending a jolt of pain surging though his body. He landed in the water.</p><p>The bandit rushed toward him, perhaps thinking him dead or too wounded to fight.</p><p>Khalif aimed the old rifle and pulled the trigger. The shell jammed in the breach. He grabbed the bolt and worked to free it, but his wounded arm was not strong enough to break loose the frozen action.</p><p>The bandit raised his own weapon, drawing a bead on Khalif&#x2019;s chest. And then the sound of the Webley revolver rang out like thunder.</p><p>The bandit fell against a date palm with a puzzled look on his face. He slid down it, the weapon falling from his hands into the water.</p><p>Jinn stood behind the dead man, holding the pistol in a shaking grip, his eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Khalif looked around for more enemies, but he saw none. The shooting had stopped. He could hear Sabah shouting to the men. The battle was over.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here, Jinn,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>His son moved toward him, shaking and trembling. Khalif took him under one arm and held him.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at me.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy did not respond.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at me, Jinn!&#x201d;</p><p>Finally Jinn turned. Khalif held his shoulder tightly.</p><p>&#x201c;You are too young to understand, my son, but you have done a mighty thing. You have saved your father. You have saved your family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But my brothers and mother are dead,&#x201d; Jinn cried.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Khalif said. &#x201c;They are in paradise, and we will go on, until we meet them one day.&#x201d;</p><p>Jinn did not react, he only stared and sobbed.</p><p>A sound from the right turned Khalif. One of the bandits was alive and trying to crawl away.</p><p>Khalif raised the curved knife, ready to finish the man, but then held himself back. &#x201c;Kill him, Jinn.&#x201d;</p><p>The shaking boy stared blankly. Khalif stared back, firm and unyielding.</p><p>&#x201c;Your brothers are dead, Jinn. The future of the clan rests with you. You must learn to be strong.&#x201d;</p><p>Jinn continued to shake, but Khalif was all the more certain now. Kindness and generosity had almost destroyed them. Such weakness had to be banished from his only surviving son.</p><p>&#x201c;You...</p></p><h2>The Amazing World of Gumball Original Graphic Novel: Fairy Tale Trouble (1)</h2><p>Based on the success of the Adventure Time and Regular Show original graphic novels, KaBOOM! is kicking off a series of brand-new stories about the misadventures of Gumball and Darwin!</p><p>Benjamin &#34;Ben&#34; Bocquelet is a French-born English animator, writer, and producer, best known as the creator of The Amazing World of Gumball of which he also co-writes alongside James Lamont and Jon Foster.</p><h2>LEGO City: Fix That Truck!</h2><p>Spend a day at the garage fixing trucks in this funny LEGO(R) City storybook!<br><br>Eric is spending the day working at his dad's LEGO(R) City garage.

For six hundred years, the Empire swelled and declined. Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, in three centuries it advanced from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at the Empire's height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched its aid. For the next three hundred years the Empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. Early in the twentieth century it fell. In this dazzling evocation of its power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In the process he unfolds a sequence of mysteries, triumphs, treasures, and terrors unknown to most American readers.<br><br>This was a place where pillows spoke and birds were fed in the snow; where time itself unfolded at a different rate and clocks were banned; where sounds were different, and even the hyacinths too strong to sniff. Dramatic and passionate, comic and gruesome, Lords of the Horizons is a history, a travel book, and a vision of a lost world all in one.<br></p><p>Jason Goodwin, a young English journalist, writes history as if it were today's breaking news, and with <i>Lords of the Horizon</i>, he delivers an anecdote-filled and breezy account of the long, troubled career of the Ottoman Empire. That empire endured for nearly 600 years and embraced not only a large territory--stretching, at one point, from the border of Iran to the gates of Vienna--but also hundreds of ethnic groups and three dozen nations. United under the banner of a tolerant form of Islam, the Ottoman Turks forged a culture that, Goodwin writes, "was such a prodigy of pep, such a miracle of human ingenuity, that contemporaries felt it was helped into being by powers not quite human--diabolical or divine, depending on their point of view."<p> Drawing on memoirs by European visitors as well as standard histories of the era, Goodwin traces the Ottoman Empire from its origins in the 14th-century collapse of the Byzantine state to its centuries-long decline and final collapse at the end of World War I. Along the way, he writes of the Ottomans' addiction to wealth (and to hiding their gold in fabulous hoards), the pleasure they took in holding picnics in their lush cemeteries, and the prowess of their elite military both in battle and in organized crime. ("The janissaries were magnificent extortionists," Goodwin notes. "People paid them not to burn their homes and business, then they paid them to come and put the fires out.") Full of vivid detail, Goodwin's narrative makes for an enjoyable introduction to this historically influential, but little understood, culture. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Historian, journalist, and travel writer, Jason Goodwin lives in West Sussex, England, with his wife and two sons.

Right off the bat, she comes across a pig wearing sandwich boards advertising the need for a leading lady in the World Mother Goose Theatre. Jennie leaps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the position requires someone with experience, so she sets off to find it. One hungry lion and a stubborn un-hungry baby later, Jennie definitely has experience, if nothing else anymore, and off she goes to play the leading role in a nursery-rhyme-turned-theatrical-production: <blockquote> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> The dog has eaten the mop!<br> The pig's in a hurry<br> The cat's in a flurry<br> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> </blockquote> This dreamy, slightly dark story, illustrated in Sendak's renowned pen-and-ink style, tells of a gluttonous dog's transformation from someone who cares only about her next salami sandwich to one who would risk her life for a weaker being (while still wondering where that next sandwich is coming from).

Today's researchers are continuing to confirm the remarkable, life-giving properties of true extra-virgin, and "extra-virgin Italian" has become the highest standard of quality.<br><br> But what if this symbol of purity has become deeply corrupt? Starting with an explosive article in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Tom Mueller has become the world's expert on olive oil and olive oil fraud-a story of globalization, deception, and crime in the food industry from ancient times to the present, and a powerful indictment of today's lax protections against fake and even toxic food products in the United States. A rich and deliciously readable narrative, <em>Extra Virginity</em> is also an inspiring account of the artisanal producers, chemical analysts, chefs, and food activists who are defending the extraordinary oils that truly deserve the name "extra-virgin." 25 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2011</strong>: E.V.O.O. just got a whole lot more complicated. Tom Mueller's <i>Extra Virginity</i> is about as explosive as an expose can get, at least if your subject is liquid fat. The road from tree to table, it turns out, is fraught with corruption, fraud, and laboratory interventions. Mueller shows how and why the trade in adulterated olive oil is about as profitable as the trade in some hard drugs, and with a lot less risk, too. There are equally entertaining detours into olive oil's long history, the politics of regulation and enforcement, and even debates over the best way to taste it (swirl, aerate, spit, or just swig?). All in all, it's a great read not just for foodies, but also for anyone interested in the complexities of global trade and organized crime. <em>--Darryl Campbell</em><br>Tom Mueller writes for The New Yorker and other publications. He lives in a medieval stone farmhouse surrounded by olive groves in the Ligurian countryside outside of Genoa, Italy.</p><h2>Destroyer of Worlds</h2><p>Worlds closer to the galatic core than Known Space are --or were-- home to intelligent speciers.

He lives in Virginia with his wife, Ruth.<br><br><br>1<br>Intelligence was overrated. <br>Not unimportant, merely not the everything that many made intelligence out to be. Intelligence leapt instantly, inexorably, from the merest observation to subtle implication to profound deduction to utter certainty. Intelligence laid bare the threats, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that lurked every�where. Intelligence understood that other minds all around raced to similar conclusions&#x2014; <br>And that countless rivals would take immediate action thereon. <br>To become a protector, awakening into intelligence, was to lose all in�nocence, and with it the ability ever to let down one&#x2019;s guard. <br>But&nbsp; here, now, so very far from home, things&nbsp; were different. <br>Thssthfok stood alone atop a glacial vastness, clad only in a thin vest, worn for its pockets rather than for warmth. His hard, leathery skin was proof against the cold, at least for short periods. A portable shelter stood a few steps away, his shuttlecraft not much more distant. <br>The air was clean and crisp and bland in his nostrils. The oceans of this pristine world teemed with life, mostly&nbsp; single- celled, but the land remained barren. There were no native predators to fear&nbsp; here. As for protectors, the most formidable of predators, within a&nbsp; day- tenth&#x2019;s travel, there was only himself. <br>The children and breeders Thssthfok lived to protect&nbsp; were all on Pakhome, incommunicably distant. Their safety had been entrusted to kin and further guaranteed, to the extent that was possible, with hostages, prom�ised rewards, and dire threats. Without such mea sures,Thssthfok could never have come. That would have been unfortunate, for if this mission succeeded, all in clan Rilchuk might enjoy the greatest possible protection&#x2014; <br>Release from the endless wars of Pakhome. <br>The only sound, but for the wind, was the whir of powerful electric motors laboring to extract deep core samples. Locked into the glacier was a story eons in the making, written in layers of ice, traces of ash, and mi�croscopic bubbles of trapped gases. <br>Thssthfok was&nbsp; here to read it. <br>The concentrations of trapped gases would speak of the evolving cli�mate. The traces of ash would reveal the frequency of volcanic eruptions. Occasional dustings of rare metals like iridium would disclose the impacts of large meteors. Patterns in the thickness of layers would speak to .uctua�tions in ocean volume and worldwide ice cover. That information, and the detailed observations of newly emplaced satellites, and the mea sured orbital pa rame ters of this world . . . together they would reveal much about the long- term suitability of this place. <br>For this world offered far more temperate climes. Suitably prepared, much of the land here might be as pleasant as the great savannahs on which the Pak had&nbsp; evolved&#x2014;if present conditions persisted. Planetary engineering took time and great resources. To relocate the entire clan&#x2014; hundreds of protectors and many thousand children and&nbsp; breeders&#x2014; would be a massive undertaking. Thssthfok had crossed a hundred&nbsp; light- years to answer a single question: How variable was the climate&nbsp; here? <br>He needed core samples, drilling as far back in time as he could get. A climate forecast rooted only in today&#x2019;s data was no more than a guess, and no basis for casting the fate of everything he held dear. The ice would yield its secrets, but the ice refused to be rushed.... <br>And so, remote from danger, removed from any clues to the circum�stances of his breeders, Thssthfok was safe.&nbsp; Safe&#x2014; unlike almost anywhere, anytime, on&nbsp; Pakhome&#x2014;to disregard the outside world. Safe to ignore past and future. Safe to immerse himself, unprotectorlike, in an unending pres�ent. Safe to return to an age before thought. <br>Safe to dream of his time as a breeder . . . <br>THSSTHFOK REMEMBERED. <br>He remembered hunting and mating and .ghting and exploring, al�ways with zest. He remembered being curious about everything and un�derstanding almost nothing. He remembered his pride in the ability to fashion a pitiful few tools: sharpened sticks, chipped- stone implements, straps cut from cured animal hide. He remembered staring, awestruck, into camp.res. He remembered conversing with&nbsp; family&#x2014; if the concepts expressible in a few hundred grunts and gestures could be called conver�sation. <br>The world then was ever new and exciting and usually inexplicable. Sometimes, when people died, a reason was obvious: torn by wild beasts, or fallen from a great height, or impaled on a spear. But many deaths came without warning or reason, with only the onset of bad scents to explain. <br>For scent was everything: how one found or avoided one&#x2019;s enemies; how one bonded with one&#x2019;s family; how one was drawn to mates and knew one&#x2019;s own children. <br>He remembered the rich, warm scent of family. Every person had a unique smell, and yet the subtleties of that aroma declared one&#x2019;s lineage for generations. He was not called Thssthfok then. There were no names, for names&nbsp; were not necessary. To smell relationships suf.ced. <br>Scent was everything, and death was everywhere, and life&#x2014; <br>Life was intense. <br>Lightning and starlight, seasons and tides, the ways of beasts and the wants of the mysterious beings occasionally glimpsed at a distance (and even less often, intervening) . . . all&nbsp; were unfathomable and wondrous. <br>For all their poignancy and grip, those memories&nbsp; were indistinct. A breeder merely dipped a toe into the great sea of sapience. <br>And then, one day, as happened to all breeders who reached a suitable age, he smelled . . . <br>Heaven. <br>Heaven was another vague concept for breeders. As they threw rocks and spears, so, obviously, far mightier beings hurled the lightning. Who but gods could carry sun and moon across the sky? Who but gods could arrange the stars and command the phases of the moon? Perhaps, as many thought, the gods descended from heaven and took mortal form to visit their people. It would explain the mysterious strangers and their magic implements. And since heaven was surely a better place, it would explain why the mysterious strangers came so seldom. <br>Heaven, it turned out, was not in the sky. <br>Heaven was a tree, scarcely more than a shrub, ordinary in every way, passed many times before, entirely familiar. On that day it exuded a scent of irresistible potency. Suddenly he had found himself prone at its roots, scratching with his bare hands at the rocky soil. The smell urged him for�ward, downward, indifferent to torn .ngernails and .ayed skin and the blood streaming from his hands. He must .nd&#x2014; <br>He did not know what. <br>Fingers digging madly found a gnarled, yellow-orange length of tree root. The scent grew overpowering. When next he was aware of himself, his stomach was painfully engorged. His jaws worked mindlessly on a mouthful of something almost too .brous to chew. He was .at on his back beside a length of exposed tree root, from which a few&nbsp; rough- skinned tubers still clung. Sap oozed where more tubers had surely been ripped loose. In some dim recess of his thoughts, he knew it was a tuber like these on which he helplessly gnawed. <br>All around was a stench that part of him wanted to .ee and part of him recognized was somehow himself. That his very scent could change was terrifying. Yet another part of him noted, with unusual clarity, that what�ever had overcome him had left him helpless. This reek, if it repelled oth�ers as much as himself, was all that kept away his enemies. <br>The new smell was already fading, changing to yet another odor, some�thing strangely right for him. How could that be? What more had changed? In a panic, he explored his body. <br>His hair had fallen out in clumps, from head and chest and limbs. His knees and elbows and hips protruded, magically become enormous. The knuckles of his hands&nbsp; were sore and enlarged. His mouth felt odd, the skin pulled unaccountably taut. When, fearfully, he explored with the hand un�encumbered with a&nbsp; half- eaten tuber, his lips and gums&nbsp; were becoming one. His cheeks felt like cured animal hide. He patted his chest and legs and other arm. They, too, were becoming tough. He peered fearfully at his most personal parts&#x2014; and they were gone! <br>He howled, his anguish muf.ed by a mouthful of the root that had maimed him. And yet . . . Despite pain and shock and confusion, he could not help but notice: His thoughts had never been clearer. He continued to chew. <br>THE DRONING OF MACHINERY CHANGED pitch as another deep ice core neared the surface. <br>Thssthfok returned from the eternal present of a breeder into this pres�ent, awakening into a deep sense of loss. Breeders felt. Then, he had been one with the land, one with his family, passionate about every experience. <br>Intelligence was a pale substitute. <br>Only one emotion remained to him, all the more intense for subsuming the rest: He must protect those left behind. Not his&nbsp; children&#x2014; for they were long gone, whether dead or transformed like him by tree- of- life root&#x2014; but their children&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s children, and their children besides. <br>As many generations must pass again before Thssthfok would return, while by ship time, coming and going at near light speed, hardly six years would have passed. He himself would have aged even less, his biological processes slowed to near immobility in cold sleep. <br>Scent and memory were inextricably linked. With home fresh in Thssth�fok&#x2019;s thoughts, the sterile, scentless air above this windswept ice oppressed him. Perhaps he would return for a while to the expedition&#x2019;s main base on the&nbsp; south- temperate continent, where the geologists and biologists labored. There he would .nd the scents of relatives, if only the weak emanations of other protectors. Shipboard, at least, there&nbsp; were synthesized scents. The best work of perfumers paled beside the heady, blended...<br><br></p><h2>Old Testament Theology</h2><p>The discipline of Old Testament theology continues to be in flux as diverse approaches vie for dominance. Into the stream Paul R. House sends this student-friendly offering that should prove useful to a wide audience. Following introductory chapters on the history of the discipline and his own method, House discusses the theological emphases of each book in the order of the Hebrew canon. Readers with little prior background will find House&#39;s thematic surveys particularly helpful for coming to grips with basic biblical content as well as for probing the theological nuances of individual parts of the canon. The book concludes by forging a set of summary statements concerning God and his character, the people of God, and links between the Old and New Testaments that suggest avenues for the exploration of a full biblical theology.</p><p>Paul R. House teaches at Beeson Divinity School of Samford University (Birmingham, Alabama). An Old Testament scholar, he has taught previously at Taylor University, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Wheaton College.Goldingay clearly and strongly affirms the entire trustworthiness and authority of Scripture, and he underlines its theological significance in its parts and entirety. (Barbara Green, Dominical School of Theology and Philosophy, Berkeley, Theological Studies 68, 2007)<br><br>"Gerhard Hasel, a keen American advocate and analyst of biblical theology, proposed more than a decade ago that the theology of each individual biblical book be examined before synthesizing the whole. House has followed through on Hasel's program admirably. The results are impressive. His synthesis of the Old Testament, moreover, in which monotheism becomes the focal point, is clearly pertinent in a pluralistic religious world. Here is a passionate but mature exposition, crisply, often memorably, articulated. The book marches alongside recent full-blown volumes on Old Testament theology; this full-scale treatment offers a viable, compelling and evangelical alternative. It's a good read." (Elmer A. Martens, professor emeritus of Old Testament, Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary)<br><br>"Paul House employs his considerable talent and command of the literature to produce a remarkably insightful and stimulating theology of the Old Testament. His book-by-book approach is not only a contribution to scholarly discussion but also an invaluable resource for pastors and lay teachers of the Bible. I enthusiastically recommend this engagingly written and provocative volume as required reading for the serious student."

He rides his horse, Warrior, picks up the trail of mustangs, then runs with them day and night until they accept his presence. Bob and Warrior must then challenge the stallion for leadership of the wild herd. A victorious Bob leads the mustangs across the wide plains and for one last spectacular run before guiding them into the corral. Bob's job is done, but he dreams of galloping with Warrior forever to where the sky and land meet.<br><br>This splendid collaboration by an award-winning team captures the beauty and harshness of the frontier, a boundless arena for the struggle between freedom and survival. Based on accounts of Bob Lemmons, a former slave, <i>Black Cowboy, Wild Horses</i> has been rewritten as a picture book by Julius Lester from his story "The Man Who Was a Horse" in <i>Long Journey Home</i>, first published by Dial in 1972.</p><p>Born in 1939, Julius Lester spent his youth in the Midwest and the South and received a B.A. in English from Fisk University in 1960.<p>Since 1968 he has published 25 books of fiction, nonfiction, children's books, and poetry. Among the awards these books have received are the Newbery Honor Medal, American Library Association Notable Book, National Jewish Book Award Finalist, <i>The New York Times</i> Outstanding Book, National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist, Caldecott Honor Book, the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, and a National Book Award Finalist. His books have been translated into eight languages.</p><p>He has published more than one hundred essays and reviews in such publications <i>The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times </i>Op-Ed Page,<i>The Boston Globe, The Village Voice, The New Republic, Katallagete, Moment, Forward, and Dissent</i>.</p><p>He has recorded two albums of original songs, hosted and produced a radio show on WBAI-FM in New York City for eight years, and hosted a live television show on WNET in New York for two years. A veteran of the Civil Rights Movement, his photographs of that movement are included in an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution and are part of the permanent photographic collection at Howard University.</p><p>After teaching at the New School for Social Research for two years, Mr. Lester joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst in 1971 where he is presently a full professor in the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies Department, and adjunct professor in the English and History departments. He also serves as lay religious leader of Beth El Synagogue in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.</p><p>He has been awarded all four of the university's most prestigious faculty awards: The Distinguished Teacher's Award; the Faculty Fellowship Award for Distinguished Research and Scholarship; Distinguished Faculty Lecturer; and recipient of the Chancellor's Medal, the University's highest honor. In 1986 the Council for Advancement and Support of Education selected him as the Massachusetts State Professor of the Year.</p><p>Mr. Lester's biography has appeared in <i>Who's Who In America</i> since 1970. He has given lectures and papers at more than 100 colleges and universities.</p><p>His most recent books are <i>John Henry, And All Our Wounds Forgiven</i>, a novel about the civil rights movement, and <i>Othello</i>, a novel based on the Shakespeare play.</p><p>Jerry Pinkney has been illustrating children's books since 1964 and has the rare distinction of being the recipient of:</p><p>Five Caldecott Honor Medals</p><p>Five Coretta Scott King Awards</p><p>Four New York Times Best Illustrated Awards (most recently 2006 <i>Little Red Hen</i>)</p><p>Four Gold and four Silver medals from the Society of Illustrators</p><p>Boston Globe Honor Book Award (<i>John Henry</i> 1994)</p><p>In addition to his work on children's books, he is an extremely successful artist who has had eleven one-man retrospectives at venues ranging from the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists to the Art Institute of Chicago. His current one-man show entitled, "Building Bridges, the Art of Jerry Pinkney" was organized by the Pittsburgh Children's Museum and will be traveling through 1998. Mr. Pinkney has illustrated for a wide variety of clients, including <i>National Geographic</i> , the National Parks Service, the U.S. Postal Service, the <i>American Library Association</i> and the <i>Association of Booksellers for Children</i>.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1939, Jerry Pinkney states, "(I) took an interest in drawing very early in my life, and at some point I realized I'd rather sit and draw than do almost anything else." While growing up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia his interest in art was supported by hisfamily -- especially by his mother. "She certainly understood me and made it clear to everyone that if art was what I wanted to pursue, then that's what she wanted to have happen. My father also became very supportive, and when I wanted to take art classes after school he found ways for me to attend."</p><p>In junior high school Mr. Pinkney had a newsstand and took a drawing pad with him to work every day and sketched passersby. That was how he met the cartoonist John Liney, who encouraged him to draw and showed him the possibilities of making a living as an artist.</p><p>After graduating from the commercial art program at Dobbins Vocational School, where he met his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, Jerry Pinkney received a full scholarship to attend the Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now University of the Arts). While at PCA he and Gloria married. After their first child was born, they moved to Boston, where Mr. Pinkney worked as a designer at Rustcraft Greeting Card Company, and at Barker-Black Studio where he developed his reputation as an illustrator. Eventually he opened Kaleidoscope Studio with two other artists. Later he opened his own freelance studio -- Jerry Pinkney Studio -- and moved to New York. Sensitivity to and an interest in a variety of cultures has always been a dominant theme of Mr. Pinkney s work. He has also drawn inspiration for a significant part of his work from African American culture. Among his numerous projects are his twelve postage stamps for the U.S. Postal Service Black Heritage series. Mr. Pinkney was a member of its Advisory Committee for ten years and he was also invited to join the NASA artist team for the space shuttle Columbia. "I wanted to show that an African American artist could make it on a national level in the graphic arts. I want to be a strong role model for my family and for other African Americans."</p><p>Many of Mr. Pinkney's children's books celebrate multicultural and African American themes. "Working on both the <i>Uncle Remus</i> tales and <i>John Henry</i> has shown me an important link between pivotal and opposite African American folk heroes. Brer Rabbit, the sly trickster, originated during slavery and was the first African American folk hero. Slaves who wanted to get the better of their masters needed to be cunning and sly -- hence the trickster role. However, later comes John Henry, a free man, whose strength and valor bring him fame. He was a strong folk hero for African Americans, a symbol of all the working men who made a major contribution to the building of the roads and railroads in the mountains of West Virginia &#x2014;a dangerous job for which many paid with their lives."</p><p>Mr. Pinkney's two latest books are<i>The Little Red Hen</i> and <i>The Old African</i> by Julius Lester (illustrated by Jerry Pinkney). Books give me a great feeling of personal and artistic satisfaction. When I'm working on a book, I wish the phone would never ring. I love doing it. My satisfaction comes from the actual marks on the paper, and when it sings, it's magic".</p><p>Jerry and Gloria Pinkney live in Westchester County, New York. The Pinkneys have four children: Troy, Scott, Brian, and Myles, and seven grandchildren. Two of the Pinkney's children are also involved in children's book illustration, Brian through illustrations, and Myles throughphotography. In addition to illustrating children's books and other projects, Mr. Pinkney has also been an art professor at the University of Delaware and State University of New York at Buffalo. He has given workshops and been a guest lecturer at universities and art schools across thecountry.</p><b><b>An Author's Note</b></b><br>by Julius LesterThis is a true story based on the life of a black cowboy named Bob Lemmons. He is mentioned in two books: <i>The Adventures of the Negro Cowboys</i> by Philip Durham and <i>The Mustangs</i> by Everett L. Jones and J. Frank Dobie. In the latter there is an interview with Lemmons when he was in his eighties. I told this story first in my book <i>Long Journey Home: Stories from Black History</i> (Dial Books, 1972, reissued 1993). The present version was inspired by a fascination with black cowboys that Jerry Pinkney and I discovered we share. Jerry sent me a copy of a 1975 calendar he illustrated depicting blacks in the West and said he would love to do a book about black cowboys. I sent him a copy of <i>Long Journey Home</i> and asked him to read <i>?The Man Who Was a Horse.?</i> He read it and said he would love to illustrate it, but thought it would be very difficult to rewrite the story as a picture book. I didn?t tell him that I thought the real hard work was going to be the illustrations. May we each keep believing that our job is the easier one. <br><b><b>An Author's Note</b></b><br>by Jerry PinkneyAs a young boy growing up in Philadelphia, PA, I dreamed of exploring the Wild West. My friends and I played cowboys, and with great enthusiasm we became characters portrayed on the silver screen. What fun we had. Today I wonder how our role-playing and self-esteem would have been enhanced had we known about Nat Love, the black cowboy, Bill Pickett, the black rodeo star, and the fact that one out of three cowboys was black or Mexican. Some thirty years later I got my chance to play cowboys again, with a project I created for an African-American history calendar. The subject was the Black West, and it was that calendar I shared with Julius Lester. So again, some twenty-two years later I am playing cowboys. This time I am illustrating the story of Bob Lemmons, herding wild horses on the western plains. My gear is the finely crafted text written by Julius and my ever increasing appetite for American history. It is also the mounting research on this nation?s true West, with -- of course -- cowboys of color. Published by Dial Books <br>A member of Penguin Putnam Inc.<br>375 Hudson Street ?

Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.<br><br>Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In W<i>hen: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing</i>, Pink shows that timing is really a science.<br><br>Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?<br><br>In <i>When</i>, Pink distills cutting-edge research and data on timing and synthesizes them into a fascinating, readable narrative packed with irresistible stories and practical takeaways that give readers compelling insights into how we can live richer, more engaged lives.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2018:</strong> How many of us come back from a lunch break with the best of intentions for an industrious end to the day, only to suffer the dreaded post-lunch slump? Pink lays out the scientific case for this phenomena, a peak, trough, and then recovery of energy levels and productivity seen in people worldwide, across all cultures and geographies. By being aware of one&#x2019;s own chronotype, i.e. when they tend to experience peak and diminished performance, (for the record, I&#x2019;m writing this review right before lunch), Pink argues readers can be more effective in choosing when to tackle a new project at work, when to give a big presentation, or even when to schedule a surgery. <em>--Matt Fyffe</em><b>Daniel H.

Sebastian St. Cyr, an unconventional nobleman with a talent for detection, is called in by Westminster chief magistrate Sir Henry Lovejoy after two scions of the upper classes are found butchered and left on public display. St. Cyr soon finds a connection between the killer's calling card and a John Donne poem. As shadowy figures threaten and the parents of the victims display an inappropriate hostility to his efforts, the sleuth doggedly persists, uncovering a secret with shocking repercussions for London's upper class. Neatly meshing the page-turning whodunit plot with major developments in St. Cyr's love life, Harris shows every indication of assuming the mantle of the late Bruce Alexander as a reliable producer of quality period mysteries. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That meant I did a limited amount of work in a Homicide unit at the Miami P.D. and taught a class in criminal justice at a community college way up on N.W. 27th Avenue, not far from a place called Opa-Locka. </p><p> Opa-Locka was a gigantic pink stucco-and-plaster nightmare designed to look like a complex of Arabian mosques. In the early a.m., fog from either the ocean or the Glades, mixed with dust and carbon monoxide, clung like strips of dirty cotton to the decrepit minarets and cracked walls of the buildings. At night the streets were lit by vapor lamps that glowed inside the fog with the dirty iridescence that you associate with security lighting in prison compounds. The palms on the avenues were blighted by disease, the fronds clacking dryly in the fouled air. The yards in the neighborhoods contained more gray sand than grass. Homes that could contain little of value were protected by bars on the windows and razor wire on the fences. Lowrider gangbangers, the broken mufflers of their gas-guzzlers throbbing against the asphalt, smashed liquor bottles on the sidewalks and no one said a word. </p><p> For me, it was a place where I didn't have to make comparisons and where each dawn took on the watery hue of a tequila sunrise. If I found myself at first light in Opa-Locka, my choices were usually uncomplicated: I either continued drinking or entered an altered state known as delirium tremens. </p><p> Four or five nights a week I deconstructed myself in a bar where people had neither histories nor common geographic origins. Their friendships with one another began and ended at the front door. Most of them drank with a self-deprecating resignation and long ago had given up rationalizing the lives they led, I suspect allowing themselves a certain degree of peace. I never saw any indication they either knew or cared that I was a police officer. In fact, as I write these words today, I'm sure they recognized me as one of their own -- a man who of his own volition had consigned himself to Dante's ninth circle, his hand clasped confidently around a mug of draft with a submerged jigger of whiskey coiling up from the bottom. </p><p> But there was one visitor to the bar whom I did call friend. His name was Dallas Klein, a kid who in late '71 had flown a slick through a blistering curtain of RPG and automatic weapons fire to pick up a bunch of stranded LURPs on the Cambodian border. He brought home two Purple Hearts, a Silver Star, and a nervous tic in his face that made you think a bee was buzzing around his left eye. </p><p> Like me, he loved Gulf Stream Race Track and the jai alai fronton up the road in Broward County. He also loved the craps table at a private club in Hollywood, a floating poker game in Little Havana, the dogs at Flagler, the trotters at Pompano, the Florida Derby at Hialeah, the rows of gleaming slot machines clanging with a downpour of coins on a cruise to Jamaica. </p><p> But he was a good kid, not a drunk, not mean-spirited or resentful yet about the addiction that had already cost him a fianc�e and a two-bedroom stucco house on a canal in Fort Lauderdale. He grinned at his losses, his eyes wrinkling at the corners, as though a humorous acknowledgment of his problem made it less than it was. On Saturdays he ate an early lunch of a hamburger and glass of milk at the bar while he studied the <i>Morning Telegraph</i>, his ink-black hair cut short, his face always good-natured. By one o'clock he and I would be out at the track together, convinced that we knew the future, the drone of the crowd mysteriously erasing any fears of mortality we may have possessed. </p><p> On a sunny weekday afternoon, when the jacaranda trees and bougainvillea were in bloom, Dallas strolled into the bar whistling a tune. He'd picked three NFL winners that week and today he'd hit a perfecta and a quinella at Hialeah. He bought a round of well drinks for the house and had dinners of T-bones and Irish potatoes brought in for him and me. </p><p> Then two men of a kind you never want to meet came through the front door, the taller one beckoning to the bartender, the shorter man scanning the tables, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness of the bar's interior. </p><p> "Got to dee-dee, Dave. Call me," Dallas said, dropping his fork and steak knife in his plate, pulling his leather jacket off the back of his chair. </p><p> He was out the back door like a shot. </p><p> He made it as far as a lavender Cadillac where a man as big as the sky waited for him, his arms folded on his chest, his wraparound mirror shades swimming with distorted images of minarets and broken glass sprinkled along the top of a stucco wall. </p><p> The two men who had come in through the front of the bar followed Dallas outside. I hesitated, then wiped my mouth with my napkin and went outside, too. </p><p> The parking area had been created out of crushed building material that was spiked with weeds. The wind was blowing hard, and the royal palms out on the boulevard thrashed and twisted against a perfect blue sky. The three men whom I did not know had formed a circle around Dallas as though each of them had a fixed role he had played many times before. </p><p> The driver of the Caddy had the biggest neck I had ever seen on a human being. It was as wide as his jowls, his tie and collar pin like formal dress on a pig. He chewed gum and gazed at the palm trees whipping against the sky, as though he were disengaged from the conversation. The man who had spoken to the bartender was the talker. He wore polyester sports clothes and white loafers and looked like a consumptive, his hair as white as meringue, his shoulders stooped with bone loss, his face netted with the lines of a chain-smoker. </p><p> "Whitey is supposed to carry you for sixteen large?" he said. "That ain't his money. He's paying a point and a half vig a week on that. No, Dallas, you don't talk, you listen. Everybody appreciates what you did for your country, but when you owe sixteen large, that war hero shit don't slide down the pipe." </p><p> But the man who caught my eye was the short one. He seemed wrapped too tight for his own body, the same way a meth addict seems to boil in his own juices. His mouth was like a horizontal keyhole, the corner of his upper lip exposing his teeth, as though he were starting to grin. He listened intently to every word in the conversation, waiting for the green light to flash, his eyes flickering with anticipation. </p><p> The consumptive man rested his palm on Dallas's shoulder. "What? You think we're being hard on you? You want Ernesto to drive us out in the Glades so we can talk there? Whitey likes you, kid. You got no idea how much he likes you, how kind you're being treated here." </p><p> "You gentlemen have a problem with my friend Dallas?" I asked. </p><p> In the quiet I could hear the palm fronds rattling above the stucco wall, a gust of wind tumbling a piece of newspaper past a spiked iron gate. </p><p> "No, we don't got a problem," the short man said, turning toward me, the sole of one shoe grinding on a piece of broken mortar. His hair was peroxided, feathered on the back of his neck. He wore platform shoes and a dark blue suit that was cut so the flaps stuck out from his waist, and a silver shirt dancing with light, and a silk kerchief tied around his throat. His eyes contained a cool green fire whose source a cautious man doesn't probe. </p><p> "Dallas has a phone call," I said. </p><p> "Take a message," the short man said. </p><p> "It's his mother. She really gets mad when Dallas doesn't come to the phone," I said. </p><p> "He's a cop," the driver of the Caddy said, removing his shades, pinching the glare out of his eyes. </p><p> The short man and the man in polyester sports clothes took my inventory. "You a cop?" the short man said, smiling for the first time. </p><p> "You never can tell," I replied. </p><p> "Nice place to hang out," he said. </p><p> "You bet. If you want a tab, I'll talk to the bartender," I said. </p><p> The short man laughed and accepted a stick of gum from the driver. Then he stepped close to Dallas and spoke to him in a whisper, one that caused the blood to drain out of Dallas's face. </p><p> After the three men had gotten back into their Caddy and driven away, I asked Dallas what the short man had said. </p><p> "Nothing. He's a jerk. Forget it," he said. </p><p> "Who's Whitey?" </p><p> "Whitey Bruxal. He runs a book out of a pizza joint in Hallendale." </p><p> "You're into him for sixteen grand?" </p><p> "I got a handle on it. It's not a problem." </p><p> Inside the bar, he pushed aside his food and ordered a Scotch with milk. After three more of the same, the color came back into his cheeks. He blew out his breath and rested his forehead on the heel of his hand. </p><p> "Wow," he said quietly, more to himself than to me. </p><p> "What did that dude say to you?" I asked. </p><p> "One-one-five Coconut Palm Drive." </p><p> "I don't follow," I said. </p><p> "I have a six-year-old daughter. She lives with her grandmother in the Grove. That's her address," he replied. He stared at me blankly, as though he could not assimilate his own words. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Dallas invited me to his apartment the next evening and cooked hamburgers for us on a hibachi out on a small balcony. Down below were blocks and blocks of one-story houses with gravel-and-tar roofs and yards in which the surfaces of plastic-sided swimming pools wrinkled in the wind. The sun looked broken and red on the horizon, without heat, veiled with smoke from a smoldering fire in the Glades. Dallas showed me pictures of his daughter taken in Orlando and in front of a Ferris wheel at Coney Island. One picture showed her in a snowsuit sewn with rabbit ears that flopped down from the hood. The little girl's hair was gold, her eyes blue, her smile magical. </p><p> "What happened to her mom?" I said. </p><p> "She took off with a guy who was running coke from the Islands in a cigarette boat. They hit a buoy at fifty knots south of Pine Key. Get this. The guy flew a Cobra in 'Nam....</p></p><h2>Jesse: The man who outran Hitler</h2><p>The man who outran Hitler</p><p>A remarkable self-portrait of the black man who carried this country to greatness in the 1936 Olympics.

His family - my great-grandmother was Will's sister - had left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid 1820s. A truly capable and resourceful man, Will had worked hard in difficult conditions, farming the land, raising a family and helping others around him to survive the effects of the Boer Wars. He was garrulous and charismatic, a twinkle in his eye, passionate about big game hunting, and from time to time could afford a ticket to Kenya on one of the early steamships to satiate his&nbsp;lust for the land and the animals. The great profusion of wildlife, the rolling grass plains - the storehouse of life itself - Kenya was where his heart seemed to soar, where he was transformed from the inside out.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was during one of these hunting expeditions, in the spring of 1907, that Will befriended Sir Charles Eliot, Governor of the fledgling British colony of Kenya. The two men were drawn to each other: Will, a true pioneer, was the sort of man who made things happen, and Eliot, a true politician, was the sort of man who made other men offers to make things happen. Out in the bush one morning, Eliot put an intriguing proposition to my great-uncle: if he could bring in twenty families to Kenya, then the Government would allocate them free land on which to settle. Just that week, Eliot had received an order from the authorities back home to speed up the colony's development, to get on with expanding the single track beyond Nairobi and to get white settlers in to increase trade and the resources for the railway. The British Government had so far forked out around �5 million and they wanted to see some return, sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The reason for Britain's involvement in East Africa was not actually Kenya itself - it was Uganda and the source of the Nile. The Government wanted to prevent the Germans or French jeopardizing access to the Suez Canal, as this was the British trade route to India, the jewel in the Imperial crown. Building the railway was a massive undertaking, and thousands of Sikh labourers from British India were shipped in to undertake its construction. The railway snaked its way through the diverse habitats of Kenya from the port town of Mombasa - through dense inhospitable scrubland leading on to open grassland plains, once the native Masai's best grazing land. Once the dominant tribe, their numbers had been depleted by smallpox during the late 1900s.</p> <p>Great-Uncle Will was so smitten with the Kenyan bush, so captivated by the idea of actually living in this astonishing country,&nbsp;that he cut short his trip to return home, determined to recruit the families that Eliot required. He didn't need to look too far, as this branch of my family was full of prolific breeders. He himself had spawned seventeen children from his three wives, and they in turn had produced many others. Excited and alive to this opportunity, he did a good job persuading some of his immediate family to agree. Then he turned to his sister - my Great-Granny Aggett. She and her husband - and their not inconsiderable brood of eight children - were perfect targets. Things had not been going too well for Great-Grandpa Aggett. Having acquired a taste for alcohol and gambling, in cahoots with&nbsp;none other than the local bank manager, who saw to it that his mounting overdraft was conveniently overlooked, he was up to his eyes in debt. The family's precious old homestead and once prosperous farm in the Eastern Cape had been sold off and he was much chastened by the consequence of his addictions. Despite approaching sixty, he was keen to be rid of his tarnished reputation, to begin a new life. Will was offering him that&nbsp;lifeline and he rather gratefully signed up.</p> <p>The Aggetts' eldest daughter, Ellen Margaret, had been widowed early on in her marriage. Left with two young sons, Stanley and Bryan, she had returned to live with my great-grandparents. Ellen was a feisty young woman, known for her fortitude and resourcefulness, and was more than willing to taste adventure. As it turns out, this decision was to have a direct effect on me: Ellen was my grandmother, and her seven-year-old son Bryan would eventually become my father.</p> <p>Will was a marvellous storyteller, and his golden words conjured up the magnificence of Kenya, breathing life into his images of the land, the people and the wildlife. Quite simply, he saw Kenya as another Eden, the prospect of living there an invitation to paradise. In just a few months his powers of persuasion were enough to convince twenty families to want to up sticks from the Eastern Cape, to trek through the uncharted interior of&nbsp;Eastern Africa and begin life over. These were people descended from solid pioneering stock - stoical, adventurous, enamoured of Africa - the ability to uproot, survive and build new lives in their blood. They had listened to their parents' epic stories of crossing new lands and were somewhere hardwired to feel the desire to experience the challenges for themselves. I would love to be able to listen back down the years to what was discussed at Will's legendary planning meetings. To us, in these days of sophisticated travel when we can get almost anything we need anywhere in the world, an unimaginable amount of planning and thought had to go into the journey. Although the landing post in Mombasa was still the ancient coastal hub it had always been, and inland the railway had reached Nairobi, the travellers had to be self-supporting in every respect. There would be nothing to help them on the way - no roads, no shops, no doctors, dentists or chemists. They would be entirely responsible for keeping themselves, their babies, their children and their livestock alive and well.</p> <p>It wasn't just a matter of a few provisions. When - and if&nbsp; - they arrived at the allocated spots, they would need a nucleus of breeding stock, as well as farm implements, seeds, tools, furniture&nbsp;and, most importantly, guns and ammunition to protect themselves and their property. The women had to decide on the bare essentials in the way of cooking pots, blankets, bedlinen, materials, haberdashery, medicine, clothes and toiletries. Of untold preciousness was the legacy of their settler ancestors -&nbsp;densely handwritten notes of practical hints on self-sufficiency, detailing how to make soap and candles; how to preserve and bottle foodstuffs;&nbsp;how to make clothes; how to educate your children on the go; how to use herbs, berries and wild plants to&nbsp;prevent and cure illness; and how to address emotional wobbles and the inevitable mood swings. Women back then were superb cooks, skilled seamstresses, tough and hardened to the perils of settler life, but for these families, the arduous nature of the journey and the harsh reality of starting life up all over again presented new challenges.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eventually the day dawned when all the preparations were complete. There was no turning back. Lying in Port Elizabeth harbour, on the eastern seaboard of South Africa, was the chartered German ship the Adolf Woermann, waiting to receive the families and all their possessions. And what possessions there were! Once loaded, the great ship must have looked - and sounded - like the proverbial Noah's Ark. It conjures a vivid image in my mind, picturing my grandmother and her tiny children on board engulfed by animals of wildly varying sizes: prime stock, work oxen, riding horses, milk and beef cattle, sheep, milking goats, poultry, ducks, geese and turkeys, domestic pets of every sort, as well as huge wagons, farm implements of every description, precious pieces of antique furniture, boxes of books, bottles, jars and sewing machines. There was no concept of travelling light back then!&nbsp;</p> <p>My children and grandchildren are so rooted here now, so settled, so much part of this land, that it touches me deeply to imagine the sheer emotion of the moment when the boat slowly drew away from the docks, with every single member on board waving a tearful farewell to all their loved ones on shore. None of them knew what the future held for them in a new land, and they must all have been conscious that there would be great dangers in the years that lay ahead. And they also knew that for the older members of the family this separation would be final, for they would be unlikely to set foot on their home soil again. It must have taken great courage, particularly on the part of the women, to launch themselves and their children on such a gamble into the unknown.</p> <p>The Adolf Woermann sailed for two long months. The journey was not without its difficulties - dreadfully cramped conditions, illness and the inevitable death of livestock. But coming into the picturesque harbour of Mombasa against the backdrop of a splendid tropical sunrise must have been like the arrival in a promised land. As the adults transferred the contents of the ship to the docks, the children ran around in delight despite the punishing humidity and heat. Mombasa was a vibrant, noisy place, bright with the colourful goods of Arabic and Indian traders, the smells of spices, perfumes and exotic foods. The streets were lined with white frangipani blossom and coconut palms, and while the sun was setting there was time to stop and enjoy a meal in the old part of the town.</p> <p>Before the journey inland could begin, all the livestock had to be swaddled in a protective hessian covering, leaving just a small opening for the eyes and nose, since they would be journeying across the notorious tsetse-infested nyika. This formidable and inhospitable barrier of arid scrub country was known as the Taru Desert, described in the 1870s by the Scottish explorer Joseph Thomson as 'weird and ghastly...eerie and full of sadness, as if here is all death and desolation'. Just one bite from an infected fly could be catastrophic, transmitting the wasting livestock disease trypanosomiasis, for which there was at that time no known cure. A few years earlier, most of the livestock used to transport materials to build the railway had been wiped out in this way and lessons had been learned. It must have taken days to cut the cloth and secure it around each animal. Not an enviable job.</p> <p>Once the cattle were ready and the train loaded with myriad possessions, the next stage of the journey could begin. However, even the preparations necessary for a train to depart from a stop were complicated, for in those early days the wood-burning steam locomotives depended on a plentiful supply of both wood and water. There was no piped water in Mombasa, so supplies had to be drawn from two eighty-foot wells, or pumped from a river four miles away. Getting the train going was a big event. As a child listening to my father tell my brother, sisters and me the story of how our family came to be living in Kenya, I particularly loved the story-of-the-journey as it came to be known, and to this day I can shut my eyes and transport myself on board, catching the buzz of anticipation as the train drew out of Mombasa. There must have been a little shiver of apprehension running through some of the mothers in the group: the track had only recently been constructed, and although they were disembarking halfway along the route at Nairobi, they no doubt worried about some of the more shaky wooden trestle bridges and the deep ravines the train passed over. All the adults making the journey knew about the grisly deaths suffered by some fifty Indian and African construction workers in 1898 as they were building a bridge over the Tsavo River. It was this incident that had led to the lions in the area being dubbed the 'man-eaters of Tsavo', no doubt stirring fear in some of the less hardy members of my family.</p> <p>While my experiences of life in Kenya are different in so many respects to those of my ancestors, as they woke to their first morning aboard the train they saw the same dawn unfolding in glorious brilliance, the sky washed with varying shades of crimson, pink, rust and gold, that I do to this day. Their tired eyes, rimmed with the red dust of the nyika, also gazed, as mine have, spellbound across the broad expanse of the great rolling Athi plains. From the windows, they could see before them the bounty of Nature - oceans of wildebeest, zebra, antelope, gazelles,&nbsp;giraffe, great herds of buffalo and even rhinos. The children were electrified by the transformation of the landscape, and&nbsp;the journey opened their eyes to sights they had never seen before. A pride of lions beside the track, lolling replete and lazy beneath a lone tree on the plain, prompted the driver to halt the train in order to allow the passengers a longer look.&nbsp;In fact most of the time Great-Uncle Will and others journeyed on a special platform on the prow of the locomotive so that they could see the passing game herds more clearly. Inveterate hunter that he was, Great-Uncle Will on numerous occasions actually stopped the train to embark on a full-blown hunt, when a particularly good trophy had been spotted near the track. The train would merely wait for the hunters to return, and the other passengers did not object to the delay, happy to take part in the fun as spectators.</p> <p>How lightly my ancestors shot at animals. For us, now living in a different era, conscious of the decimation of wildlife and privileged even to glimpse such creatures in a wild situation, the actions of my forefathers appear shocking and difficult to understand. But at that time the maps of Kenya showed little on their empty faces, and beyond each horizon stretched another and another of endless untouched acres, sunlit plains of corn-gold grass, wooded luggas, lush valleys, crystal-clear waters. And everywhere there was wildlife in such spellbinding profusion that it is difficult for those who were never witness to this to even begin to visualize such numbers. At the time no one ever imagined that any amount of shooting could devastate the stocks of wild game, let alone all but eliminate it.</p> <p>Once the train reached Nairobi, the passengers had to disembark, see to some administrative formalities and make their final preparations for the great inland trek. Nairobi, originally a pastoral area inhabited by the Masai, had been founded in 1899 as a supply depot for the Uganda Railway, becoming the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate a few years later. In 1907 Nairobi was in the process of being rebuilt, having been decimated by a recent outbreak of the plague. When my family arrived, it was still a jumble of sheds, shacks and Indian dukas cut by one tree-lined cart-track known as Government Road. Most structures were raised up on stilts to keep inhabitants from sinking into the surrounding swamps. There was dust everywhere - it coated every visible surface and tree. But it was busy and vibrant, teeming with Indian railway workers, street vendors, rickshaws and mule buggies, and the family were entranced. The elders of the group rested overnight in the one hotel - the Norfolk - which overlooked a swamp where the wild creatures of the plains came to drink in their teeming numbers. It was a perfect place for Great-Uncle Will. Never one to pass up an opportunity, on the first night he left a drink on the Norfolk verandah to dash out and bag a good trophy spotted at the swamp, and on another night he did not even have to leave his drink, but managed to secure a trophy from the verandah itself.</p> <p>Soon enough, though, once the ox-wagons were loaded and ready, the family was ready for the trek inland. Dressed in their heavy...</p></p><h2>The Letter to the Romans (The Daily Study Bible Series)</h2><p>Dr. Barclay&#39;s fresh translation and clear exposition make Paul&#39;s very complicated letter to the church in Rome easier than ever to understand.

Into that unsteady atmosphere, which would soon enough erupt into another conflict with Britain in 1812, Dolley Madison arrived, alongside her husband, James. Within a few years, she had mastered both the social and political intricacies of the city, and by her death in 1849 was the most celebrated person in Washington. And yet, to most Americans, she's best known for saving a portrait from the burning White House, or as the namesake for a line of ice cream. <br>Why did her contemporaries give so much adulation to a lady so little known today? In <i>A Perfect Union</i>, Catherine Allgor reveals that while Dolley's gender prevented her from openly playing politics, those very constraints of womanhood allowed her to construct an American democratic ruling style, and to achieve her husband's political goals. And the way that she did so--by emphasizing cooperation over coercion, building bridges instead of bunkers--has left us with not only an important story about our past but a model for a modern form of politics. <br><br>Introducing a major new American historian, <i>A Perfect Union</i> is both an illuminating portrait of an unsung founder of our democracy, and a vivid account of a little-explored time in our history.<br><br></p><p>"Where is Dolley Madison when we need her?

What are the links between global militarism and the destruction of nature? In exploring such questions, the authors criticize prevailing theories and develop an intellectually rigorous ecofeminist perspective rooted in the needs of everyday life. They argue for the acceptance of limits, the rejection of the commoditization of needs, and a commitment to a new ethics.<br></p><p>Maria Mies is a Marxist feminist scholar who is renowned for her theory of capitalist patriarchy, which recognizes third world women and difference. She is a professor of sociology at Cologne University of Applied Sciences, but retired from teaching in 1993. Since the late 1960s she has been involved with feminist activism. In 1979, at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague, she founded the Women and Development programme. Her other titles published by Zed Books include The Lace Makers of Narsapur (1982), Women: The Last Colony (1988), The Subsistence Perspective (1999) and Ecofeminism (2014).&#39;Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva, a German social scientist from the feminist movement and an Indian physicist from the ecology movement, are ideally suited to author a book of such broad intellectual, geographic, and political scope. while there are some notable differences in their approaches, they are crystal clear their adversaries as patriarchal capitalism, which they hold responsible for the colonization of developing countries, women, and nature.&#39; Karen T Litfin, University of Washington &#39;Read independently of the collection, many of the essays have innovative things to say to the political movements involved in fighting large scale development, nuclear energy, violence against women, wars and environmental destruction. Shiva&#39;s discussion of the development establishment&#39;s misnomer of poverty, her discussion of the biotechnology and the impact of GATT on third world women and informative political critique, and Mies on eco-tourism, German women&#39;s response to Chernobyl, and her critique of body as property and self-determination in the context of surrogacy, are enlivening additions to important debates.&#39; Wendy Harcourt, Development Journal &#39;In view of the post-modern fashion for dismantling all generalizations, the views propounded in Mies&#39; and Shiva&#39;s Ecofeminism make refreshing reading. They show a commendable readiness to confront hypocrisy, challenge the intellectual heritage of the European Enlightenment, and breathe spiritual concerns into debates on gender and the environment. Technology development could benefit from their plea that progress through the control of nature must be replaced by cooperation, mutual care, and love.&#39; Emma Crewe, Appropriate Technology Journal &#39;Vandana Shiva and Maria Mies offer an all-embracing vision. They show the interconnectedness of these problems and trace them to their source: how our modern world has been relating to Nature since the time of the Enlightenment right up to the biotechnology of today; how superiority to and dominance over Nature has ensured the violence inseparable from our civilisation. [...] For all those, and certainly for humanists, who are wrestling with the ethical, sexist and racist issues raised by invasive reproductive gene technology, Maria Mies&#39; chapters on these developments are a must: she subjects them to the most thorough and thoughtful investigation based on what I see as sound humanist as well as feminist philosophy.&#39; Gwen Marsh, New Humanist &#39;Dual authorship at its best, these complementary perspectives of an Indian physical scientist and a German social scientist combine to bring feminist scruples to bear on the environment, new reproductive technologies and masculinist thinking.&#39; WATERwheeel &#39;[Ecofeminism] presents a very focused, searing indictment of development strategies practiced by the North on the South.&#39; Anne Stratham, Feminist Collections</p><h2>America&#39;s War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History</h2><p><b>LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD �&nbsp;<b>A searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades from retired army colonel and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Andrew J. Bacevich</b><br></b><br> From the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else. What caused this shift? Andrew J. Bacevich, one of the country&#x2019;s most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterprise&#x2014;now more than thirty years old and with no end in sight.<br><br> During the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United States initiated a new conflict&#x2014;a War for the Greater Middle East&#x2014;that continues to the present day. The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like &#x201c;permanent war&#x201d; and &#x201c;open-ended war&#x201d; have become part of everyday discourse.<br><br> Connecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what America&#x2019;s costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does. <br><br> A twenty-year army veteran who served in Vietnam, Andrew J. Bacevich brings the full weight of his expertise to this vitally important subject. <i>America&#x2019;s War for the Greater Middle East</i> is a bracing after-action report from the front lines of history.

In that sense, just as the American Revolution was about independence and the Civil War was about slavery, oil has always defined the raison d&#x2019;�tre of the War for the Greater Middle East. Over time, other considerations intruded and complicated the war&#x2019;s conduct, but oil as a prerequisite of freedom was from day one an abiding consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a young man I required no instruction in that relationship, whose sweetness I had tasted at first hand. In June 1969, a newly commissioned shavetail fresh out of West Point, I was home on leave courting the girl who was to become my wife. She lived on Chicago&#x2019;s South Side. My mother lived in northwest Indiana.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every evening I drove my brand--new Mustang Mach I&#x2014;-candy--apple red with black piping&#x2014;-into Chicago to see my beloved and then in the early morning hours returned home. Before each trip, I stopped at a service station to top off. Ten gallons at 29.9 cents per gallon usually sufficed. The three bucks weren&#x2019;t trivial&#x2014;-a second lieutenant&#x2019;s pay came to $343 per month before taxes (more importantly, before the monthly car payment)&#x2014;-but the expense took a backseat to romance. I do not recall wondering where the gas came from&#x2014;-Texas? California?&#x2014;-nor about how much more there was. Like most Americans, I took it for granted that the supply was inexhaustible. All I knew for sure was that with four years of West Point behind me and Vietnam just ahead, life behind the wheel of a pony car in the summer of 1969 was pretty good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is easy to disparage this version of freedom, as postwar social critics from C. Wright Mills and David Riesman to William Whyte and Vance Packard had already done and others would do. For the ostensibly alienated and apathetic citizens of postwar America, trapped in a soul--deadening &#x201c;new universe of management and manipulation,&#x201d; as Mills put it, freedom had become little more than &#x201c;synthetic excitement.&#x201d;1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe so. Yet whatever the merit of that critique, it never made much of a dent in the average American&#x2019;s aspirations. The American way of life may have been shallow and materialistic, its foundation a bland conformity. But even for people of modest means, the exercise of American--style freedom did not lack for pleasures and satisfactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with the smell of a new car, those pleasures tended to be transitory. But an unspoken premise underlying that way of life was that there was more still to come, Americans preferring to measure freedom quantitatively. More implied bigger and better. Yet few of those driving (or coveting) the latest made--in--Detroit gas--guzzler appreciated just how precarious such expectations might be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I sped off to Chicago each evening, with radio and AC blasting, the gasoline in my tank was increasingly likely to come from somewhere other than a stateside oilfield. In 1969, imports already accounted for 20 percent of the 15 million barrels that Americans consumed daily. The very next year U.S. domestic oil production peaked at nearly 12 million barrels per day, thereafter beginning a decline that continued through the remainder of the century and appeared irreversible. The proportion of oil coming from abroad increased accordingly. Within a decade, imports of foreign oil had reached 8 million barrels per day.2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By 1973, even I was obliged to take notice. That fall, in retaliation for the U.S. supporting Israel in the October War, Arabs suspended oil exports to the United States and the West. The impact of the embargo was immediate and severe. The resulting oil shortage all but paralyzed the U.S. economy and produced widespread alarm among Americans suddenly deprived of the mobility that they now considered their birthright. Oil had become a weapon, wielded by foreigners intent on harming Americans. Here, it seemed, coming out of nowhere, was a direct existential threat to the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the crisis inducing another eyeball--to--eyeball confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger announced that U.S. forces were on alert, pending their possible deployment to the Middle East. At the time, I was a captain, stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, alongside El Paso and just across from Mexico. The regiment in which I served had war plans to deploy to West Germany to participate in NATO&#x2019;s defense of Western Europe. If required, we probably could have occupied Juarez. But we had no plans to fight in the Persian Gulf, whether to thwart a threatened Soviet intervention there or to seize Arab oil fields.3 The very notion seemed preposterous. At the time it was. Not for long, however.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, no such deployment occurred, the immediate emergency passed, and oil imports from the Persian Gulf eventually resumed. Yet the availability and price of gasoline had now become and thereafter remained a matter of national concern. Even as Americans were learning to live with nuclear weapons&#x2014;-the prospect of a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union now appearing more theoretical than real&#x2014;-they were also learning that they could not live without oil. Ever so subtly, the hierarchy of national security priorities was beginning to shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an immediate response to the crisis, the Nixon administration hastily cobbled together a plan that promised, in the president&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;to insure that by the end of this decade, Americans will not have to rely on any source of energy beyond our own.&#x201d; Project Independence, Nixon called it. The immediate emphasis was on conservation. Details of what the government intended beyond urging Americans to save were vague, Nixon simply vowing that &#x201c;we will once again have plentiful supplies of energy,&#x201d; with the energy crisis &#x201c;resolved not only for our time but for all time.&#x201d;4</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This did not occur, of course, but Nixon&#x2019;s vision persisted. The nation&#x2019;s political agenda now incorporated the goal of energy independence as one of those &#x201c;must--do&#x201d; items that somehow never get done, like simplifying the tax code or reducing cost overruns on Pentagon weapons programs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea persisted because it had broad popular appeal. Yet in some quarters, the larger policy implications of pursuing energy independence did not sit well. The very effort implied retrenchment or giving in. This was not the way the world was supposed to work in the latter half of the twentieth century. Rather than the United States accom-modating others&#x2014;-in this case, the newly empowered Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with its largely Arab membership&#x2014;-others were expected to accommodate the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an outgrowth of this dissatisfaction, the notion that American military muscle might provide a suitable corrective began to insinuate itself into the policy debate. Writing in the January 1975 issue of <i>Commentary,</i> for example, the noted political scientist Robert W. Tucker bemoaned Washington&#x2019;s apparent unwillingness even to consider the possibility of armed intervention in the Arab world. &#x201c;If the present situation goes on unaltered,&#x201d; Tucker warned, &#x201c;a disaster resembling the 1930s&#x201d; beckoned. To &#x201c;insist that before using force one must exhaust all other remedies, when the exhaustion of all other remedies is little more than the functional equivalent of accepting chaos&#x201d; was therefore the height of folly. When it came to something as important as oil, the putative lessons of the recently concluded Vietnam War simply didn&#x2019;t apply. Tucker wanted policymakers to get serious about the possibility of using force in the Middle East.5</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two months later, in <i>Harper&#x2019;s,</i> the pseudonymous but apparently well--connected Miles Ignotus went a step further, outlining in detail a plan to seize Saudi oil fields outright. Four divisions plus an air force contingent, with Israel generously pitching in to help, would do the trick, he argued. Echoing Tucker, Ignotus categorized spineless American leaders alongside &#x201c;the craven men of Munich.&#x201d; Allowing OPEC to dictate the price of oil amounted to &#x201c;a futile policy of appeasement&#x201d; and would inevitably lead to further disasters.6 In contrast, forceful military action promised an easy and nearly risk--free solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ignotus was actually Edward Luttwak, well--known national security gadfly and Pentagon consultant. In positing a U.S. attack on Saudi oil fields, he was pursuing an agenda that looked far beyond mere energy security. Luttwak was part of group seeking to &#x201c;revolutionize warfare.&#x201d; Saudi Arabia, he and his like-minded colleagues believed, offered the prospect of demonstrating the feasibility of using &#x201c;fast, light forces to penetrate the enemy&#x2019;s vital centers,&#x201d; thereby providing a shortcut to victory. This was an early version of what twenty years later became known as the Revolution in Military Affairs. The invasion of Iraq in 2003, Luttwak would later claim, signified &#x201c;the accomplishment of that revolution.&#x201d;7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Along with a strikingly strident tone, a strong sense of entitlement pervaded both essays. That Americans might submit to &#x201c;the political blackmail of the kings and dictators of Araby,&#x201d; Ignotus wrote, in order to ensure access to &#x201c;a product [Arabs] had neither made nor found&#x201d; represented an affront. Sure, the vast petroleum reserves were located on &#x201c;their&#x201d; territory. But for Tucker and Ignotus, that fact qualified as incidental at best. Middle East oil properly belonged to those who had discovered, developed, and actually needed it. By all rights, therefore, it was &#x201c;ours,&#x201d; a perspective that resonated with many ordinary Americans. All that was required to affirm those rights was the vigorous use of U.S. military power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notably absent from this analysis, however, was any appreciation for context. Tucker and Ignotus alike showed no interest in the recent history of the Middle East. They ignored the dubious legacy of previous Western interventionism, especially by Great Britain, until recently the region&#x2019;s imperial overlord. That the United States was willy--nilly supplanting the British as the dominant power in the Arab world and more broadly in the Greater Middle East ought to have given Americans pause. After all, the lessons to be taken from the British experience were almost entirely cautionary ones. That was not a baton that the Americans were grasping but a can of worms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More astonishingly still, neither Tucker nor Ignotus showed any interest in religion or its political implications. Theirs was a thoroughly secular perspective. Islam, therefore, simply went unmentioned. Once having asserted direct control over Arab oil, Tucker and Ignotus took it for granted that U.S. troops would remain for years to come. Yet they were oblivious to the possibility that a protracted military occupation might encounter unforeseen snags, whether by violating local sensitivities or enmeshing the United States in ancient sectarian or ethnic disputes. In contemplating action, the United States routinely took into account the potential response of powerful adversaries like the Soviet Union. More often than not, it factored in the concerns of valued allies like West Germany or Japan. That a lesser country like Iran or Iraq or Saudi Arabia could obstruct or stymie a superpower was not a proposition that many Americans at this juncture were prepared to entertain. The policy prescriptions offered by Tucker and Ignotus reflected this view&#x2014;-even if the North Vietnamese had only recently exposed it as false.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first round of proposals to militarize U.S. policy in the Middle East found little favor in the Pentagon. Ever since World War II, apart from the brief intervention in Lebanon that Dwight D. Eisenhower had ordered back in 1958&#x2014;-a virtually bloodless comma inserted between Korea and Vietnam&#x2014;-America&#x2019;s military had by and large steered clear of the region, leaving it in the hands of diplomats and spooks.8</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in the early 1970s, U.S. forces had their hands full with other concerns. The just--concluded American war in Vietnam had left the armed services, especially the U.S. Army, battered in body and spirit. Recovering from that unhappy ordeal was the order of the day. This meant re--equipping and adjusting to the end of the draft, priorities addressed with the Soviet threat very much in mind. The prospect of intervening in the Persian Gulf figured as exceedingly improbable. The idea of sending U.S. forces elsewhere in the wider Islamic world, to Afghanistan, say, or Somalia, appeared absurd.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So when Secretary of Defense Elliott Richardson released his annual report to Congress in April 1973, he evinced little interest in the Middle East and only perfunctory concern about energy security. The 126--page document devoted exactly one anodyne paragraph to each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the first, Richardson expressed his hope for an end to &#x201c;the potentially explosive Arab--Israeli conflict.&#x201d; He cited U.S. arms sales and its &#x201c;limited military presence&#x201d; as intended &#x201c;to produce stability&#x201d; and to encourage negotiations. Yet Richardson also made it clear that the core problem wasn&#x2019;t Washington&#x2019;s to solve: &#x201c;Peace and stability will be possible only if all the parties involved develop a mutual interest in accommodation and restraint.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the second paragraph, while noting that the Persian Gulf contained &#x201c;approximately one--half of the world&#x2019;s proven oil reserves,&#x201d; Richardson emphasized that the United States would look &#x201c;primarily to the states in the area to maintain peace and stability.&#x201d;9 Pentagon priorities lay elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A year later, in the wake of the October War and with Americans still reeling from the first oil shock, Richardson&#x2019;s successor James R. Schlesinger made it clear that those priorities had not changed. The Pentagon remained fixated on the U.S.--Soviet competition. When the United States evaluated threats to national security, Schlesinger wrote, &#x201c;We do so primarily with the Soviet Union in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His 237--page report reflected that priority. Apart from a brief reference to the lessons of the most recent Arab--Israeli conflict, which merely &#x201c;confirmed prior judgments&#x201d; about war, Schlesinger ignored the Middle East altogether. Under the heading of &#x201c;planning contingencies,&#x201d; the defense secretary identified Europe, Northeast Asia, and (surprisingly) Southeast Asia as places where U.S. forces could potentially fight. The oil--rich lands touched by the waters of the Persian Gulf didn&#x2019;t make the cut.10</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The passing of a year brought yet another defense secretary but no real change in perspective. In November 1975 Donald Rumsfeld ascended to the post of Pentagon chief, which he held for only fourteen months, his tenure curtailed when Gerald Ford lost the 1976 presidential election. In January 1977, Rumsfeld&#x2019;s annual report, issued as eight years of Republican rule were coming to an end, claimed credit over the course of more than three hundred pa...</p></p><h2>Tough Times, Strong Women (ILLUSTRATED)</h2><p>Offers stories of everyday American women throughout the 20th century</p><p></p><h2>The Good Shepherd.</h2><p>This book is a facsimile reprint and may contain imperfections such as marks, notations, marginalia and flawed pages.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesCecil Scott &#34;C.S.&#34; Forester was the pen name of Cecil Louis Troughton Smith (27 August 1899 - 2 April 1966), an English novelist who rose to fame with tales of naval warfare.

It's the first of Bola�o's two giant masterpieces to be translated into English (the second, <i>2666</i>, is due out next year), and you can see how he's influenced an era. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p> <strong>Questions for Translator Natasha Wimmer</strong> </p><p> Natasha Wimmer translated books by Mario Vargas Llosa and Bola�o's good friend Rodrigo Fres�n, among others, before tackling Bola�o's two long novels, <i>The Savage Detectives</i> and the upcoming <i>2666</i>, which have had an immeasurable impact on modern Latin American fiction (and perhaps now on Anglo American writing as well). We asked her a few questions about the process of bringing such a vast and vital book into English. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How did you come to literary translation, and to translating a work of such prestige? Is the community of Spanish-to-English literary translators small, given Americans' famous lack of interest in translated work? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Luck, really. I lived in Spain when I was little, which is where I learned Spanish, and then I studied Spanish literature in college, but it was a job in publishing--at FSG, the publisher of <i>The Savage Detectives</i>--that made me realize that literary translation was something I could try. I&#x2019;ve been translating now for eight years. My first project was a novel by the Cuban writer Pedro Juan Guti�rrez, <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i>, and since then I&#x2019;ve worked on books by Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Zaid, Rodrigo Fres�n, and Laura Restrepo. When I read <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, I thought it was one of the best novels I had read in any language in years, but I was sure there was no chance I would get to translate it. Bola�o already had a great translator--Chris Andrews. But Andrews couldn't do it, and I was the extremely fortunate runner-up.</p><p> The community of full-time translators is definitely small--it's hard to make a living. But there are many great occasional translators--professors, editors, writers. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> We're told that Bola�o towers over his generation of writers (and I can believe it). What did he do that was new? What has his influence been? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Bola�o was (is) the first to make a true break from the legacy of the Boom. Many other writers of his generation, and younger writers, too, have tried and are still trying to make a literature of their own, one that doesn&#x2019;t languish in the long shadow of Garc�a M�rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and the other novelists who exploded on the world scene in the 1960s. Bola�o made the leap seem effortless. The writers of the Boom put Latin America on the map. Bola�o creates a Latin America of the mind, a post-nationalist Latin America filtered through a rootless, restless, uncompromising literary sensibility. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Could you describe Bola�o's style and his sentences? (I love his parentheses.) How did you handle the dozens of voices in <i>The Savage Detectives</i>? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> Bola�o is both a maximalist and a classicist. He loves to play with excess, with the notion of reckless abandon, but beneath that there is a very careful sense of balance. He was a poet for many years before he became a novelist, and he is an endlessly inventive stylist. But--more rarely for a poet--he also has an unerring sense of character and a palpable fondness for his characters. The Savage Detectives could never have worked otherwise. There are very few writers who could write a novel from the perspective of fifty-odd characters and make each character's story seem urgent and intimate.</p><p> From the translator's perspective, some voices were definitely more difficult than others, but I rarely felt that I had to strain to make them distinct from each other. Mostly, it just involved following Bola�o's cues. The hardest thing, oddly enough, was getting the rhythm of his sentences right. There is something syncopated and unpredictable about them that would have been all too easy to smooth over as a translator, and I made a concerted effort not to do that. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> All of his books are full of references to, and appearances by, Latin American writers both fictional and real and I'm sure as a clueless American reader I'm missing hundreds of inside jokes. What's it like to read his work when you actually know the people he's referring to? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> It adds a little something, but not as much as you might think. And many of his references are obscure even to Spanish-language readers. There is something cultish and purposefully arcane about the literary world that Bola�o's protagonist, Garc�a Madero, yearns to join, and like Garc�a Madero, the reader is entranced by authors' names and book titles without knowing exactly where they come from. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You are working on translating his other giant masterpiece, <i>2666</i>, the even larger novel that he completed just before his death. How is it going? What can we expect from <i>2666</i>? </p><p><strong>Wimmer:</strong> It's an extremely long novel (1100 pages in the Spanish edition ), so it's a test of stamina, but it's going very well. Like <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, it revolves around a lost writer (Ces�rea Tinajero in <i>TSD</i> and Benno von Archimboldi in <i>2666</i>), and the crucial episodes take place in the north of Mexico, but it is a darker book. The lurking sense of dread that many of the characters feel in <i>TSD</i> becomes something more palpable and sharply defined in <i>2666</i>, and is linked to the killings of women in the Mexican city of Santa Teresa (modeled on Ciudad Ju�rez) and the legacy of the wars of the 20th century, particularly World War II. </p><p><b>Roberto Bola�o</b> was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953. He grew up in Chile and Mexico City, where he was a founder of the Infrarealist poetry movement. His first full-length novel, <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, received the Herralde Prize and the R�mulo Gallegos Prize when it appeared in 1998. Roberto Bola�o died in Blanes, Spain, at the age of fifty. </p></p><h2>Tracking &amp; the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks &amp; Sign</h2><p>A comprehensive guide to animal tracking covers rodents, rabbits, weasels, racoons, foxes, wolves, coyotes, deer, sheep, elk, moose, and bears</p><p>A good observer of nature, walking, say, in an oak forest, may discern that some of the acorns on which he or she is treading are broken into little bits. After reading wildlife interpreter and photographer Paul Rezendes's guidebook to animal signs, that same observer will be able to tell which of those acorns have been split by human footsteps and deer hooves and which have been gnawed apart by squirrels--and by what species of squirrel. A wonderfully thorough, well-illustrated compendium, Rezendes's text covers a wide range of North American animal species, including rodents, hoofed animals, bears, raccoons, opossums, and members of the weasel, rabbit, dog, and cat families. He describes not only the signs these animals leave but also their ways of life throughout the year, and with an appropriately environmentalist purpose. "Ultimately," Rezendes writes, "tracking an animal makes us sensitive to it--a bond is formed, an intimacy develops. We begin to realize that what is happening to the animals and to the planet is actually happening to us." He's right, of course, but one need not take such a macrocosmic view of nature to take pleasure in, and learn from, this fine book. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Paul Rezendes</p><h2>An Elephant &amp; Piggie Book (I Love My New Toy!)</h2><p>An Elephant &amp; Piggie Book (I Love My New Toy!) by Mo Willems</p><p></p><h2>Star Fleet Technical Manual</h2><p>Manual is for the specific use of Star Fleet Academy Cadets</p><p></p><h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Divine Power, Roleplaying Game Supplement</h2><p>New options for clerics, paladins, and other divine characters.<br><br>This tome focuses on the divine heroes: characters whose powers rely on their faith as much as their sword, providing new archetypal builds for the cleric, paladin, and other divine classes, including new character powers, feats, paragon paths, and epic destinies.</p><p></p><h2>Content</h2><p>This book takes place at the cusp of the 20th and 21st centuries, in the pre and post-September 11th world. It is a singular product of its time, packed full of words and images portraying the architectural projects and metaphysical mechanics that have defined Rem Koolhas&#39;s OMA-AMO firm over the past seven years. In the format of a small, thick magazine, this &#34;&#34;book&#34;&#34; is more of an anti-book, an informal tribute the ephemeral world we inhabit. Focusing on the theme &#34;&#34;Go East,&#34;&#34; this visual journey follows OMA-AMO from San Francisco to Tokyo, traversing our massive and turbulent planet in search of &#34;&#34;an opportunity to realize the visions that make remaining at home torturous.&#34;&#34;</p><p>It's shaped like a trade paperback book, but its hellzapoppin pages look like a glossy, madcap magazine. Really, <i>Content</i> is more like an explosion in an idea factory, or a wild party thrown by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Rem Koolhaas in a mood considerably more delirious than his classic 1978 manifesto <i>Delirious New York</i>. It has 70 or 80 sections that look like magazine articles, and they're loosely organized in geographical order, from west to east. Pieces on Koolhaas's projects for Prada and MCA/Universal in LA and the acclaimed Seattle Public Library lead to syncopated meditations on Guggenheim Las Vegas, Chicago's van der Rohe "Miestakes," a modest plan to save Cambridge from Harvard by rechanneling the Charles River, Lagos' future as Earth's third-biggest town, the Hermitage's strange Russian past, Shanghai's Expo 2010, and Asia's skyscrapers, which now outnumber those of the West. When Koolhaas interviews Martha Stewart and gets a Las Vegas update from Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, it's straightforward, but many pages are as mystifying as hallucinations--apropos of nothing, a woman is depicted leaving her infrared heat signature on a tombstone, and Vermeer paintings are paired with scenes from TV's <i>Big Brother</i>. You don't read <i>Content</i> in linear fashion, you page through it amazed, gradually acquiring Koolhaas' ultracultivated taste for the bizarre. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Brendan McGetrick is a writer and editor from the United States. Before starting Content, he collaborated with Rem Koolhaas and AMO on a special issue of Wired magazine. He is a regular contributor to a few magazines, and is currently working on a new book about record collecting.

For Frankie, a murder committed may be the least of his problems.<br>The literary critic Malcolm Cowley called The Man with the Golden Arm "Algren's defense of the individual," while Carl Sandburg wrote of its "strange midnight dignity." A literary tour de force, here is a novel unlike any other, one in which drug addiction, poverty, and human failure somehow suggest a defense of human dignity and a reason for hope.</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettes<p>One of the most neglected of modern American authors and also one of the best loved, <b>NELSON ALGREN</b> (1909&#x2013;1981) believed that &#x201c;literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.&#x201d; His own voluminous body of work stands up to that belief. Algren&#x2019;s powerful voice rose from the urban wilderness of postwar Chicago, and it is to that city of hustlers, addicts and scamps that he returned again and again, eventually raising Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;lower depths&#x201d; up onto a stage for the whole world to behold. Recipient of the first National Book Award for fiction and lauded by Hemingway as &#x201c;one of the two best authors in America,&#x201d; Algren remains among our most defiant and enduring novelists. His work includes five major novels, two short fiction collections, a book-length poem and several collections of reportage. A source of inspiration to artists as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme, Studs Terkel and Lou Reed, Algren died on May 9, 1981, within days of his appointment as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p></p><h2>Find Colors: Published in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art</h2><p><p><strong>A colors book with no colors ? instead, die-cuts to peek through and find them yourself</strong></p><p>This introduction to colors integrates the reader's surroundings into carefully considered die-cut silhouettes, providing children the space to visually experiment.

In this sequel to Dr. Brown&#39;s best-selling book He Came to Set the Captives Free, you will learn to:* Stand victoriously against Satan.* Deal with the dangerous New Age teachings.* Recognize and deal with satanic ritualistic abuse of children.* Minister in the area of deliverance.* Handle the rarely discussed problems people face after deliverance.It&#39;s shocking! It&#39;s graphic! But this is war!Do you know how Satan can use &#34;doorways&#34; including yoga, role-playing games, and meditation, to bring demonic destruction into your home?Satan hates you and wants to destroy you. To be victorious you must Prepare for War.Rebecca Brown, M.D., was a young intern just out of medical school when she first encountered the activities of a group of Satanists. She began a lifelong journey of danger and excitement as she followed step-by-step the Lord&#39;s commands for her life. She learned complete trust and obedience as God faithfully guided her to truth and ultimate victory.This remarkable woman has ministered to thousands of people through her books, seminars and individual counseling. Dr. Brown&#39;s vast experience through personal encounters gives exceptional credibility to her teaching.While there are many Christian authors who write on the subject of the occult, few have the extensive hands-on experience of Rebecca. In fourteen years of ministry, Dr. Brown has led many people out of hard-core Satanism and all types of occult bondage, including Eastern mysticism and New Age philosophy, and into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. She has also effectively taught believers how to defend themselves against demonic activity by strengthening themselves daily in the Lord by obeying His Word.When Rebecca first encountered the shocking facts behind Satanism and the occult, there was little accurate information available on these dark and evil practices. Movies and television shows that portrayed the supernatural were regarded by the average viewer as fiction. By contrast, today it is common to see newspapers and talk shows discussing details of Satanic ritualistic abuse, demon possession and &#34;white&#34; witchcraft. In spite of the popularity of these topics, however, the full truth is not being accurately disclosed. As a result, there are massive numbers of Christians being deceived in their schools, on the job and even in their own churches.Rebecca candidly discusses the brutal facts and little-known secrets of the occult, such as placement of &#34;inserts&#34; and the practice of &#34;caging.&#34; She deals with demons in a no-nonsense manner that takes the &#34;three-ring circus&#34; out of deliverance. Her instruction is based on the simple steps of faith found in Scripture. She emphasizes that these steps are also necessary for the believer&#39;s entire Christian walk.Rebecca Brown has authored these best-selling books: He Came To Set The Captives Free, Prepare For War, Unbroken Curses, and Becoming A Vessel of Honor. They have been translated into over twelve languages and are used worldwide as teaching tools in churches and ministries. Her counsel is often sought by pastors, doctors and lawyers. In addition, her books are utilized by various U.S. law enforcement officials as part of their training programs for dealing with the occult.Although there are many Christian books exposing the occult, Dr. Brown&#39;s are among the few that offer definite answers and specific personal advice. They have helped countless people to pray effectively and to protect themselves from demonic attack and bondage.</p><h2>Trouble at Wild River (Adventures of the Northwoods, No. 5)</h2><p>In 1907 Wisconsin, Kate and her friends discover a timber swindler while visiting their Indian friend, Running Deer, and suspect that Kate&#39;s uncle, newly arrived from Sweden, may be involved.</p><p><b>Lois Walfrid Johnson</b> is the award-winning author of more than twenty books.

As she brushed aside the black hair escaping her braid, she looked ahead. Wildfire, the mare, trotted easily over the patches of snow, pulling the farm wagon in which Kate rode. <br> Far above, a lopsided moon lit the sky. On that cloudless March night the stars shone brightly, seeming just beyond the treetops. Sitting between her stepbrother Anders and her friend Erik Lundgren, Kate felt warm and safe. <br> Then, as Anders turned Wildfire onto a trail through the woods, an owl hooted. From off in the distance the call came-each note a lonesome cry. Kate shivered, but not from cold. <br> As the mare stretched out her legs, long shadows fell across the path. Like pointing fingers, pine branches reached toward the wagon, almost touching Kate. <br> Soon the call came again. <i>Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo-whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo-ah!</i> <br> "That's not an owl," said Erik in the quiet that followed. <br> "It isn't?" asked Kate. "Then what is it?" <br> "Someone signaling." The lantern Erik held cast a flickering light on his wavy brown hair. But certainty filled his eyes. "Shhhhh!" <br> Anders reined in the mare, and the hooting seemed closer this time. <br> "It's a barred owl," Anders said as the call faded away. <br> "No, it's not." Erik sounded sure of himself. "It's someone talking through the woods." <br> Anders laughed. "I thought Kate was the one with a big imagination." <br> "She is," said Erik. "This isn't imagination. It's real." <br> "Yah, sure," Anders told him. "You betcha." He flicked the reins across Wildfire's back, and the mare stepped out. <br> But Kate felt curious. "Erik, how do you know? Why do you think it's not an owl?" <br> "I can't explain it," he answered. "I just hear the difference." <br> As Wildfire trotted on, Kate stared into the darkness, hoping to catch a glimpse of a large owl. Yet she knew Erik was seldom wrong. His ability in music helped him recognize other sounds as well. <br> "If it's not an owl, what is it?" Kate asked. <br> "You mean <i>who</i> is it," said Anders. "<i>Who</i> is creeping around in the depths of night? <i>Who</i> is ready to snatch you from this wagon?" <br> "Oh, Anders!" Since coming to northwest Wisconsin, Kate had fought against her fear of the nighttime woods. Yet she didn't want to admit that fear to this stepbrother who was also thirteen. Like Erik, Anders was six feet tall and broad-shouldered from farm work. <br> Pretending she wasn't afraid, Kate gazed up into branches still without leaves from winter. No large owl flew from tree to tree. <br> In that March of 1907, the northwest Wisconsin days had been warm. Yet the nights dropped below freezing, providing perfect weather for a strong flow of sap from the sugar maples. For two weeks farmers and their families had worked hard, collecting the thin sap and boiling it down. <br> Dark came early to these woods, and Kate felt concerned that she'd miss what she wanted to see. "You're sure Joe's grandmother will still be making syrup?" Kate looked forward to meeting the Chippewa family. <br> "Yup," Anders told her. "He said his grandma would work late. She'll be finishing up for the day." <br> Joe's grandparents owned a farm on Trade River. Anders and Erik had known the Indian boy for some time, but Kate was new to the area. A year before, her mother had married Anders' father, and Mama and Kate moved from Minneapolis to Windy Hill Farm. <br> "Why does the Cloud family use trees near here?" Kate asked. <br> "They don't have sugar maples on their own land," Erik told her. "Usually they tap trees closer to home. This year Mrs. Cloud asked a farmer near Big Wood Lake if she could use his maples. When she gets done, she'll give him syrup and candy." <br> A grin crossed her brother's face. "You know, Kate, you can help Joe with all the work. That is, if you can keep up to him." <br> By now Kate knew Anders well enough to see through most of his teasing. Still she was curious. "What does he do?" <br> "Gathers wood to keep the fire going. Collects pails filled with sap. Brings 'em in to the fire." <br> "It's hard work," said Erik. "Joe's brothers help too. They start when the sap begins running in the morning and keep on till it slows down at night." <br> As Anders turned the mare into the ruts of yet another trail, Kate asked, "Where are you going?" <br> Anders flicked the reins. "Taking a shortcut along the lake." <br> "With all the warm weather, it might be mucky in there," Erik warned. <br> Anders acted as if he didn't hear. Before long, the trees on either side of the path thinned out. <br> Again Wildfire slowed her pace and stepped gingerly. Suddenly she sank knee-deep into mud. <br> Nervously the mare tossed her head. Anders clucked to her. "You're all right," Anders called, his voice soothing. "C'mon, girl. Giddyup!" <br> Wildfire turned her ears to the sound of his voice and lunged into the harness. The wagon jerked forward as the wheels churned through the mud.</p><h2>How to Train Your Dragon: How to Betray a Dragon&#39;s Hero (How to Train Your Dragon, 11)</h2><p>In Hiccup the Viking's misadventures, the stakes have never been higher, and it's friend versus foe to decide the fate of the world.

Confronted with a new set of obstacles, Bess manages to overcome her disability with the help of her new friends at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts, where she also learns how to read braille. Her twin sister, Elin, assists her with recording daily events in her diary and contributes entries of her own. Set against the backdrop of the Great Depression, Bess's story will inspire all readers to be strong in the face of hardship.</p><p>Grade 3-7-After Bess loses her eyesight in a sledding accident, she enters the Perkins School for the Blind. At first she fights against learning, especially braille, but gradually she adjusts to the school and her condition. Readers learn a great deal about how people compensate for vision loss, such as arranging food on a plate by the hours of the clock and placing their finger over a cup when pouring a liquid so that the fluid does not overflow. The information is well presented, as are Bess's feelings when people talk about her as if she were not there. However, the voice of the narrator is not always that of a 12-year-old, even in the 1930s. "My sorrow is unfathomable" is not a typical expression. It is also hard to believe that Bess would be able to remember the detail she includes in her diary, which she dictates to her sister when she returns home on the weekends. The book briefly alludes to the economic problems of the day and other news items, such as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Qualms aside, Bess's story should hold the interest of readers.<br><i>Margaret C. Howell, West Springfield Elementary School, VA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-8. Denenberg presents another entry in the Dear America series, this one set during the Depression. After being injured in a sledding accident, 12-year-old Bess Brennan loses her sight and is sent to the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts. During her weekend visits home, her twin sister helps her record her experiences in a diary; at school roommates help her familiarize herself with the Perkins campus and begin the slow process of learning Braille. A bit of melodrama comes from a subplot about a timid roommate and a cruel housemother. The myth that a blind person's remaining senses become more acute is not directly stated, though Bess does learn to pay more attention to clues she hears and smells. Readers may wish for more insight into the sisters' feelings about Bess' blindness, and the history is rather light here; it's the detail about the education of the visually impaired in times gone by that will keep readers involved. As with other books in the series, photos and a historical note are appended. <i>Catherine Andronik</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What is this psychological mechanism that allows us to know something is true but act as if it is not? George Marshall's search for the answers brings him face to face with Nobel Prize-winning psychologists and the activists of the Texas Tea Party; the world's leading climate scientists and the people who denounce them; liberal environmentalists and conservative evangelicals. What he discovered is that our values, assumptions, and prejudices can take on lives of their own, gaining authority as they are shared, dividing people in their wake. </p><p>With engaging stories and drawing on years of his own research, Marshall argues that the answers do not lie in the things that make us different and drive us apart, but rather in what we all share: how our human brains are wired-our evolutionary origins, our perceptions of threats, our cognitive blindspots, our love of storytelling, our fear of death, and our deepest instincts to defend our family and tribe. Once we understand what excites, threatens, and motivates us, we can rethink and reimagine climate change, for it is not an impossible problem. Rather, it is one we can halt if we can make it our common purpose and common ground. Silence and inaction are the most persuasive of narratives, so we need to change the story. </p><p>In the end, <i>Don't Even Think About It</i> is both about climate change and about the qualities that make us human and how we can grow as we deal with the greatest challenge we have ever faced.</p></p><p><b>George Marshall</b> is the founder of the Climate Outreach and Information Network, based in Oxford UK, and over the past 25 years has worked at all levels of theenvironmental movement including senior positions for Greenpeace US and the Rainforest Foundation.

He lives in Wales. His website is http://climatedenial.org/.<p>&#x201c;[Marshall] offers advice on confronting climate change head on, stepping away from Green Guilt, and putting potentially world-saving policies into action.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Intelligent and genial . . . In the end, Marshall is neither fatalistic nor idealistic about our chances of survival. Yes, he says, we're wired to ignore climate change. But we're also wired to do something about it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Clearly we're not responding to the reality of climate change with the speed the crisis requires.

His work is a much needed kick in the pants for policymakers, grassroots environmentalists, and the public to induce us to develop effective motivational tools to help us take action to face the reality of climate change before it's too late.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fantastic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Grist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Essential reading for everyone interested in communicating the science of climate change and its urgent policy implications.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Critical Angle</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is not a book to read and put away--but one that merits returning to and engaging with intellectually.

I was given a lot of creative freedom to really make my books stand out and to really do something unique with them.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</p> <p><strong> JL:</strong> Even though I love these characters and the stories that came before, at the end of the day I still have to make them my own. So if I were to just try and replicate the stories I enjoyed, it wouldn't be very much fun for me or the reader. I think the key is to boil each character down to its core concept and build up from there. Make it fresh and put as much of yourself into them as you can.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What stories or creators inspire you most when working on your character?</p> <p><strong> JL:</strong> For <em>Animal Man</em>, I was definitely inspired by the often-overlooked run by writer Jamie Delano and artist Steve Pugh. And now I'm working with Steve on the book! And of course, you can't overlook what Grant Morrision brought to the character in his definitive run.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> I think we can all agree that <em>Animal Man</em> was the breakout hit of The New 52. Was it a bit surprising for you to see such a strong response?</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> Yes, it is. I tried to put as much of myself into the book as I could, and I think when the art started coming in, I had a sense that we were doing something really good, but you never know how the audience will respond. I never expected it to resonate with so many people. I think <em>Animal Man</em> is just a character that so many people can relate to because he is a father and a husband first, and a superhero second. Just like me.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> You and Scott Snyder tend to Twitter War each other often. How has this affected you when it comes to writing <em>Animal Man</em> and its relation to <em>Swamp Thing</em>?</p> <p><strong>JL:</strong> Scott and I are the best of friends, so we often give each other a hard time online. Truth is we spend a lot of time talking about our stories and characters together. We feed off of each other. Fans will get to see that first hand when our <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> story lines intersect later this year. It isn't one of those crossovers that editorial puts together and forces on you, its a story that grew organically out of us sharing ideas and scripts for our two books and realizing that there was a lot of potential in really interweaving our stories into a greater mythology. </p>Jeff Lemire is the creator of the acclaimed <i>Essex County</i> <i>Trilogy</i>, the Vertigo graphic novel <i>The Nobody</i>, and is the winner of a Xeric Award and YALSA Alex Award.

Scott Peterson's sister gives her account of his marriage and his disturbing behaviour &#x2013; and tells how she realised that her brother was capable of murder. </p><p> What happens if, after being given up for adoption in childhood, you reestablish contact with your biological family &#x2013; only to discover that your true brother is a killer? Anne Bird, the sister of Scott Peterson, knows first&#x2013;hand.</p><p> Soon after her birth in 1965, Anne was given up for adoption by her mother, Jackie Latham. Welcomed into the well&#x2013;adjusted Grady family, she lived a happy life. Then, in the late 1990s, she got back in contact with her mother &#x2013; now married &#x2013; and her family, including Jackie's son, Scott Peterson, and his wife, Laci. Over the next several years, Anne shared the Petersons' holidays, family reunions, trips to Disneyland. Anne and Laci became pregnant at roughly the same time, and the two became confidantes. On Christmas Eve 2002, Laci Peterson went missing, and the happy facade of the Peterson family began to crumble. Anne helped in the search for Laci; Scott even stayed in her home while police tried to find his wife. Noticing Scott's bizarre behaviour, Anne grew suspicious that her brother knew more than he was telling. Then Laci's body &#x2013; and that of her unborn son, Conner &#x2013; were found . Had Scott Peterson murdered his wife and child in cold blood?</p><p> Filled with newsmaking revelations and intimate glimpses of Scott and Laci, Blood Brother is an account of how long&#x2013;dormant family ties dragged one woman into one of the most notorious crimes of our time. </p></p><p><p>The mother of two sons, Anne Bird lives outside of San Francisco, California.</p>As true crime books go, this addition to the Scott and Laci Peterson library isn't particularly riveting, salacious or revealing, which is strange considering Bird's unique perspective. Adopted as a child, Bird reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, Scott's mother, in late 1997. Bird takes every opportunity to stress that she grew very close to the Peterson family, but there's very little evidence of this apart from Bird's own assertions. The reader learns tidbits about Scott and Laci: i.e., Laci loved flowers, and Scott "was a real charmer, the kind of guy who lights up a room." But such details hover on the surface. In fact, this book reveals more about the author's self-delusional behavior than the crime itself. Laci's abduction occurs early on, and for the rest of the book, Bird relates how, despite all evidence to the contrary, she refused to believe her brother could be guilty. Her denial is such that, after Scott's arrest, Bird writes letters to him in which she replaces the word "jail" with "camp." Despite Bird's frequent protestations, one wonders if she isn't disingenuous at times. She professes her love for her birth mother, for example, yet paints her in an unflattering light ("I was beginning to understand why Jackie was so critical of Laci. No one was good enough for her golden boy"). With the help of a therapist, Bird finally accepts the evidence and devises her list of 33 reasons why her brother is guilty. This list-which takes up a mere five pages and offers such banal reasons as Scott "flirted with our babysitter"-is just as superficial as the rest of the book.

In Hell, the damned have chosen a prophet; on Earth, humanity becomes increasingly indifferent; and in the "soft places" between realities, grudges are being nursed into conspiracy. The archangel Michael lies dead at the base of the World Tree, and his power, let loose, burns his daughter Elaine and his brother Lucifer out of this universe and into a newborn one. Their absence allows the first woman, Lilith, and a handful of others to plot grabbing power from Heaven while the Powers in the Silver City remain disoriented. In this exciting beginning of a thrilling, high-stakes story, the fluid artwork ventures into some strikingly expressionistic manners that help in translating some very alien landscapes. The relative absence of series protagonist Lucifer adds to an aura of anxiety and anticipation. Series fans and those with passing knowledge of theology will be on firmer ground in this volume, but <i>Crux</i> exerts more than enough allure to garner new admirers. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But on June 6, 1944, at Utah Beach, he learned more about war than he had gleaned from all the books he&#39;d read combined. General Maxwell Taylor assigned Sergeant Nibley to educate the officers of the 101st Airborne about warfare. But it was the professor himself that received an education while fighting as a member of the most legendary unit of the United States Army. Most war memoirs come either from the bird&#39;s-eye view of the general or from the visceral but limited scope of the common soldier. Because of Nibley&#39;s unique situation, this book blends both perspectives. From the narrow view of a sergeant in a foxhole to the broader perspective of an intelligence specialist, his experience offers an intimate, realistic and articulate view of World War II.</p><p>Most war memoirs come either from the bird&#39;s eye view of the general or from the visceral but limited scope of the common soldier.

For this reason, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Gordon S. Wood believes that the American Revolution is the most important event in our history, bar none. Since American identity is so fluid and not based on any universally shared heritage, we have had to continually return to our nation's founding to understand who we are. In <i>The Idea of America</i>, Wood reflects on the birth of American nationhood and explains why the revolution remains so essential. <br><br> In a series of elegant and illuminating essays, Wood explores the ideological origins of the revolution-from ancient Rome to the European Enlightenment-and the founders' attempts to forge an American democracy. As Wood reveals, while the founders hoped to create a virtuous republic of yeoman farmers and uninterested leaders, they instead gave birth to a sprawling, licentious, and materialistic popular democracy. <br><br> Wood also traces the origins of American exceptionalism to this period, revealing how the revolutionary generation, despite living in a distant, sparsely populated country, believed itself to be the most enlightened people on earth. The revolution gave Americans their messianic sense of purpose-and perhaps our continued propensity to promote democracy around the world-because the founders believed their colonial rebellion had universal significance for oppressed peoples everywhere. Yet what may seem like audacity in retrospect reflected the fact that in the eighteenth century republicanism was a truly radical ideology-as radical as Marxism would be in the nineteenth-and one that indeed inspired revolutionaries the world over. <br><br> Today there exists what Wood calls a terrifying gap between us and the founders, such that it requires almost an act of imagination to fully recapture their era. Because we now take our democracy for granted, it is nearly impossible for us to appreciate how deeply the founders feared their grand experiment in liberty could evolve into monarchy or dissolve into licentiousness. Gracefully written and filled with insight, <i>The Idea of America</i> helps us to recapture the fears and hopes of the revolutionary generation and its attempts to translate those ideals into a working democracy.</p><p><b>Gordon S. Wood </b>is the Alva O. Way University Professor Emeritus at Brown University. His 1969 book, <i>The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787</i>, received the Bancroft and John H. Dunning prizes and was nominated for the National Book Award. His 1992 book, <i>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize and the Emerson Prize. His 2009 book, <i>Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815</i>, won the New-York Historical Society Prize in American History. In 2011 Wood was awarded a National Humanities Medal by&nbsp;President Obama. &nbsp;Wood contributes regularly to the <i>New Republic </i>and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>.<p>&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;Mr. Wood is the premier student of the Founding Era.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Gordon S.

These massive offensives were shocking in their scale and intensity, and hugely important. Yet they are largely ignored in the West. Now, with the work of internationally renowned Eastern Front expert Prit Buttar, this story of the unknown side of World War I is finally being told.</p><p>In Germany Ascendant, Buttar examines the critical year of 1915, when Germany launched the great Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive, lead by Field Marshal Mackensen. The move, which started as a minor German operation to relieve their Austro-Hungarian allies, ultimately resulted in the utter collapse of Russian forces from all of Poland and Gallacia, and came tantalizingly close to knocking Russia out of the war altogether. Next the Germans led the invasion of Serbia, leading Britain and France to intervene with ground troops, an operation that ultimately failed.</p><p>Yet despite this unbroken string of successes, Germany was still hamstrung by a two-front war. Her every attempt to knock Russia out of the war--military and diplomatic--has failed. The stage was then set for the next phase of the war when Russia launched its own counter-offensive that nearly brought the Central Powers to their knees.</p></p><p>Prit Buttar studied medicine in Oxford and London before joining the British Army as a doctor.

The Thanksgiving Sing was special. So was the Spellathon. The Emerging Artists exhibition was special. Even the unassuming Pie Drive was, for reasons not clearly revealed by the newsletter coverage, special indeed. And, finally, this year's third-grade class was in itself a very, very special group.<br><br>I wondered, Is it possible? So much specialness concentrated in one place? A cosmic coincidence? Or was this really an extraordinary school with unusually dazzling children, committed teachers, generous and energetic families? In fact, this school is a fine and good one. The children are intelligent and well behaved, the teachers care, the parents give of their time and money. But it is not a terribly unusual school, and I questioned the benefit of believing otherwise.<br><br>The third-grade newsletter was not unique. At nearly every campus I visit, the staff, the posters on the walls, and the overall atmosphere emphasize that this is not merely a place of learning, it's a breeding ground for enlightened, compassionate champions. The schools are not to blame for their hubris. Parents, with their grand expectations for their children, have sparked the outbreak of specialness.<br><br>My friend Paula, who runs a terrific elementary school, told of taking a mother on a prospective parents' tour of the campus. The mom said that her daughter Sloane had a strong interest in science. "At another school I visited, the kindergarten teachers put streamers in the trees to demonstrate the properties of wind to the students," she reported. "I'm hoping you would do that here too. I wouldn't want Sloaner to miss out."<br><br>"We have leaves on our trees," Paula responded. "They do the same thing. Can't guarantee we'll be using streamers." Sloane's mother sent her daughter to the school with the streamers.<br><br>The principal of another school complained to me about his frustration with parents' expectations:<br><br>Too many parents want everything fixed by the time their child is eight. They want academic perfection, a child as capable as any other child in the Western hemisphere. Children develop in fits and starts, but nobody has time for that anymore. No late bloomers, no slow starters, nothing unusual accepted! If a child doesn't get straight A's, his parents start fretting that he's got a learning disability or a motivation problem. The normal curve has disappeared. Parents seem to think that children only come in two flavors: learning disabled and gifted. Not every child has unlimited potential in all areas. This doesn't mean most kids won't be able to go to college and to compete successfully in the adult world. Almost all of them will. Parents just need to relax a little and be patient.<br><br>What's going on here? Why does the newsletter shout hosannas? Why is Sloane's mother so anxious for her daughter to experience a miniature physics lab in kindergarten? Why can't parents let their eight-year-olds develop at a natural, raggedy pace?<br><br>When I began studying Judaism, one of the first things that struck me was how directly it spoke to the issue of parental pressure. According to Jewish thought, parents should not expect their children to be anyone other than who they are. A Hasidic teaching says, "If your child has a talent to be a baker, don't tell him to be a doctor." Judaism holds that every child is made in the divine image. When we ignore a child's intrinsic strengths in an effort to push him toward our notion of extraordinary achievement, we are undermining God's plan.<br><br>If the pressure to be special gets too intense, children end up in the therapist's office suffering from sleep and eating disorders, chronic stomachaches, hair-pulling, depression, and other ailments. They are casualties of their parents' drive for perfection. It was children such as these who spurred me to look outside standard therapeutic practices for ways to help. In Judaism I found an approach that respects children's uniqueness while accepting them in all their ordinary glory.<br><br>MISSION: PERFECTION<br><br>In Chapter 1 I described my surprise and confusion when, after conducting tests and telling parents that their child was "within normal limits," the parents were frequently disappointed. In their view, a diagnosable problem was better than a normal, natural limitation. A problem can be fixed, but a true limitation requires adjustment of expectations and acceptance of an imperfect son or daughter. Parents feel hope if their restless child is actually hyperactive, their dreamy child has ADD, their poor math student has a learning disorder, their shy child has a social phobia, their wrongdoing son has "intermittent explosive disorder." If there is a diagnosis, specialists and tutors can be hired, drugs given, treatment plans made, and parents can maintain an illusion that the imperfection can be overcome. Their faith in their child's unlimited potential is restored.<br><br>Why are parents so anxious to be raising perfect children? The answer is twofold: pride and fear of the future.<br><br><i>My Child, My Masterpiece</i><br><br>Janet asked for advice from me and the other members of our parenting class about how to "talk sense" to her older son.<br><br>Do you know about the Johns Hopkins Talent Search? They offer sixth graders the chance to take the SAT. If a student scores in the same range as the average twelfth grader on either verbal or math he qualifies for a special summer academic program on a college campus. I know that Dylan would qualify in math but he says he doesn't want to sit for the test. This is crazy because the school wouldn't even know his score and if he makes it and enters the talent search program it would look great on his transcript.<br><br>Laypeople call it bragging; psychologists describe it as "achievement by proxy syndrome." Some parents use their children's achievements for their own sense of security, personal glory, or the fulfillment of unfulfilled dreams. Even parents who don't use their children as a hedge against existential fears or a badge of their own worth can find it hard not to succumb to the fever of competition.<br><br>It wasn't always this way. In the past, parents produced children for their work value (hands to labor on the farm). Today many parents see their children's achievement as an important family "product." This attitude leads to an upside-down, child-centered perspective where we cater to children's whims yet pressure them to achieve at all costs -- academically, socially, and athletically. But this pressure can backfire.<br><br>Children who feel that they are expected to surpass their parents' already high level of achievement or to demonstrate skills that are beyond their capabilities will suffer. Some children are one-trick ponies, and trying to get them to master a broad variety of skills is futile and destructive. Keep at it, and they'll even forget their one trick. Other children begin to feel as if they are working only for their parents' satisfaction, and they openly rebel. Some respond to the pressure by losing their intrinsic enjoyment of mastering skills, and still others use psychosomatic symptoms to get out of the running. By exaggerating their defects, these children hope to avoid failure and to have their progress measured by more individual, realistic standards.<br><br>Your child is not your masterpiece. According to Jewish thought, your child is not even truly "yours." In Hebrew there is no verb for possession; the expression we translate as "to have," <i>yesh li,</i> actually means "it is there for me" or "there is for me." Although nothing belongs to us, God has made everything available on loan and has invited us to borrow it to further the purpose of holiness. This includes our children. They are a precious loan, and each one has a unique path toward serving God. Our job is to help them find out what it is.<br><br><i>Conquering the Future with Brave Little Generalists</i><br><br>If children were required to excel only in certain areas, they might be better able to cope with their parents' expectations. Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we make unfairly "generic" demands on our adolescents: "It is the only period in your life when you're expected to do all things well. Adults don't hold themselves to those standards. We don't interview the pediatrician about whether he can throw a basketball, or quiz our accountant on biology before we let her do our taxes. In elementary and high school we celebrate the generalist, but in the real world there is no room for the generalist except on Jeopardy!"<br><br>The age at which we expect children to become very good at everything is getting lower. Part of the reason for this is parents' fears of an uncertain future, one that is hurtling at us more quickly than ever before. The computer bought today can be replaced by a cheaper, lighter, snappier-looking one with a faster modem by the time we get it out of the box. Parents worry that in this hyperpaced world, only the child who excels at everything will survive. If young Maya can't design her own Web site, stay at the very top of her class, run a marathon, and speak confidently before large groups, she'll be left in the dust.<br><br>Our attempts to prepare our children for the future are limited by our own imaginations of what the future will be like. We're apprehensive, but our children are not. The high-tech, rapidly changing world that seems so mind-bending to us is normal to them. "Preparing" our children for this new world by turning them into supercompetitive generalists is useless because we can't second-guess the skills they will need twenty years from now. The only things that are certain to be valuable are character traits such as honesty, tenacity, flexibility, optimism, and compassion -- the same traits that have served people well for centuries.<br><br><i>Fear of the Ordinary: Lake Wobegon Parenting</i><br><br>Remember Lake Wobegon, the fictional town created by Garrison Keillor, where "all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average"? That sunny, statistics-defying state of mind is familiar turf for elementary school teachers. They describe hearing the same song every year when it's time for parent conferences. One weary middle school director told me,<br><br>Parents are so nervous. If their child is doing well in everything it's like a badge for them that everything is OK. If their child is, God forbid, average, they panic. That's why so many teachers have started giving "Lake Wobegon" report cards. Teachers are afraid that if they give anything less than an A, parents will blame their child's poor achievement on the teacher's lack of skill rather than on the child's limitations. This is a shame, because real problems get glossed over or missed until fourth grade, when there's no more hiding it and the child's weaker areas show up on standardized tests.<br><br>Some parents can maintain the specialness myth with their children long past fourth grade. Is this good for the child's self-esteem? Listen to Isabel, a student I interviewed at an elite private school. Isabel will be entering the eleventh grade next year. She told me that she was having a hard time socially. The last two boys she wanted to have as boyfriends hadn't been interested in her. Her teachers seemed to favor other students. She felt confused and hurt:<br><br>I know why this is so hard for me. My mom and dad always, always made me feel like I was the best: the most beautiful, the smartest, the most charming. And mostly I've done well in everything. But, now I'm finding out that I'm not that unusual. Maybe I'm good enough, but I don't know anymore.<br><br>Like so many parents, Isabel's mother and father were afraid their daughter would think she was ordinary. Whether they were also reluctant to admit to themselves that their child was "merely" average, I don't know. But their Lake Wobegon attitude has not benefited Isabel. They've put her on a pedestal and now she's stuck up there, unable to find out what level she would reach if she had a chance to bob around with everybody else.<br><br><i>Boys and Girls: Equal but Different</i><br><br>There is another aspect of contemporary child-rearing that places still more pressure on our children. Over the past twenty years, teachers and social scientists have downplayed the differences between boys and girls. It's been done as a corrective to a history of inequality, but the result is that we've come to expect boys to behave like girls and girls like boys in circumstances where this is difficult for them. There's no question that all children should be encouraged to pursue whatever field interests them, but a gender-blind approach can sometimes increase the stress on our overstressed kids. Gone are the gender-based safe havens of the past; now both sexes have the opportunity -- the obligation -- to excel in every arena, from academics to sports, from being a good listener to being a leader.<br><br>God is the original maker of distinctions: light from darkness, the seventh day of rest from the six days of labor, sacred from profane. While remaining aware of the potential for discrimination, we can also remain respectful of innate distinctions between boys and girls. For example, their interests and developmental stages are often different. Instead of trying to ignore or flatten these differences, we can pay attention to the ways they are revealed in our children's behavior. If you fear that acknowledging any gender differences will lead to unfair treatment, your children may miss out on getting what they need. In order to treat our daughters and sons fairly it is sometimes necessary to treat them differently. Honoring distinctions can lead to equal opportunity.<br><br><i>Inappropriate Expectations of Boys</i><br><br>Laurie's son, Noah, was born when her daughter, Rachel, was four. "I was amazed at the differences from the start," she said. "When Noah was a baby he shouted 'Ball!' whenever he saw the letter O. He insisted that I walk on the trafficky side of the street instead of the lovely tree-lined residential side so he could see the trucks up close. He called out to every one, 'Rrruuum! Rrruuum!'"<br><br>Noah concentrated so hard that he could do only one thing at a time. If Laurie wanted him to listen to her, she had to hold his three-year-old face in her hands. She couldn't take him with her on errands because he'd run away. Laurie and her husband, Mark, decided that they would never allow Noah to have toy guns or to watch TV, only educational videos. That didn't stop Noah from shooting at everything -- he'd just cock his finger or make a gun out of his toast or a graham cracker.<br><br>What will happen when this truck-loving, hyperfocused, shoot-'em-up guy gets to kindergarten? When he has to sit still at a table for a chunk of the day and practice printing upper- and lowercase letters? When he has to cooperate nicely <i>all day long?</i> When no fart noises or finger guns are permitted? ("Noah, I know you remember how to use your words, right, Noah?")<br><br>Here's what his teacher might tell Laurie: "Noah has such a hard time sitting still and following instructions. We're wondering if this might be ADD. Of course, Noah is too young for us to know for sure yet. But you might consider having him tested next year."<br><br>Kindergarten used to be a place for making clay handprints, singing songs, and listening to stories, nothing more. The teacher's goal was to help the children learn how to be part of a group and to swim around in a pond bigger than their own home and family. But in many schools today the early elementary grades have become a time fo...</p><h2>If Beale Street Could Talk</h2><p>The relationship between two lovers and their families is the focus of If Beale Street Could Talk (1974).

Jefferson Cowie&#x2019;s edgy and incisive book part political intrigue, part labor history, with large doses of American musical, film, and TV lore makes new sense of the 1970s as a crucial and poorly understood transition from New Deal America (with its large, optimistic middle class) to the widening economic inequalities, poverty, and dampened expectations of the 1980s and into the present.<br> <br> <i>Stayin&#x2019; Alive</i> takes us from the factory floors of Ohio, Pittsburgh, and Detroit, to the Washington of Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Cowie also connects politics to culture, showing how the big screen and the jukebox can help us understand how America turned away from the radicalism of the 1960s and toward the patriotic promise of Ronald Reagan. Cowie makes unexpected connections between the secrets of the Nixon White House and the failings of George McGovern campaign; radicalism and the blue-collar backlash; the earthy twang of Merle Haggard&#x2019;s country music and the falsetto highs of <i>Saturday Night Fever.</i> Like Jeff Perlstein&#x2019;s acclaimed <i>Nixonland,</i> <i>Stayin&#x2019; Alive</i> moves beyond conventional understandings of the period and brilliantly plumbs it for insights into our current way of life.</p><p>The tortuous path from Nixon to Reagan--think Archie Bunker, <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>, and Merle Haggard--in a major new work on the cultural and political history of the 1970s, from a prizewinning historianJefferson Cowie is an associate professor of history at Cornell University.

He decides to upgrade his menu and creates a beautiful meatball, but his assistant's sneeze blows it out the window. The ensuing meatball chase takes the two through the Piggly Wiggly, past the police station and to the ballpark. The meatball is whacked all the way back to the Emporium &amp; Musicale, but it has turned to mush. Fortunately, the mush grows into a meatball-and-sauce bearing tree. If the whole story sounds a tad familiar, that's to be expected: Johnson has used Glazer's classic song as a jumping-off point for silly extravaganza. The combination of the familiar refrain and Johnson's bright cartoon illustrations is sure to please young listeners, though the observant among them will likely point out that the meatball does more flying than rolling following the initial sneeze. Music and recipes are included for those who want the full experience. (Picture book. 2-8)<br><br>Booklist<br>PreS Gr. 2. In this picture-book invitation to a noisy storytime, seasoned author-illustrator Johnson extends songwriter Tom Glazer's classic anthem to spaghetti with an original frame story. When a gimmicky snack shop steals customers from a spaghetti caf� run by a beagle and mouse, the proprietors set out to concoct the most dee-licious meatball this side of Sicily.&#x201d; Johnson's thickly outlined, ebullient acrylics show the delectable creation launched forth by a giant sneeze, ultimately sprouting into a meatball tree that puts the pasta joint back in the black. Lines from the song appear sandwiched between paragraphs of text, and the discontinuous presentation of the familiar lyrics may initially confuse children. But the slapstick, folksy tone of Johnson's contributions especially the recurring exclamation, Pardon my meatball!&#x201d; as the foodstuff ricochets pinball-style around the community will help to refocus children's attention from singing to listening. This jaunty offering will undoubtedly enter the sing-along rotation, and will have particular savor on days when spaghetti is on the lunch menu. Jennifer Mattson<br>SLJ<br>PreS-Gr 2 Expanding on the popular song, Johnson spins the tale of Yodeler Jones, a hound dog who serves nothing but meatballs and spaghetti at his dining establishment. When business begins to slow, Yodeler concocts a brand-new meatball, but before he can taste it, someone sneezes, setting the song into action with the pooch and his animal pals in pursuit of the flyaway meatball. With original text printed in black and the lyrics sprinkled throughout in color, this story successfully marries the two. The loony illustrations, full of color and movement, effectively capture the zaniness. Pair this book with Judi Barrett's Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (S &amp; S, 1998) and Ryan SanAngelo's Spaghetti Eddie (Boyds Mills, 2002) for a yummy storytime treat. Lisa Gangemi Kropp, Middle Country Public Library, Centereach, NY<br><br>PW<br>Johnson offers readers a goofy backstory for the popular folk song parody, much along the same lines as his look at another novelty hit, Little Bunny Foo Foo. Here, he posits that the title song is about a struggling canine chef named Yodeler Jones who claims that, ever since the fried fritter fricassee parlor moved next door, "I couldn't haul in a customer with a line and pole." When a mouse assistant sneezes and sends a promising meatball flying, the lyrics of the song start wafting through the pages ("It rolled off the table/ And onto the floor,/ And then my poor meatball/ Rolled out of the door"), while Yodeler's first-person narrative fills in the details of his meatball pursuit. In keeping with the song's lesser-known third and fourth verses (the entire song appears on the final page), the dog's fortune is made when the mushed meatball somehow yields (overnight) a magical tree that produces "the most dee-licious meatbaPreS-Gr. 2. In this picture-book invitation to a noisy storytime, seasoned author-illustrator Johnson extends songwriter Tom Glazer's classic anthem to spaghetti with an original frame story. When a gimmicky snack shop steals customers from a spaghetti cafe run by a beagle and mouse, the proprietors set out to concoct "the most dee-licious meatball this side of Sicily." Johnson's thickly outlined, ebullient acrylics show the delectable creation launched forth by a giant sneeze, ultimately sprouting into a meatball tree that puts the pasta joint back in the black. Lines from the song appear sandwiched between paragraphs of text, and the discontinuous presentation of the familiar lyrics may initially confuse children. But the slapstick, folksy tone of Johnson's contributions--especially the recurring exclamation, "Pardon my meatball!" as the foodstuff ricochets pinball-style around the community--will help to refocus children's attention from singing to listening. This jaunty offering will undoubtedly enter the sing-along rotation, and will have particular savor on days when spaghetti is on the lunch menu. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She graduated from Wesleyan University in 1997, from the Graduate Program in Documentary Film and Video at Stanford University in 2000, and began her work with the Bene Israel community of India while on a Fulbright Scholarship. This is her first book.Starred Review. Who is Rachel Jacobs? the 13-year-old asks her Muslim grandmother Rahat Siddiqi; that, Nana tells her, was my name before I was married. Thus does a grandmother's stunning reply and a granddaughter's promise to learn about her ancestors set Shepard's three voyages of discovery in motion: her grandmother's history; the story of the Bene Israel (one of the lost tribes of Israel that, having sailed from Israel two millennia ago, crashed on the Konkan coast in India; and her own self-discovery (her mother was Muslim, her father Christian, and her grand mother Jewish). Shepard balances all three journeys with dexterity as she spends her Fulbright year, with an old hand-drawn map and her grandmother's family tree, unraveling the mysteries of Nana's past while visiting and photographing the grand and minuscule synagogues in Bombay and on the Konkan Coast. A filmmaker, Shepard writes with a lively sense of pacing (her year proceeds chronologically, interspersed with well-placed flashbacks) and a keen sense of character (getting to know her friend, escort and fellow filmmaker Rekhev as gradually as she does, or capturing the Muslim baker who makes the only authentic challah in Bombay in a few strokes). Shepard's story is entertaining and instructive, inquiring and visionary. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He strolled up a set of rickety steps and into a smoky gambling den ringing with jeers of card sharks and crapshooters. By the time anyone recognized the infamous bullwhip dangling from his hand, it was too late. Single-handedly, the feared, five-foot-tall Hawaiian cop, Chang Apana, had lined up forty gamblers and marched them down to the police station.<br><br> So begins Charlie Chan, Yunte Huang&#x2019;s absorbing history of the legendary Cantonese detective, born in Hawaii around 1871, who inspired a series of fiction and movie doubles that long defined America&#x2019;s distorted perceptions of Asians and Asian Americans. In chronicling the real-life story and the fraught narrative of one of Hollywood&#x2019;s most iconic detectives, Huang has fashioned a historical drama where none was known to exist, creating a work that will, in the words of Jonathan Spence, &#x201c;permanently change the way we tell this troubled yet gripping story.&#x201d;<br><br> Himself a literary sleuth, Huang has traced Charlie Chan&#x2019;s evolution from island legend to pop culture icon to vilified, postmodern symbol, ingeniously juxtaposing Apana&#x2019;s rough-and-tumble career against the larger backdrop of a territorial Hawaii torn apart by virulent racism. Apana&#x2019;s bravado prompted not only Earl Derr Biggers, a Harvard graduate turned author, to write six Charlie Chan mysteries but also Hollywood to manufacture over forty movies starring a grammatically challenged detective with a knack for turning Oriental wisdom into singsong Chinatown blues.<br><br> Examining hundreds of biographical, literary, and cinematic sources, in English and in his native Chinese, Huang has pursued the trail of Charlie Chan since the mid-1990s, searching for clues in places as improbable as Harvard Yard, an Ohio cornfield, a weathered Hawaiian cemetery, and the Shanghai Bund. His efforts to refashion the Charlie Chan legend became a personal mission, as if the answers he sought would reshape his own identity&#x2015;no longer a top Chinese student but an immigrant American eager to absorb the bewildering history of his adopted homeland.<br><br> &#x201c;With rare personal intensity and capacious intelligence,&#x201d; Huang has ascribed a starring role to &#x201c;the honorable detective,&#x201d; one far more enduring than any of his wisecracking movie parts. Huang presents American history in a way that it has never been told before. 35 black-and-white photographs and illustrations</p><p><p>Praise for <em>Charlie Chan</em></p><p>&#x201c;An ingenious and absorbing book that provides a convincing new mode for examining the Chinese experience through both Chinese and Western eyes.

Mordred reigns with a brutal hand, and Arthur sees his dreams of peace evaporate.

The French love of food is primordial. They love food the way we love our Grand Canyon, our freedom, and our waves of grain&#x2014;primitively, instinctively, fundamentally. Their love for food is overwhelmingly universal&#x2014;it permeates the air, the life, the lifestyle, and the habits of all in this country.<br><br>This love of food resonated from the day I set foot in France and smelled butter in the air. It was a chilly day in March, and I had just arrived on an early flight. nothing was open in Paris that morning, and I walked to stay warm, inhaling that buttery smell that would balloon into intensity each time I passed a boulangerie.<br><br>When one finally opened its doors, I stepped inside and bought my&nbsp;first French croissant. It shattered all over me when I bit into it, and&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve never been the same since.&nbsp;This buttery, shattery moment led me to a French life. There was, of course, a lot more involved. But that croissant was like a perfect first kiss at the start of a lifelong romance.<br><br> Since then, I&#x2019;ve discovered just how much the French love food, which has allowed me to openly love it, too. I always loved it, which made me something of an <i>extra-terrestre </i>when I was in college and after. Then, friends and colleagues greeted my love of cooking with skepticism and friendly derision, as if to say, &#x201c;Who on earth would want to spend time cooking?&#x201d; The minute I came to France I was surrounded by like minds, and my somewhat suppressed passion came fully out of the closet.<br><br>Fast-forward to a life in France raising children, writing books, teaching cooking classes, settling myself into a culture where food is the linchpin, the gathering point, the warmth in a cold world of politics, social upheaval, complex religious persuasions, and every- thing else that composes our contemporary French world. Here, I&#x2019;m surrounded by people who love food.<br><br>Take Edith, my friend and cohort in many an exploit for thirty years. She is the antithesis of the stay-at-home mom, though that&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;s been for nearly thirty years. The thing is, she coddles no one, believes that a harsh life is better than a soft one, wears Birkenstock sandals every day of the year regardless of the temperature, and is always dressed in items of designer clothing that she assembles with the flair of a diva. As for her four kids, they were born, they were fed, they were schooled, and now they&#x2019;re out of the house, all of them strong individuals with passions of their own.<br><br>What did Edith do with her time? She painted, landscapes and portraits that enchant everyone who sees them. She has many&nbsp;other passions&#x2014;remodeling, sewing, hunting down bargains on eBay. One of her most notable passions is her love of eating. I&#x2019;ve never encountered anyone who approaches meals with so much gusto. When she sits down in front of something she loves, you&#x2019;d better be sure to serve yourself quickly because otherwise she is likely to eat it all, with big, appreciative mouthfuls, down to the last crumb.<br><br>I see a lot of Edith. For one thing, I often swim in the pool she and her husband, Bernard, thoughtfully put in their backyard. If she isn&#x2019;t making lunch when I arrive, she&#x2019;s about to sit and eat it, and it&#x2019;s always a hot meal. Lately it&#x2019;s been boiled potatoes with mustardy vinaigrette and smoked herring (it&#x2019;s herring season). But it might as easily be thick, herb-rich potage, or pasta with lots of garlic and a shower of Comt�, or a mass of vegetables that she pulled from her garden and braised with bay leaf and thyme.<br><br>Edith wouldn&#x2019;t dream of eating something she considered less than scrumptious, which for her is heavily weighted to vegetables, garlic, and olive oil. Her refrigerator is mostly empty, but half their property is given over to a vegetable garden where her neighbor, Mr. Harel, has tended the same few crops for at least fifteen years. There are leeks and carrots, lettuces and potatoes, onions, green beans, and a big row of red currants. It never varies (which would drive me crazy because I like variety, but which suits Edith just fine). As long as she has these fresh staples, her life&#x2014;and her diet&#x2014; are complete.<br><br>What I find fascinating about Edith, aside from her colorful nature, is the time she spends cooking. She has absolutely no passion for it, yet her intense passion for eating drives her into the kitchen twice a day.&nbsp;She&#x2019;s efficient there like she&#x2019;s efficient everywhere. Nothing she cooks takes long&#x2014;leeks are washed and cut in seconds, then set to braise in olive oil and garlic; potatoes are put on to boil; cheese comes out of the fridge. Edith loves good bread and while she might not take time to go to the market for vegetables, she&#x2019;ll drive miles for a great loaf. She loves dessert and whips up a chestnut and honey cake in five minutes, or a thick chocolate sauce, which she&#x2019;ll pour over homemade ice cream, or a fruit tart made from the figs off her prolific tree.<br><br> Her meals are all impromptu and very simple, whether she&#x2019;s cooking for herself at noon on any old day or has ten people coming for dinner. For a dinner party, she&#x2019;ll just multiply that warm potato and herring salad, preceding it with nothing more than some delicious cured sausage, fresh walnuts (from her tree), and perhaps a chickpea or avocado pur�e; she might decide to splurge and grill perfect little lamb chops, which she&#x2019;ll cook in the fireplace; these she&#x2019;ll serve with buttery tender green beans or saut�ed leeks. If she doesn&#x2019;t want to eat meat she won&#x2019;t serve it and will, instead, offer an extra-ample cheese selection and call it good. Her meals are direct and no frills, like her. And because she&#x2019;s an artist, while guests might be surprised, they allow her this peccadillo.<br><br>Most of Edith&#x2019;s dishes are based on memories from her austere grandmother Juliette&#x2019;s farm, where she spent many a summer and school holiday. I swear, there isn&#x2019;t a flavor or food memory she&#x2019;s forgotten. If she&#x2019;s making braised endive, she&#x2019;ll tell the story of how her grandmother forced her, at age twelve, to sit in front of a plate of braised endive every meal for three days until she ate it. (This is a true story. Then, she hated endive; now, miraculously, she loves it.) When she bites into a butter cookie, it reminds her of those the housekeeper made with fresh top cream when she was a girl; when&nbsp;she makes chocolate sauce with water, it&#x2019;s because her aunt at the farm did it that way.<br><br> Edith wasn&#x2019;t &nbsp;surrounded by a lot of warmth and affection when she was growing up, so food became the vehicle for emotion. She is much like her grandmother, somewhat austere to those who don&#x2019;t know her. Yet eat at her table and you&#x2019;ll feel as though you&#x2019;re wrapped in a down comforter. Food, for her, is memory and warmth all wrapped up together.</p><h2>The Raven (Skeleton Creek)</h2><p>Part text, part video, all spine-tingling mystery.Patrick Carman&#39;s Skeleton Creek returns to thrill.Strange things happen in Skeleton Creek - and when they do, Ryan writes them down and Sarah captures them on video.

Her voice weathered countless shifts in public taste, and new reincarnations of her continue to arrive, most recently in the form of singers like Amy Winehouse and Adele.<br><br>Most of the writing on Holiday has focused on the tragic details of her life&#x2014;her prostitution at the age of fourteen, her heroin addiction and alcoholism, her series of abusive relationships&#x2014;or tried to correct the many fabrications of her autobiography.

A physician, Tess Gerritsen lives in Maine.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Chapter One<br><br> They looked like the perfect family.<br><br> This was what the boy thought as he stood beside his father&#x2019;s open grave, as he listened to the hired minister read platitudes from the Bible. Only a small group had gathered on that warm and buggy June day to mourn the passing of Montague Saul, no more than a dozen people, many of whom the boy had just met. For the past six months, he had been away at boarding school, and today he was seeing some of these people for the very first time. Most of them did not interest him in the least.<br><br> But his uncle&#x2019;s family&#x2014;they interested him very much. They were worth studying.<br><br> Dr. Peter Saul looked very much like his dead brother Montague, slender and cerebral in owlish glasses, brown hair thinning toward inevitable baldness. His wife, Amy, had a round, sweet face, and she kept darting anxious looks at her fifteen-year-old nephew, as though aching to wrap her arms around him and smother him with a hug. Their son, Teddy, was ten years old, all skinny arms and legs. A little clone of Peter Saul, right down to the same owlish glasses.<br><br> Finally, there was the daughter, Lily. Sixteen years old.<br><br> Tendrils of her hair had come loose from the ponytail and now clung to her face in the heat. She looked uncomfortable in her black dress, and she kept shifting coltishly back and forth, as though preparing to bolt. As though she&#x2019;d rather be anywhere than in this cemetery, waving away buzzing insects.<br><br> They look so normal, so average, the boy thought. So different from me. Then Lily&#x2019;s gaze suddenly met his, and he felt a tremor of surprise. Of mutual recognition. In that instant, he could almost feel her gaze penetrating the darkest fissures of his brain, examining all the secret places that no one else had ever seen. That he&#x2019;d never allowed them to see.<br><br> Disquieted, he looked away. Focused, instead, on the other people standing around the grave: His father&#x2019;s housekeeper. The attorney. The two next-door neighbors. Mere acquaintances who were here out of a sense of propriety, not affection. They knew Montague Saul only as the quiet scholar who&#x2019;d recently returned from Cyprus, who spent his days fussing over books and maps and little pieces of pottery. They did not really know the man. Just as they did not really know his son.<br><br> At last the service ended, and the gathering moved toward the boy, like an amoeba preparing to engulf him in sympathy, to tell him how sorry they were that he&#x2019;d lost his father. And so soon after moving to the United States.<br><br> &#x201c;At least you have family here to help you,&#x201d; said the minister.<br><br> Family? Yes, I suppose these people are my family, the boy thought, as little Teddy shyly approached, urged forward by his mother.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be my brother now,&#x201d; said Teddy.<br><br> &#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mom has your room all ready for you. It&#x2019;s right next to mine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m staying here. In my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br><br> Bewildered, Teddy looked at his mother. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming home with us?&#x201d;<br><br> Amy Saul quickly said, &#x201c;You really can&#x2019;t live all by yourself, dear. You&#x2019;re only fifteen. Maybe you&#x2019;ll like it so much in Purity, you&#x2019;ll want to stay with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My school&#x2019;s in Connecticut.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but the school year&#x2019;s over now. In September, if you want to return to your boarding school, of course you can. But for the summer, you&#x2019;ll come home with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be alone here. My mother will come for me.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a long silence. Amy and Peter looked at each other, and the boy could guess what they were thinking. His mother abandoned him ages ago.<br><br> &#x201c;She is coming for me,&#x201d; he insisted.<br><br> Uncle Peter said, gently, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later, son.&#x201d;<br><br> In the night, the boy laid awake in his bed, in his father&#x2019;s town house, listening to the voices of his aunt and uncle murmuring downstairs in the study. The same study where Montague Saul had labored these past months to translate his fragile little scraps of papyrus. The same study where, five days ago, he&#x2019;d had a stroke and collapsed at his desk. Those people should not be in there, among his father&#x2019;s precious things. They were invaders in his house.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy, Peter. He needs a family.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t exactly drag him back to Purity if he doesn&#x2019;t want to come with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re only fifteen, you have no choice in the matter. Adults have to make the decisions.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy rose from bed and slipped out of his room. He crept halfway down the stairs to listen in to the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;And really, how many adults has he known? Your brother didn&#x2019;t exactly qualify. He was so wrapped up in his old mummy linens, he probably never noticed there was a child underfoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair, Amy. My brother was a good man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good, but clueless. I can&#x2019;t imagine what kind of woman would dream of having a child with him. And then she leaves the boy behind for Monty to raise? I don&#x2019;t understand any woman who&#x2019;d do that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty didn&#x2019;t do such a bad job raising him. The boy&#x2019;s getting top marks in school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your measurement for what makes a good father? The fact that the boy gets top marks?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also a poised young man. Look how well he held up at the service.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s numb, Peter. Did you see a single emotion on his face today?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty was like that, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cold-blooded, you mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, intellectual. Logical.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But underneath it all, you know that boy has got to be hurting. It makes me want to cry, how much he needs his mother right now. How he keeps insisting she&#x2019;ll come back for him, when we know she won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never even met the woman! Monty just writes us from Cairo one day, to tell us he has a brand-new son. For all we know, he plucked him up from the reeds, like baby Moses.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy heard the floor creak above him, and he glanced toward the top of the stairs. He was startled to see his cousin Lily staring down at him over the banister. She was watching him, studying him, as if he were some exotic creature she&#x2019;d never before encountered and she was trying to decide if he was dangerous.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said Aunt Amy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re up!&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt and uncle had just come out of the study, and they were standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at him. Looking a little dismayed, too, at the possibility that he had overheard their entire conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you feeling all right, dear?&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Auntie.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so late. Maybe you should go back to bed now?&#x201d;<br><br> But he didn&#x2019;t move. He paused on the stairs for a moment, wondering what it would be like to live with these people. What he might learn from them. It would make the summer interesting, until his mother came for him.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Aunt Amy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About my summer, and where I&#x2019;d like to spend it.&#x201d;<br><br> She instantly assumed the worst. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be too hasty! We have a really nice house, right on the lake, and you&#x2019;d have your own room. At least come for a visit before you decide.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve decided to come stay with you.&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt paused, temporarily stunned. Then her face lit up in a smile, and she hurried up the steps to give him a hug. She smelled like Dove soap and Breck shampoo. So average, so ordinary. Then a grinning Uncle Peter gave him an affectionate clap on the shoulder, his way of welcoming a new son. Their happiness was like a web of spun sugar, drawing him into their universe, where all was love and light and laughter.<br><br> &#x201c;The kids will be so glad you&#x2019;re coming back with us!&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> He glanced toward the top of the stairs, but Lily was no longer there. She had slipped away, unnoticed. I will have to keep my eye on her, he thought. Because already, she&#x2019;s keeping her eye on me.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of our family now,&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> As they walked up the stairs together, she was already telling him her plans for the summer. All the places they&#x2019;d take him, all the special meals they&#x2019;d cook for him when they got back home. She sounded happy, even giddy, like a mother with her brand-new baby.<br><br> Amy Saul had no idea what they were about to bring home with them.</p><h2>Waiting to Be Heard: A Memoir</h2><p><p>Amanda Knox spent four years in a foreign prison for a crime she did not commit, as seen in the Netflix documentary <em>Amanda Knox</em>.</p><p>In the fall of 2007, the 20-year-old college coed left Seattle to study abroad in Italy, but her life was shattered when her roommate was murdered in their apartment.</p><p>After a controversial trial, Amanda was convicted and imprisoned. But in 2011, an appeals court overturned the decision and vacated the murder charge. Free at last, she returned home to the U.S., where she has remained silent, until now.</p><p>Filled with details first recorded in the journals Knox kept while in Italy, Waiting to Be Heard is a remarkable story of innocence, resilience, and courage, and of one young woman&#x2019;s hard-fought battle to overcome injustice and win the freedom she deserved.</p><p>With intelligence, grace, and candor, Amanda Knox tells the full story of her harrowing ordeal in Italy&#x2014;a labyrinthine nightmare of crime and punishment, innocence and vindication&#x2014;and of the unwavering support of family and friends who tirelessly worked to help her win her freedom.</p><p><em>Waiting to Be Heard</em> includes 24 pages of color photographs.</p></p><p><p>In November 2007, Amanda Knox was twenty years old and had been studying abroad in Perugia, Italy, for only a few weeks when her friend and roommate, a young English student named Meredith Kercher, was brutally murdered. The investigation made headlines around the world, and Amanda's arrest placed her at the center of a media firestorm. Young, na�ve, grieving at the horrifying death of her friend, and with little more than basic knowledge of the Italian language, she was subjected to harsh interrogations during which she struggled to understand the police and to make her own words understood. The subsequent trial exposed Amanda to international scrutiny and speculation, and she became a tabloid staple. In 2009, after an extremely controversial trial, she was wrongly convicted of murder. But in October 2011, after Amanda had spent four years in an Italian prison, and following a lengthy appeals process, the conviction was overturned. Amanda immediately flew home to the United States.</p><p>Now, in <em>Waiting to Be Heard</em>, Amanda Knox shares for the very first time the truth about her terrifying ordeal. Drawing from journals she kept and letters she wrote during her incarceration, Amanda gives an unflinching and deeply personal account of her harrowing experience, from the devastation of her friend's murder to the series of mistakes and misunderstandings that led to her arrest. She speaks intimately about what it was like, at the age of twenty, to find herself imprisoned in a foreign country for a crime she did not commit and demonized by the international media, and about the impact on her family and loved ones as they traveled back and forth to be at her side so that she would not be alone. She describes the relationships that bloomed with those who believed in her innocence and how the strength of her family helped her survive the most challenging time of her young life. With grace and gratitude, Amanda describes the aftermath of the trial and her return home to the States, where she is able once again to look forward to the future.</p><p>A young woman's soul-baring account of a nightmare turned real, of unimaginable horror and the miscarriage of justice that ensued, and, ultimately, of fortitude in the face of overwhelming adversity, <em>Waiting to Be Heard</em> is a memoir unlike any you have ever read.</p><p>Amanda Knox is an exoneree and a writer in Seattle, Washington. She was wrongfully convicted of murder in Perugia, Italy, in 2009. In 2011 the conviction was overturned, and she was affirmatively found innocent of the charge of murder. In March 2013, the Italian Court of Cassation annulled the acquittal and ordered a new review of the case. Then in March 2015 Italy&#x2019;s high court overturned the previous convictions and ruled she was innocent. She now lives in Seattle, her hometown. She is committed to helping others who have been wrongfully convicted.</p></p><h2>Luck Runs Out</h2><p>The president of Balaclava Agricultural College enlists the help of Professor Peter Shandy when Miss Flackley, the farrier, is found dead in the pen of a prize sow and half a million dollars worth of silver is discovered stolen from the local silversmith</p><p><p>Charlotte MacLeod (1922-2005) was an internationally bestselling author of cozy mysteries.

But he is soon caught up in a marvelous adventure-the building of a new locomotive, the first Berkshire, one of the most powerful and efficient ever.<br><br>The apprentice meets engineer Will Woodard, who explains the dilemmas and niceties of locomotive design. In the pattern shop, Ben see Woodard's blueprints turned into finely-crafted wooden pattern for castings of iron and steel. From Marko Ukropina, an "old country" foundryman, Ben learns the secrets of pouring the massive frames (and to be more careful around white-hot steel). He follows the rough castings to the machine shop, where they are planed smooth and true. In the forge, Ben joins a team of hammermen wrestling a glowing steel ingot under the ground-shaking steam hammer three stories tall-and realizes why only the biggest and brawniest men work here.<br><br>Superpower chronicles the building of a steam locomotive in meticulous detail. But there is more here-it is also the story of working men, many of them immigrants from all over Europe. It recalls a time when family members worked together, and when pride in craftsmanship was intrinsic to American life. Based on oral histories of Lima's workers and their families, Superpower is, most of all, a story of America at work.</p><p>Grade 6 Up A colossal (13 11) book in more ways than one, Superpower depicts the construction of the new ``Berkshire'' steam locomotive through the eyes and experiences of 18-year-old Ben, who begins work with his father at the Locomotive works (the Loco) in mid-1920s Lima, Ohio. In addition to explaining the construction of the new, immense locomotive, Weitzman also conveys the era's sense of community, tradition, and pride in craftsmanship. In the fictional account of his first months at the Loco, Ben learns about the design of locomotives, and during his time as a ``helper'' visits several different parts of the Loco, observing and assisting in the work of the foundry, the forge, the machine shop, and the boiler shop. Ben learns how and why different parts are manufactured by the different processes, until, near the end, he helps in the assembly of the locomotive (in seven days) and sees it come to life for its first trip. Weitzman's work is reminiscent of that of David Macaulay in its methodical exposition of each step of the Berkshire's construction and its excellent, intricately detailed, although not as plentiful, illustrations. It is unfortunate that this excellent work is marred by Weitzman's depiction of the speech of the ethnic laborers. Although an attempt to convey the spirit of the numerous immigrant workers, this distorted English may be construed as stereotyping, while the spelling and sentence structures used to portray these accents will deter less-skilled readers. A lot of research and love for the subject went into Superpower; it is a shame that it is tarnished by this easily avoided flaw. Jeffrey A.

The table of contents contains 47 broad sewing areas, including instruction for applique, bindings, buttonholes, collars, facings, linings, pleats, pockets, shoulderpads, and zippers. Each of these areas is subdivided, i.e., under the "pocket" can be found details on creating mock flaps, mock welts, patch pockets, side seam pockets, side slant pockets, and welt pockets. The editors' goal was to illustrate these techniques so clearly that professional results could be achieved by all home sewers. Since the step-by-step illustrations focus on technique and not on today's fashion, this title has an enduring quality. The sole concern is dressmaking, however, so patrons will have to go elsewhere for instructions on creating home decorating items such as curtains, slipcovers, etc. This bible of dressmaking techniques will appeal to both the novice and experienced home seamstress and belongs in all public libraries.<br><i>- Judith Yankielun Lind, Roseland Free P.L., N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>CORE CONNECTIONS Integrated II</h2><p>The principles of CPM course design &#34; problem-based lessons, collaborative student work, and spaced practice&#34; are based on the methodological research for teaching mathematics that leads to conceptual understanding.</p><p></p><h2>Facing The Lion</h2><p>Facing The Lion is an inspiring autobiographical account of a young, non-Jewish girl standing up for her beliefs in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform to the Nazi propaganda machines.

His attention is caught by a woman "with hair so gossamer-pale you could see the moon through it," wearing a fur coat, boarding his bus in front of a pub called the Stargazey. Her behavior intrigues him, as she leaves, reboards, and leaves the bus again. Jury follows her to the gates of Fulham Palace--but only to the gates. There he stops. Later he wonders if the death in the walled garden of Fulham Palace could have been averted if he had gone in...<br><br>nd if this precipitated still another death in a London club named Boring's, which is Melrose Plant's crusty old men's club. Before Jury and Plant work out the connection between these killings, they are both helped and hindered by Martha Grimes' usual band of eccentrics: Theo Wrenn Browne, trying to shut down the Long Pidd library; the Cripps family trying to shut down civilization; and Diane Demorney, the new horoscope columnist for the Sidbury Star, trying to shut down the heavens.<br></p><p>It all starts with two unlikely passengers on the same number 14 Fulham Road bus--Scotland Yard superintendent Richard Jury and a glamorous blonde woman in a sable coat. He can't keep his eyes off her, and when she disembarks, Jury follows her to the gates of Fulham Palace. He loses her in the fog, however, and when she's found shot to death in the herb garden of the palace, the game's afoot--especially since the victim may only look like Jury's blonde, but not be her at all. Two glamorous women in priceless fur coats in an obscure little museum in the London suburbs on the same foggy autumn night? Well, maybe. Or maybe not. The plot ultimately involves chicanery in the art world, a family of Russian �migr�s, a missing Chagall, an international female assassin, a couple of unsettlingly strange young girls, and a hilarious send up of a stuffy English men's club. The tale serves a hearty helping of Grimes's usual interesting, not to say eccentric, characters. Among the most consistently fascinating of these is Jury's aristocratic friend Melrose Plant, a direct descendant of Lord Peter Wimsey and other wealthy, titled, amateur English detectives. Fans of Grimes's previous Superintendent Jury capers--each of which takes its name from an English pub--will enjoy the jokes, and new readers will appreciate the author's dry wit, her sharp eye for British oddities, and the way she turns an ordinary police procedural into a cozy little study of the national character. The Jury series began with <i>The Man with a Load of Mischief</i> (1981) and has included <i>The Deer Leap</i> (1985), <i>The Horse You Came In On</i> (1993), <i>The Case Has Altered</i> (1997), and several other tales. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Martha Grimes is the author of sixteen novels, fourteen of them Richard Jury mysteries, the most recent being <i>The Case Has Altered</i> (Holt, 0-8050-5620-3), a<i> New York Times </i>Notable Book of 1997.

Reprint.</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Parker, author of the Spenser novels, has made this "sequel to Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep " a stunning, drop-dead success. Private eye Philip Marlowe spins a yarn of greed, madness and death with the cool-eyed cynicism (and good-guy core) that made him the classic hardboiled dick. The era is post-WW II ("GI mortgages"), possibly early '50s ("cha cha cha"), the L.A. dream beginning to sour. Psychotic Carmen Sternwood is missing from an expensive sanatorium. After sultry Vivian has enlisted suave gangster Eddie Mars to locate her sister, the family butler, Norris, hires Marlowe for the same purpose. Sanatorium head Dr. Bonsentir stonewalls Marlowe's queries by using some heavy political clout, but further probing leads to a kinky billionaire who is practically untouchable. Marlowe is beaten up, a chopped-up body is found and an ex-inmate of the asylum dies "accidentally" before the PI uncovers a water-rights scam involving millions. Parker's effort goes beyond pastiche: he uses flashbacks from The Big Sleep daringly and seamlessly, and his terse style (a cop asks for the time of death: "Any idea when yet?") is flawlessly in Chandler's footsteps. This is dazzling. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NIGHT STONE</h2><p>A old house in Maine that was a haven for evil...It gave Beth the creeps.

Elsewhere in London, Septimus Smith is suffering from shell-shock and on the brink of madness. Their days interweave and their lives converge as the party reaches its glittering climax. Here, Virginia Woolf perfected the interior monologue and the novel&#39;s lyricism and accessibility have made it one of her most popular works.</p><p>As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a fine June morning, a sky-writing plane captures her attention. Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness. <p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p> <p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>Tiaras - A History of Splendour</h2><p>Tiaras have always inspired a great fascination and the most beautiful and influential women have been painted, photographed and admired whilst wearing them. Even in the twenty-first century they are still worn and continue to inspire special poise and elegance. This lavishly illustrated book includes new photographs of a variety of Royal tiaras together with those of French and Russian Imperial provenances. Geoffrey Munn has been granted special access to the photographic archives of many famous jewellers, including Cartier, Boucheron and Faberg,, for his research. Other makers include Castellani, Fouquet, Garrards, Giuliano, Lalique, and Tiffany. Among the contemporary pieces illustrated are tiaras belonging to Jamie Lee Curtis, Vivienne Westwood, Elton John and Madonna, made by Slim Barratt, Galliano and Versace.</p><p>Geoffrey Munn is the Managing Director of Wartski Ltd, a firm of antique dealers in London specialising in European precious metalwork. He is co-author of Pre-Raphaelite to Arts and Crafts Jewellery and author of both Castellani and Giuliano - Revivalist Jewellers of the 19th Century and The Triumph of Love - Jewellery 1530-1930. He is also the jewellery specialist on the BBC&#39;s Antiques Roadshow.&#34;...lavish and beautifully illustrated new study...[Geoffrey Munn&#39;s] text is perfectly balanced between sober art and historical chops (as when discussing three tiaras designed by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria) and giddy appreciation (discussing a tiara made for drag comedienne Dame Edna Everage&#34; Publishers Weekly</p><h2>An Affair of the Mind</h2><p>Laurie Hall&#39;s story reveals pornography&#39;s subversive side and offers comfort, encouragement, insight, and a plan of action to women whose husbands are addicted.</p><p>Mixing personal testimony with systematic critique is a staple of hortative religious literature, and Hall's book is a superior example of the type. She has spent years struggling with her husband's addiction to pornography, and for those who doubt that sexual obsessions can have effects like those of substance abuse on individual behavior and interpersonal relations, she lays out the dismayingly credible particulars of her troubled marriage in evidence. First deepening her Christian faith (abandoning herself to Christ, she says), she made prayer, reading the Bible, and learning about sexual addiction and the psychological dynamics of pornography and how to address them the everyday tactics in her battle to preserve her marriage and protect her children. Trusting the Lord and practicing Christian forgiveness (a quality she tellingly dissects) have been the foundations of her overall strategy. She urges women in similar circumstances to follow her--or, rather, Christ's--lead. Meanwhile, she makes a case against pornography that, although rooted in Christian teaching about sexuality, even nonbelievers may find intuitively compelling. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Kenny&#39;s Window (Reading Rainbow)</h2><p>Kenny dreams of a fabulous land where he would like to live always, and in his search for it discovers many things about himself and about growing up. &#x2018;An unusual, imaginative story . . . in which reality blends with make-believe.&#x2019; &#x2014;SLJ. <p> 1956 Children's Spring Book Festival Honor Book (NY Herald Tribune)</p></p><p><p>In addition to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>, Maurice Sendak's books include <em>Kenny's Window</em>, <em>Very Far Away</em>, <em>The Sign on Rosie's Door</em>, <em>Nutshell Library</em> (consisting of <em>Chicken Soup with Rice</em>, <em>Alligators All Around</em>, <em>One Was Johnny</em>, and <em>Pierre</em>), <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life</em>, <em>In the Night Kitchen</em>, <em>Outside Over There</em>, <em>We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy</em>, and <em>Bumble-Ardy</em>.</p><p>He received the 1964 Caldecott Medal for <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>; the 1970 Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration; the 1983 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, given by the American Library Association in recognition of his entire body of work; and a 1996 National Medal of Arts in recognition of his contribution to the arts in America.

Kennedy</h2><p>Nearly forty years have passed since Ruth Hyde Paine, a Quaker housewife in suburban Dallas, offered shelter and assistance to a young man named Lee Harvey Oswald and his Russian wife, Marina. For nine months in 1963, Mrs. Paine was so deeply involved in the Oswalds&#x2019; lives that she eventually became one of the Warren Com-<br>mission&#x2019;s most important witnesses.<br><br><i>Mrs. Paine&#x2019;s Garage</i> is the tragic story of a well-intentioned woman who found Oswald the job that put him six floors above Dealey Plaza&#x2014;into which, on November 22, he fired a rifle he&#x2019;d kept hidden inside Mrs. Paine&#x2019;s house. But this is also a tale of survival and resiliency: the story of a devout, open-hearted woman who weathered a whirlwind of investigation, suspicion, and betrayal, and who refused to allow her enmeshment in the calamity of that November to crush her own life. <br><br>Thomas Mallon gives us a disturbing account of generosity and secrets, of suppressed memories and tragic might-have-beens, of coincidences more eerie than conspiracy theory. His book is unlike any other work that has been published on the murder of President Kennedy.</p><p>Ruth Paine befriended Marina Oswald and found Marina's husband, Lee Harvey, a job in the Texas State Book Depository. Thomas Mallon's <i>Mrs. Paine's Garage</i>revisits the brief intersection of these three lives--what he calls a "collision of innocent intentions and unforeseen enormities." Mallon details the nine-month Paine/Oswald friendship and its rapid post-assassination disintegration. He then sketches Paine's life since (from her testimony before various congressional committees to her current low-profile residence in Florida) and summarizes Paine's place in the churning, obsessive world of conspiracy theorists with snippets of humor. (Former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison is "Elmer Gantry with subpoena power.") This extended footnote to a footnote to a tragedy, though losing focus and energy by its end, is brisk, revelatory and even-handed. It also handily dispels several seemingly ominous coincidences about the events of November 22, 1963. <i>--H.

Reprint.</p><p><blockquote><i> A gentleman was strolling down a side street in Paris, on his way back from the house of one Madame de Verchoureux. He walked mincingly, for the red heels of his shoes were very high. A long purple cloak, rose-lined, hung from his shoulders and was allowed to fall carelessly back from his dress, revealing a full-skirted coat of purple satin, heavily laced with gold; a waistcoat of flowered silk; faultless small clothes; and a lavish sprinkling of jewels on his cravat and breast. </i></blockquote> The gentleman in question is Justin Alastair, the Duke of Avon, known by friends and enemies alike as Satanas--the devil. On this particular evening, the dangerous rake crosses paths with L�on, a red-headed youth of low birth who is fleeing a certain beating at his brutal brother's hands. On a whim, Avon buys the boy and makes him his page. It soon becomes clear, however, that L�on is not what he seems, and that Avon has an ulterior motive for bringing him into his household. Set in pre-Revolutionary France, <i>These Old Shades</i> follows a twisting course as young L�on (or is it L�onie?) is swept up in a dangerous mystery: how to account for the page's amazing resemblance to the sinister Compte de Saint Vire, for example; and why will this man go to any lengths to get the youth in his power? <p> Georgette Heyer's historical romances tend to fall into two different camps: later novels such as <i>Cotillion</i>, <i>False Colours</i>, and <i>Sylvester</i> feature larger-than-life comic characters and romantic pairings more akin to Beatrice and Benedick than Hero and Claudio. Earlier works such as <i>These Old Shades</i>, however, tend to be darker, tinged with mystery and overshadowed by very real menace. What both types share is Heyer's fine storytelling and encyclopedic knowledge of Regency mores and manners--her books are the next best thing to a time machine. <i>These Old Shades</i>'s greatest asset, however, is the charming L�onie: beautiful, brave, and loyal to a fault, with a fondness for swordplay and pistols and a delightfully incomplete grasp of the English language. Heyer herself was so fond of this character that she featured her in two more novels, <i>Devil's Cub</i> and <i>An Infamous Army</i>. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Last Kids on Earth by Max Brallier</h2><p>It&#39;s been forty-two days since the monster apocalypse hit town and pretty much everyone ran away or got zombified.

O.J. Simpson</h2><p>An eye-opening, behind-the-scenes look at the &#34;crime of the century&#34; and the legal proceedings that followed sheds new light on the arrest and trial of O. J. Simpson, the evidence in the case, and the role of the prosecution and defense. 100,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Just when you thought everyone and their second-cousin had published a book on the most famous criminal proceding of the century, along comes a book about the trial that actually deserves to be read. <p> Jeffrey Toobin's coverage of the trial of O.J. Simpson for <b>The New Yorker</b> magazine was the first to focus on the reality that no one wanted to addresss directly, but that pervaded every moment of the trial and perhaps even the crime itself - that race was at the heart of everything. Toobin's explosive article in July 1994, "An Incendiary Defense," laid out the defense lawyers' strategy, fingered Mark Fuhrman as their chief villain, and made the "race card" the euphemism of choice. </p><p> In <b>The Run of His Life</b>, Toobin's reporting, based on his unprecedented access to sources to the sources on all sides, lets us see, in a fresh light, the prosecutors, defense attorneys, private eyes, waiters, dog walkers, cops, ex-football stars, TV personalities, forensic experts, and so many others. He also offers an insightful examination of the larger questions raised by the case - including the importance of celebrity, race (and the way it's manipulated in the media), California as both a state and a state of mind, domestic violence, American jurisprudence, and the efficacy of the jury system.</p>It has been the most closely-watched and controversial legal proceeding of our time, and Jeffrey Toobin has written the definite history of what has become the trial of the century. Here is the whole story of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and their aftermath, as it has never been told -- rich in character, driven by the nonstop plot of a legal thriller, and nuanced by the foibles, vanities, and idiosyncrasies of its participants. Featuring a new chapter on the O.J. Simpson civil trial, <i>The Run of His Life</i> -- hailed by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> as "the pick of the litter" -- is a breathtakingly paced narrative that will long outlast the daily headlines.</p><h2>The Dry Fly: New Angles</h2><p>A brilliant and innovative book by the author of <i>Caddisflies</i>. <br></p><p>The author of <i>Caddisflies</i> and <i>Trout Flies: Proven Patterns</i> presents his vast knowledge about catching trout on dry flies in <i>The Dry Fly: New Angles</i>, an advanced resource for the serious fly-fisher. Combining years of fishing and tying experience with keen observation and lucid prose, LaFontaine organizes his information into several theories about trout behavioral patterns and fishing strategy. He starts with three basic schools of dry fly-fishing: empiricism, generalism, and naturalism. The empiricist relies on remembering which flies worked on certain rivers, regardless of the hatch; the generalist relies on presentation of a few favorite flies, also regardless of the hatch; and the naturalist tries above all to match the hatch with exact imitations. LaFontaine shows why each of these schools is flawed. Basing his ideas on close laboratory study and underwater diving, he argues that a knowledge of primary and secondary strike-triggering characteristics is paramount to catching fish--a school of thought that, in certain conditions, will exaggerate an imitative trait on a fly to attractor-like effect. Beneath all this is the science of when to use imitators and when to use attractors, when to float a fly high on the surface and when to float it low, like an emerger. <p> If you're tired of reaching for the same flies time after time, despite obviously different river conditions or feeding behavior, read <i>The Dry Fly</i>.</p>The Dry Fly is as wonderful as it is unique - it's a book for every serious fly fisherman. It takes the reader on an exciting roller coaster ride, teaching him how to choose the right dry fly or emerger for every trout stream situation. This great work is going to be read over and over, sometimes for the amazing information on attraction and imitation and sometimes for the sheer enjoyment of the writing.The angler will learn more about trout, more about flies, and more about everyday fishing situations in The Dry Fly than in any other fly-fishing book he's ever read. But that's only one part of the guarantee - the other part is that he'll also have more fun reading this irreverent, brilliant treatise on dry-fly fishing than he's ever had with a fishing book before.

In front of the water, the driver saw two men in uniform standing next to a fire barrel, compact assault rifles slung over their shoulders, hands hovering above the barrel to ward off the chill. He slowed instinctively. The passenger said, &#x201c;Keep going. Don&#x2019;t give them any reason to suspect anything.&#x201d;</p><p>The driver huffed slightly, strangely giddy at the turn his life had taken.</p><p>Suspect? Right. I&#x2019;m sure they won&#x2019;t wonder why an American in a business suit is traveling with an Arab wearing ratty jeans. Or why I&#x2019;m sweating like a whore in church in the middle of winter.</p><p>The American continued at reduced speed, using the melted snow on the roadway as an excuse, doing whatever he could to slow the inevitable showdown. The Arab said, &#x201c;Easy. Very, very easy. You get us through this, and you&#x2019;re free. Remember that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay. What do you want me to say? Should I tell them who I am?&#x201d;</p><p>The American prayed the man with the gun would say yes, because he was sure there was a massive manhunt for him involving security agencies from at least two countries.</p><p>The Arab said, &#x201c;No. Of course not. We are tourists like everyone else coming down this road.&#x201d;</p><p>The Arab caught the disappointment on the driver&#x2019;s face and smiled. &#x201c;Remember, only one of us inside this vehicle is afraid to die.&#x201d;</p><p>The American nodded, wiping the sweat off his upper lip. He pulled into the checkpoint and lowered the window. One officer approached while the other began a sweep of the undercarriage with a mirror on a shaft. The American gave a nervous smile and waited.</p><p>The policeman said something in Norwegian. The American said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. English?&#x201d;</p><p>With a heavy accent, the policeman said, &#x201c;Business here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just visiting. We wanted to see the fortifications of the old town. Maybe go to the museum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. But the museum is closed.&#x201d;</p><p>The American knew that. What was going on in the museum was the primary reason the man to his right held a gun. He felt nauseous and overwhelmed. Beads of perspiration rolled down his face despite the freezing air, a direct result of being squeezed between two armed men, one using subterfuge and the other standing out in the cold precisely to penetrate the charade. He had nothing to do with either, but that would matter little when the bullets began to fly.</p><p>He stammered, &#x201c;C-can we just see the old town, then? Surely the square isn&#x2019;t closed.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer studied him for a moment, then said, &#x201c;Car registration, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The American felt the panic blossom. He had no idea if the vehicle even had valid registration, or where it would be stored. But the Arab did. Right hand held low, hiding the pistol, he used his left to dig through the glove box, pulling out a leatherette envelope and passing it through the window.</p><p>The policeman took it, saying to the American, &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>He wiped his upper lip again and said, &#x201c;Yes, fine. A bit of a cold, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>The policeman said nothing, studying the forms inside the envelope. Still looking down, he said, &#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d;</p><p>The American knew whatever he said, it wouldn&#x2019;t match the forms the policeman held. The Arab knew it as well. The American stammered for an answer and caught movement in his peripheral vision. His brain recognized the nightmare a millisecond before the pistol went off right next to his face, the explosion consuming the inside of the vehicle, splitting his eardrums apart.</p><p>The policeman&#x2019;s head snapped back, blood sprouting out and the body crumpling. The American screamed, crouching down and covering his head. The Arab turned to find the other policeman. He was outside the passenger window, frantically attempting to bring his rifle to bear, the mirror dropped to his feet. The Arab fired through the window, shattering the glass and hitting the policeman in the chest, the bullet sending up a small puff of goose-down from his jacket, belying the destruction wrought beneath.</p><p>The policeman whirled in a half circle, then fell to the ground, crawling towards a ditch and clawing at the rifle on his back. The Arab exited the vehicle and stalked over to him, putting a boot into his back, pinning him in place. He yanked the man&#x2019;s head up by the hair, placed the barrel against the back of his skull and pulled the trigger, a plug of gore exiting the man&#x2019;s open mouth and staining the snow underneath.</p><p>The American sagged into his seat, the absolute violence destroying any vestige he might have had for self-defense. The Arab calmly returned to the car, walking around to the driver&#x2019;s side. He said, &#x201c;Get in the passenger seat.&#x201d;</p><p>The American did so, numb. The Arab slid behind the wheel and rolled up the window. He locked the doors, then began digging beneath the driver&#x2019;s seat. He pulled out a small box the size of a cigarette package, a thin wire snaking back under the seat.</p><p>He flipped a switch on the box and a small light turned green. The American said, &#x201c;What is that thing?&#x201d;</p><p>The Arab bared his teeth and said, &#x201c;Your ticket to paradise.&#x201d;</p><p>He put the Rover into gear and drove across the small moat, entering the ancient fortress.</p><p>For all of his fear and naivet�, the American was not a stupid man. He knew what the little container represented. The Arab&#x2019;s intentions had become painfully clear. This isn&#x2019;t a hostage situation. They never wanted me.</p><p>He was riding in a homemade cruise missile. A mobile bomb directed by a thinking, breathing human being. And he was going to die. None of the power from his position would alter that.</p><p>The vehicle made a left turn as soon as it crossed the moat, the Arab with one hand on the wheel and one holding the weapon aimed at the American. As if he could do anything now. He was close to catatonic, rocking forward and back in the passenger seat. Begging for a miracle.</p><p>The vehicle picked up speed, racing down the asphalt lane, the brick and stone buildings from centuries ago a blur outside the window. The American heard the Arab curse and opened his eyes. He saw the Arab staring into the rearview mirror. The American rotated around and caught a man on a motorcycle right behind them. A rider on a BMW, closing in on the bumper, no helmet, long hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>A man the American thought he recognized, but that would be impossible. Even so, he began to hope.</p><p>The driver began chanting in Arabic, stoically reciting something over and over. A brick wall appeared outside of the passenger window, protection for a courtyard built long ago. The museum.</p><p>They reached the end of the lane and the Arab whipped the Range Rover around the turn, tracking the brick wall. The American saw the entrance to the museum about two hundred meters ahead, a milling of men in suits walking to cars parked outside.</p><p>And another BMW motorcycle headed right towards them.</p><p>The bike raced by the entrance, security men shouting as it passed, brandishing weapons way too late.</p><p>The motorcycle grew larger, playing an insane game of chicken. To their left was an ancient berm, to the right the brick wall of the museum. There was no way to avoid each other. The Arab dropped the weapon and put both hands on the wheel, then floored the accelerator. The American screamed, jamming his foot against a non-existent brake pedal in the passenger well.</p><p>The motorcycle kept coming, the rider also without a helmet, his jaw clenched and teeth bared.</p><p>And the American recognized him as well, but couldn&#x2019;t believe it. There was no way that man was here.</p><p>They closed within fifty feet and the biker yanked his handlebars, diving off as the motorcycle went into a slide, the gravel spraying as it sliced into the ground.</p><p>The Arab screamed, jerking the wheel and slamming the vehicle into the berm. The world tumbled into a kaleidoscope of images. Sky, tearing metal, ground, shattered glass. The American slammed into the door, then the roof, coming to rest upside down on the seat of the Range Rover, the vehicle sliding to a stop on the passenger side. He heard nothing but the ticking of the engine.</p><p>The Arab to his right began to stir, slowly rising up and searching for the box, and the American realized he had seconds to alter his destiny. He slapped his hands on the man&#x2019;s wrist, and the Arab punched him straight in the mouth, knocking him back. He rose up, the siren call of self-preservation pushing him forward, and he heard multiple cracks, the Arab&#x2019;s face popping open as if someone had driven in fishhooks and then ripped them out.</p><p>The Arab toppled over in the seat, the box held in his hands.</p><p>The American sat still for a moment, stunned, the steam rising from the engine, one wheel still grinding as it rotated freely. He looked out the windshield and saw his savior. The man from the rear motorcycle, a huge grin on his face and holding a smoking gun.</p><p>The American sagged into the seat, unbelieving. After two hours of hell, he was alive. He floundered in the seat for a second, getting his feet underneath him, then began the climb out of the driver&#x2019;s door above him, a smile plastered on his face. He jerked the door handle, finding it unable to open, but the window through it was shattered and clear. He clawed his way past the body of the Arab, struggling to escape through the sliver of daylight, hearing shouting from the front.</p><p>He looked forward through the stars in the windshield and saw his savior screaming at him to stop. Confused, he simply grinned, and continued on. The man shouted again, now frantically waving his arms. He paused, wondering what was causing the concern. He looked down, and saw his foot on the small cigarette box. An innocuous thing, held in the hand of the dead Arab. He lifted his foot, and the box fell out, a long, long drop to the other side of the vehicle.</p><p>The last thing his mortal life experienced was a flash of light. No heat, although his body was consumed in fire a millisecond later.</p></p><h2>Deadhouse Gates</h2><p>In the vast dominion of Seven Cities, in the Holy Desert Raraku, the seer Sha&#x2019;ik and her followers prepare for the long-prophesied uprising known as the Whirlwind.

Ace has appeared on scores of television shows, including CBS This Morning, NBC Nightly News, CNN, Good Morning America, MSNBC, and Entertainment Tonight.</p>Collins serves up some little-known holiday history in this interesting book that teems with Christmas facts and legends, arranged alphabetically by topic. Readers will be fascinated to learn, for example, that the holiday shopping season used to be only a couple of weeks long, but was extended during WWII so families could get care packages off to soldiers in a timely fashion. Or that St. Francis of Assisi was one of the first people to use a live nativity scene to teach others about Christ's birth. Collins tackles customs such as Christmas gifts and cards, and the popularity of cultural events like the Nutcracker and the Messiah (which, intriguingly, fell entirely out of fashion in the decades after Handel's death). There are chapters on the history of holly, mistletoe, Christmas trees, candy canes, poinsettias, yule logs, stockings and-of course - Santa Claus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In the Kennedy Style</h2><p>"The atmosphere crackled with excitement as JFK and his beautiful lady presided over the receiving line. Jack and Jackie actually shimmered....They were truly the golden couple...." --William Styron<br>The Kennedy White House years are becoming ever-more recognized as a legendary time. This book re-creates the most memorable evenings of that storied era--from the outdoor dinner at Mount Vernon to the Pablo Casals gala--with guest lists, menus, recipes, china, table settings, anecdotes from those who attended, and more. Edited by Letitia Baldrige, Jacqueline Kennedy's Social Secretary during the White House years, <i>In the Kennedy Style</i> is an uniquely personal and intimate tribute.<br>The pages of this elegant gift book are strikingly designed to combine text, quotes, photographs, anecdotes, guest lists, recipes and menus in a highly evocative way. Featured are six of the most remarkable social occasions from the Kennedy era: the outdoor dinner at Mount Vernon, the Pablo Casals gala, the Andr� Malraux dinner, the Nobel Prize winners evening, dinner for the Grand Duchess and Prince of Luxembourg, and dinner for the Shah of Iran. In addition to photographs, recollections, and memorabilia are menus with recipes, allowing readers to re-create some of the atmosphere of those unforgettable evenings.</p><p>Letitia Baldrige&#39;s dedication reads, &#34;For all those who have heard about the grace and charm of the Kennedy White House and wondered, was it really that extraordinary? The answer is &#39;Yes.&#39;&#34; The vibrant couple who moved into the White House in January 1961 were unlike anything that venerable home had ever seen. They were young, attractive, and cosmopolitan, and they were intent on putting their own indelible stamp on American culture. During the next three years, John and Jacqueline Kennedy wrote an entirely new chapter in the annals of presidential entertaining. Baldrige, Jackie&#39;s social secretary, and Ren� Verdon, the White House chef, worked with them behind the scenes to bring off state dinners that are still talked about today (like the famous &#34;Nobel Laureate Dinner&#34;). Alas, the Kennedy days are over, but Baldrige and Verdon bring back the memories in this marvelous book, which pairs Baldrige&#39;s fun, gossipy recollections of each star-studded social occasion with Verdon&#39;s sophisticated pre-nouvelle cuisine menus (including recipes simple enough for today&#39;s home cook). It&#39;s the photographs of the glittering guests, Jackie&#39;s ravishing gowns and perfect collarbone, and Kennedy--tan and handsome in black tie--that invoke the most wistfulness for that &#34;one brief shining moment&#34; that for some represented the pinnacle of American cultural history. After all the dirt, this book is like a long drink of cool water. ENDWritten in an informal style, this memoir that Baldridge and Verdon have collaborated on draws from the heady years they spent in the Kennedy White House. That time seems so far away, a time when the country seemed full of a new promise; and it is that sense that Baldridge captures in the chapters of this engaging book. With reproductions of menus, formal invitations, and plenty of photographs, evenings that are now a part of our nation's history are presented in intimate detail. Each chapter takes on a particular event--the entertaining of a world figure, from Princess Grace to AndreMalraux; but there are few glimpses behind the veneer of power. The recipes are detailed, and in these delicious creations, Verdon shows why he has earned all his honors. At a time when so much has been published about what was wrong with the Kennedy White House, it is refreshing to be reminded of something that was very right about those tragically few years. <i>Raul Nino</i></p><h2>The Fantastic Flying Journey</h2><p>Great-Uncle Lancelot, redoubtable explorer and enthusiastic naturalist, takes his niece and twin nephews on an extraordinary journey around the world, introducing them to a wide variety of animals.</p><p>Gerald Durrell was born in India in 1925. His family settled on Corfu when Durrell was a boy and he spent his time studying its wildlife. He relates these experiences in the trilogy beginning with My Family and Other Animals, and continuing with Birds, Beasts and Relatives and The Garden of the Gods. In his books he writes with wry humour and great perception about both the humans and the animals he meets. <p>On leaving Corfu he returned to England to work on the staff of Whipsnade Park as a student keeper. His adventures there are told with characteristic energy in Beasts in My Belfry. A few years later, Durrell began organising his own animal-collecting expeditions. The first, to the Cameroons, was followed by expeditions to Paraguay, Argentina and Sierra Leone. He recounts these experiences in a number of books, including The Drunken Forest. Durrell also visited many countries while shooting various television series, including An Amateur Naturalist. </p><p>In 1958 Gerald Durrell realised a lifelong dream when he set up the Jersey Zoological Park, followed a few years later by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. </p><p>Rosy is My Relative, his first novel, was published in 1968. Whether in a factual account of an expedition or a work of non-fiction, Gerald Durrell's style is exuberant, passionate and acutely observed. Gerald Durrell died in 1995.</p>British naturalist Gerald Durrell has crammed too much ecology and not enough narrative tension into this fantastic adventure involving visits with a number of endangered species. A skilled professional, Nigel Lambert does his best to breathe life into the story, but he doesn&#39;t have much to work with. Consequently, his performance sounds strained, and many character voices seem affected. Early school-age children may find this acceptable, and adults may be tempted for its educational value, but we can do better. J.N.

While Thomas works on a case involving a murdered woman whose body has been dismembered and left in packages around the city, Charlotte's brother-in-law George is poisoned at the home of his cousin's family on Cardington Crescent. George had been suffering an infatuation for his cousin's wife Sybilla, and the family would like to squelch the suggestion of scandal by leaving the crime unsolved, allowing their circle to believe the poison was administered by his wife Emily Charlotte's sister in a fit of jealousy. Charlotte arrives at Cardington Crescent to clear Emily's name and while she's there, Sybilla is also murdered, strangled with her own long, lovely hair. Thomas and Charlotte work at the mysteries, each cutting through layers of class structure to arrive at the same sordid point, where incest and child neglect intersect. Perry brings the era to life not just by period detail, but with sure-handed characterization and compelling, timeless plot. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Masters of the Wild: A Guidebook to Barbarians, Druids, and Rangers (Dungeon &amp; Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying Accessory)</h2><p>These Forces of Nature Can Weather Any Storm<br><br>Barbarians, druids, and rangers are the rugged and noble champions of untamed lands.

Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film contains all of Deren's essays on her own films as well as more general essays on film theory, the relation of film to dance, various technical aspects of film production, the distinction between amateur and professional filmmaking, and the famous 1946 chapbook titled "An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film," which has been reset here for the first time. There are hard-to-find articles written for magazines and art journals, as well as lectures, Q&amp;A sessions, program notes, and manifestoes. This book will be particularly welcomed by the large audience that saw Martina Kudlacek's documentary, "In the Mirror of Maya Deren," during its theatrical release in the U.S. and Europe in 2002. The importance of Maya Deren's films and writings is further evidenced by the American Film Institute having named its highest award for independent filmmaking the "Maya Deren."</p><p>Maya Deren&#39;s life is the subject of a multi-volume biography in progress (see: The Legend of Maya Deren). Born in Kiev in 1917, Maya Deren emigrated to the United States with her parents a few years later, grew up mainly in Syracuse, New York, and attended Syracuse University. A social activist from her teens, she became interested first in dance and subsequently in filmmaking. Throughout the 1950s, until her premature death in 1961 at the age of 44, Maya Deren was a leading exponent of experimental cinema and considered one of its most influential artists. She first traveled to Haiti to film dances in 1947, and returned in following years for lengthy stays. The work in Haiti led to the classic ethnographic study, Divine Horsemen, written with the encouragement of Joseph Campbell, as well as audio recordings and a documentary film which was later edited by Teiji and Cherel Ito. A two-hour documentary on Maya Deren and her work was produced for BBC television in 1987. Martina Kudlacek&#39;s 2002 documentary, &#34;In the Mirror of Maya Deren,&#34; received a theatrical release and widespread critical acclaim. Deren&#39;s own films have been released on DVD as &#34;Experimental Films&#34; and &#34;Divine Horsemen&#34; from Mystic Fire Video.Maya Deren was the first of a distinguished succession of filmmaker-theoreticians of the American avant-garde cinema... -- <i>P.

M. White, B. N. Morris, and others perfected the art of the wood-and-canvas canoe, then takes us step by step through the construction of an E. M. White-designed 18-footer. Fold-out plans are included. Detailed information is also provided on canoe repair, restoration, and maintenance. Jerry Stelmok builds new E. M. White designs and adaptations at Island Falls Canoe, and Rollin Thurlow builds, repairs, and restores canoes at his Northwoods Canoe Shop.</p><p>Jerry Stelmok is a Tilbury House Publishers author.Authors of both books are traditional wooden boat builders in Maine. Alvord describes well-made small wooden hunting and fishing craft that have a permanent place in Eastern boating. Focusing on historical preservation and identification of trends rather than on boatbuilding, he begins with a good chapter on "Boat Basics," which includes a concise glossary and a few good clear diagrams illustrating the terms. He surveys the Native American birch-bark canoe, Eastern fishing guideboats, Maine lobster boats, duck boats, and Chesapeake Bay watercraft. For most craft, there are a detailed line drawing and an interesting anecdote. This will not supplant Howard Chapelle's American Small Sailing Craft (1951), but it is enjoyable and has a nice recommended reading list. Stelmok and Thurlow are boatbuilders writing for boatbuilders. They offer some good history and a fine description of canoe building, but there is a great deal of technical talk. The first part is a third-person narrative describing how a modern-day canoe maker builds a traditional birch-bark canoe. It details a trip to the forest, selecting and gathering materials, and what tools to use. The rest of the book is a step-by-step guide by Stelmok to the repair and restoration of a turn-of-the-century wood and canvas canoe. We get a good idea of the rhythm of boatbuilding as it was in the early 1900s. This thorough, well-written book should be highly prized by canoe builders, but it is not for every library.

It is his classical mastery, his ressourcement, that enables the Cardinal to build a bridge.</p><p>Cardinal Ratzinger seeks to deepen our understanding of the Bible's most fundamental principle. The covenant defines religion for Christians and Jews. We cannot discern God's design or his will if we do not meditate upon his covenant.</p><p>The covenant, then, is the principle that unites the New Testament with the Old, the Scriptures with Tradition, and each of the various branches of theology with all the others.

Gardner&#39;s version restores the poetry of the text and the lyricism that is lost in the earlier, almost scientific renderings. The principal theme of the poem is a familiar one: man&#39;s persistent and hopeless quest for immortality. It tells of the heroic exploits of an ancient ruler of the walled city of Uruk named Gilgamesh. Included in its story is an account of the Flood that predates the Biblical version by centuries. Gilgamesh and his companion, a wild man of the woods named Enkidu, fight monsters and demonic powers in search of honor and lasting fame. When Enkidu is put to death by the vengeful goddess Ishtar, Gilgamesh travels to the underworld to find an answer to his grief and confront the question of mortality.</p><p><p>"[Gilgamesh] has never been better served than in this new translation...Maier's contribution is the meticulous scholarship that envelopes the book...John Gardner's contribution...is the translation itself: lyrical, sinewy, emotionally uncompromising and rhythmically brilliant."</p><p>-- William L.

They were there to see a marvel of the age: the steamship <i>St. Louis,</i> one of the largest ocean liners in the world and America&#x2019;s brand-new entry into the transatlantic passenger trade. When the gates opened, people surged toward the ship. She was 550 feet long and decorated from stem to stern with flags of the world, with the American Stars and Stripes flying high above the bow.1<br> <br>The owner of the new ship, Philadelphia businessman Clement Griscom, was on his way to the shipyard with the christening party, headed by the bulky U.S. president, Grover Cleveland and the elegant, much younger first lady, Frances Cleveland. A chuffing Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive pulled the presidential train right up to the Cramp Shipyard gates. Stepping out, the first lady took Griscom&#x2019;s arm, and the group of dignitaries walked to the launching platform, joined along the way by shipyard owner Charles H. Cramp.<br> <br>Among those watching the scene was the forty-eight-year-old William Warren Gibbs, a crafty, aggressive financier who was said to sit on more boards of directors than any other man in America. On this blustery fall day, he had brought his two young sons&#x2014;eight-year-old William Francis and six-year-old Frederic&#x2014;to watch the launch of the great liner.<br> <br>Self-made William Warren Gibbs was one of Philadelphia&#x2019;s most daring entrepreneurs. His physical appearance matched his temperament: he was lean, with fierce, defiant eyes, and a dark, pointed beard. A farm boy from the small town of Hope, New Jersey, he had arrived in the city thirty years before with little more than a skill for persuasion, but went on to become a multimillionaire laying gas lines and selling electric batteries. The United Gas Improvement and Electric Storage Battery companies had also enriched many of the city&#x2019;s leading citizens. When he brought his sons to see the launch of <i>St. Louis,</i> he was rumored to be worth $15 million, a stupendous pile of money in 1894.1 His sometime partner in the gas business was a well-connected member of an old Philadelphia family: <i>St. Louis</i>&#x2019;s owner Clement Griscom, president of the International Navigation Company, a shipping firm he founded with the help of the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad.<br> <br>William Warren Gibbs might have looked at ships with an eye for profit. But for his eight-year-old son William Francis, seeing a great ship was pure poetry. During summer days at the family&#x2019;s summer home on the New Jersey shore, the boy scanned the horizon for funnels, masts, and black smudges of coal smoke, and then sketched what he saw. He knew that as he looked north, ocean liners, growing bigger and faster every year, were sailing in and out of the great port city of New York. Little Willy yearned for a closer look at one of these ocean greyhounds.<br> <br>And now, at his father&#x2019;s side, he had his chance&#x2014;<i>St. Louis</i> was a liner of vigorous beauty, her graceful hull draped with red, white, and blue bunting.<br> <br>The shipyard was also a marvel to behold. William Cramp &amp; Sons had been building cargo ships, passenger liners, and warships for over sixty years. The proud standard bearer for Philadelphia&#x2019;s industrial might, Cramps employed more than five thousand workers, many of them immigrants from Ireland and Italy.2 In the yard was a towering crane, perched atop a floating barge, that could pick up a seventy-ton boiler and deftly swing it into the hull of a ship over three hundred feet away. Muscular riveters put hulls together by hammering red-hot rivets into steel and iron plates. Roaring orange fires glowed from forges where men shaped mammoth pistons, propellers, and funnels with the precision of watchmakers.<br> <br>As the music from the band faded into silence, the little boy and the crowd around him awaited the launching of the great ship. Mounting the platform, Cramp handed the first lady a bottle of champagne. The hydraulic rams then hit the ship a bit too early, and the hull started to creep down the ways. Startled, the first lady called out, &#x201c;I christen thee <i>St. Louis</i>!&#x201d; and smacked the bottle across the prow before it slid out of reach.3 Picking up speed, the ship roared down the tallow-greased slipway toward the Delaware River, kicking up billows of acrid smoke and, upon hitting the water, sending waves smashing against the banks. Once fully in the river, heavy chains slowed her to a stop. Tugboat crews secured their lines, and she was towed to the fitting-out basin. Her sister ship, <i>St. Paul,</i> remained on an adjacent slipway, to be christened in April of the following year.<br> <br>At a luncheon after the launch, frock-coated dignitaries toasted the glory of the new American flagship and the presumed rebirth of the nation&#x2019;s preeminence on the North Atlantic. The American merchant marine&#x2014;before the Civil War a vast fleet of clippers, whaling ships, and sailing packets&#x2014;had been in steady decline for decades. An American steamship had not held the transatlantic speed record for half a century. The culprits were lack of government support, a shortage of private capital, and cheaper, subsidized foreign competition.<br> <br>But to President Cleveland and Clement Griscom, <i>St. Louis</i> represented the dawn of a new era of American maritime might. &#x201c;We may well be proud because we have launched the largest and most powerful steamship in the Western hemisphere,&#x201d; the president declared, &#x201c;built on American plans, by American mechanics, and of American materials.&#x201d; The two ships would &#x201c;furnish the revival and development of American commerce and the renewed appearance of the American flag in foreign ports.&#x201d;4<br> <br>To little William Francis Gibbs, the launching of the new ship on that drizzly November day marked the start of a lifelong love affair. He would grow up to build a ship much bigger, faster, and grander than the magnificent <i>St. Louis.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;That was my first view of a great ship and from that day forward I dedicated my life to ships,&#x201d; William Francis Gibbs later recalled. &#x201c;I have never regretted it.&#x201d;5<br> <br>The size, beauty, and luxury of the nineteenth-century ocean liner captivated the public, but even more alluring was speed. &#x201c;Speed is the only thing which they talk, think, or dream of anywhere between Sandy Hook and Roche&#x2019;s Point,&#x201d; the <i>New York Times</i> said about American passengers in 1883. &#x201c;Whenever their vessel distances some other steamship which is bound in the same direction, they are thrown into ecstasies.&#x201d;6 Shipbuilders were just as obsessed with speed. &#x201c;Each successive lowering of the record,&#x201d; boasted Philadelphia&#x2019;s Cramp Shipyard, &#x201c;marks a triumph for the designer and builder, a fame world-wide, and substantial benefits to mankind.&#x201d;7<br> <br>This speed record was known as the &#x201c;Blue Riband of the Atlantic,&#x201d; a mythic-sounding prize developed in the middle of the nineteenth century and awarded to the fastest steamship sailing between the old and new worlds. Because actual miles traveled varied from voyage to voyage, the unspoken rule was to award the Blue Riband not to the ship making the quickest trip, but to the one achieving the highest average speed in nautical miles per hour, or knots (1.15 land miles per hour).2 Prevailing winds and currents made the westbound crossing, from Europe to America, more difficult than the one eastbound. So the Blue Riband was divided into two prizes: one for the westbound record and another for the eastbound; the former, more arduous crossing, carrying more prestige. There was no set course, but the generally accepted rule was that the clock started when the ship left its last port of call and achieved full cruising speed&#x2014;usually off the southwest tip of England&#x2014;and ended at the entrance to New York harbor, either at Sandy Hook or Ambrose Lightship, when she had to slow down. What started as an advertising ploy quickly grew into an international contest into which steamship companies, engineers, and governments poured talent and money.<br> <br>It was the advent of steam that allowed oceangoing passenger ships to keep regular schedules, and the first commercially successful steamship was an America creation. In 1807 Robert Fulton&#x2019;s steamboat <i>Clermont,</i> plying the Hudson River, cut the travel time from New York to Albany from three days down to thirty-two hours, and could make regularly scheduled departures regardless of wind and currents. Twelve years later, an enterprising group of businessmen from Savannah, Georgia, outfitted a small sailing ship with a crude steam engine and paddle wheels and sent her across the Atlantic. <i>Savannah</i>&#x2019;s epic voyage, even if only made partially under steam, was a landmark in maritime history, but American businessmen decided that steamships were best used on inland and coastal routes. The ocean remained the domain of the sailing ships, most notably the clippers, which journeyed around Cape Horn to the gold fields of California and the tea and spice hubs of East Asia.<br> <br>It was a different story for the British, whose fortunes were tied to the overseas wealth generated by its far-flung colonies. For the British government, supporting this new transportation technology&#x2014;steamships that could carry passengers, mail, and cargo on a regular schedule&#x2014;was a matter of imperial necessity. Not only that, but there were fortunes to be made carrying immigrants in steerage to the United States and Canada. In 1839, Samuel Cunard, an enterprising colonial who moved to England from Nova Scotia, finagled a British government subsidy of �60,000 a year to start a transatlantic steamer line that would carry the mails.8 Cunard&#x2019;s first ship, <i>Britannia</i>&#x2014;a two-hundred-foot-long, wooden paddle-wheel steamer with a top speed of 8.5 knots (about 10 land miles per hour)&#x2014;made its first voyage between Liverpool, Halifax, and Boston in July 1840. Service to New York began in 1857. Cunard&#x2019;s ships cut a typical Atlantic crossing time down from two months under sail to a mere two weeks under steam. For Samuel Cunard, safety and reliability trumped luxury. Cabins were cramped, furnishings plain, and cuisine bland at best. As his partner Charles MacIver once made clear to an unhappy passenger, &#x201c;Going to sea is a hardship.&#x201d;9<br> <br>The transition from sail to steam made crossings faster, but not necessarily more pleasant; the North Atlantic was still arguably the most treacherous body of water on the planet. Except for a brief sunny summer interlude, passengers boarding a liner in Liverpool bound for New York expected gray skies, heaving seas, and blustery winds during most of the voyage. During the depths of winter, spitting rain, howling gales, and monster waves would punish the steamship, send furniture and clothing flying through the air, and make everyone on board seasick. And then when the ship reached the Grand Banks, off the Canadian coast, thick fog would often roll in, making visibility close to zero. Most passengers were more than happy to stumble ashore after enduring two weeks of cramped quarters and nausea aboard a Cunard steamer.<br> <br>After a decade of Cunard supremacy on the North Atlantic, one American tried to outdo the British in speed and luxury. During the 1850s, a New Englander named Edward Knight Collins was on the receiving end of a mail subsidy from Washington for steamship service between New York and Liverpool: a princely $385,000 a year. Three of his luxurious ships took the new Blue Riband, making 13 knots and beating the British ships by an average of seven hours.10 But after two of his money-losing ships sank and drowned hundreds of passengers, Congress killed the line&#x2019;s subsidy. Urging the move was Collin&#x2019;s unsubsidized rival in the transatlantic steamship business, a brash New Yorker named Cornelius Vanderbilt, known by the public as &#x201c;the Commodore.&#x201d; The Collins Line collapsed without the subsidy, but Vanderbilt&#x2019;s transatlantic line also failed&#x2014;he sold his ships and purchased the New York Central Railroad. While Washington gave away millions of acres of land out West to the railroads, the American merchant marine got little support.<br> <br>After the Civil War, European companies dominated the transatlantic route. Supported by state mail contracts and construction subsidies, Cunard and its competitors made spectacular profits from carrying immigrants in cramped squalor and wealthy travelers in opulence. In 1871, Thomas Ismay, a cantankerous but shrewd Liverpool businessman, founded the White Star Line in a partnership with the Irish shipbuilder Harland &amp; Wolff. Ismay&#x2019;s company showcased British white-glove service to wealthy Americans, pleasing even the finicky historian Henry Adams, who marveled at how the transatlantic liner represented human progress.11 Another was a haughty, Hartford-born banker named John Pierpont Morgan. The young man was so impressed with the White Star Line that he dreamed of one day buying it.<br> <br>Across the North Sea, two German companies, Norddeutscher Lloyd, based in Bremen, and the Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft, known as HAPAG, captured the lion&#x2019;s share of the immigrant trade. HAPAG in particular profited immensely from transporting &#x201c;huddled masses,&#x201d; many of them Jewish pogrom refugees, from Eastern Europe to America. Packing immigrants into steerage bunks at twenty-five dollars a head translated to spectacular profits. The w�nderkind of the German shipping business was a brilliant, diminutive Jew named Albert Ballin. Appointed HAPAG&#x2019;s managing director in 1899, Ballin was a self-made man who strove to make his ships perfect. When ships like his <i>Kaiserin Auguste Victoria</i> or <i>Amerika</i> were in port, he prowled all over them, making note of the slightest deficiencies in service or appearances. He even hired the Ritz-Carlton company to operate specialty first class restaurants on board.12<br> <br>The heated competition between Great Britain, Germany, and eventually France during the late nineteenth century spurred great technological advances, as lines plowed their vast profits into building bigger and faster ships. Progress was astounding. Liners grew from 3,000 gross tons to 10,000 gross tons, and lengths doubled from 300 feet to nearly 600.3<br> <br>Ship construction moved from wood to iron, auxiliary sails were dropped, and paddle wheels were abandoned for the screw propeller. By the 1880s, first-class passengers could dine and read in public rooms lit by electricity, and enjoy hot and cold running water in their cabins. Engine technology also advanced rapidly. By the 1870s, British engineers had perfected the so-called compound engine. Here steam would pass through a series of three or four cylinders before being ejected into the condenser. So-called triple and quadruple expansion engines allowed for more steam pressure, which meant more speed.13 As a result, travel time between Liverpool and New York was cut from two weeks to just over six days, and top speeds approached 20 knots, double the speed of the first paddle-wheel liners. Ships were now boasting two screw propellers rather than just one.<br> <br>Following the Civil War, a lone American steamship company was left to brave Atlantic waters. Philadelphia&#x2019;s Clement Griscom had attracted the backing of the Pennsylvania Railroad and John D. Rockefeller&#x2019;s Standard Oil Company, which saw a transatlantic service as a means to pick up where railroads ended, at the water&#x2019;s edge. In 1871, Griscom&#x2019;s American Steamship Company commissioned Cramp Shipyard to build four liners to carry passengers, oil, and bulk cargo between Philadelphia and Liverpo...</p><h2>Hokus Pokus (The Sisterhood: Rules of the Game, Book 2)</h2><p>Forced to disappear, the seven members of the Sisterhood, who have taken vigilante justice to a new level, must sneak back into the U.S. to help Supreme Court Chief Justice Pearl Barnes, who is being blackmailed due to her own special brand of justice.

Since seven that morning she had been inhaling the scent of death, an aroma so familiar to her that she did not recoil as her knife sliced cold skin, as foul odors wafted up from exposed organs. The police officers who occasionally stood in the room to observe postmortems were not so stoic. Sometimes Maura caught a whiff of the Vicks ointment that they dabbed in their nostrils to mask the stench. Sometimes even Vicks was not enough, and she&#x2019;d see them suddenly go wobbly and turn away, to gag over the sink. Cops were not accustomed, as she was, to the astringent bite of formalin, the sulfurous aroma of decaying membranes.<br><br>Today, there was an incongruous note of sweetness added to that bouquet of odors: the scent of coconut oil, emanating from the skin of Mrs. Gloria Leder, who now lay on the autopsy table. She was fifty years old, a divorcee with broad hips and heavy breasts and toenails painted a brilliant pink. Deep tan lines marked the edges of the bathing suit she had been wearing when she was found dead beside her apartment swimming pool. It had been a bikini&#x2014;not the most flattering choice for a body sagging with middle age. When was the last time I had the chance to put on my bathing suit? Maura thought, and she felt an absurd flash of envy for Mrs. Gloria Leder, who&#x2019;d spent the last moments of her life enjoying this summer day. It was almost August, and Maura had not yet visited the beach or sat by a swimming pool or even sunbathed in her own backyard.<br><br>&#x201c;Rum and Coke,&#x201d; said the young cop standing at the foot of the table. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s what she had in her glass. It was sitting next to her patio chair.&#x201d;<br><br>This was the first time Maura had seen Officer Buchanan in her morgue. He made her nervous, the way he kept fussing with his paper mask and shifting from foot to foot. The boy looked way too young to be a cop. They were all starting to look too young.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you retain the contents of that glass?&#x201d; she asked Officer Buchanan.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh . . . no, ma&#x2019;am. I took a good whiff. She was definitely drinking a rum and Coke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At nine A.M.?&#x201d; Maura looked across the table at her assistant, Yoshima. As usual, he was silent, but she saw one dark eyebrow tilt up, as eloquent a comment as she would get from Yoshima.<br><br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t get down too much of it,&#x201d; said Officer Buchanan.<br><br>&#x201c;The glass was still pretty full.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Maura. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a look at her back.&#x201d;<br><br>Together, she and Yoshima log-rolled the corpse onto its side.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a tattoo here on the hip,&#x201d; noted Maura. &#x201c;Little blue butterfly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Geez,&#x201d; said Buchanan. &#x201c;A woman her age?&#x201d;<br><br>Maura glanced up. &#x201c;You think fifty&#x2019;s ancient, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s my <i>mom&#x2019;s </i>age.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Careful, boy. I&#x2019;m only ten years younger.<br><br></i>She picked up the knife and began to cut. This was her fifth postmortem of the day, and she made swift work of it. With Dr. Costas on vacation, and a multivehicle accident the night before, the cold room had been crammed with body bags that morning. Even as she&#x2019;d worked her way through the backlog, two more bodies had been delivered to the refrigerator. Those would have to wait until tomorrow. The morgue&#x2019;s clerical staff had already left for the evening, and Yoshima kept looking at the clock, obviously anxious to be on his way home.<br><br>She incised skin, gutted the thorax and abdomen. Removed dripping organs and placed them on the cutting board to be sectioned. Little by little, Gloria Leder revealed her secrets: a fatty liver, the telltale sign of a few too many rums and Cokes. A uterus knobby with fibroids.<br><br>And finally, when they opened the cranium, the reason for her death. Maura saw it as she lifted the brain in her gloved hands. &#x201c;Subarachnoid hemorrhage,&#x201d; she said, and glanced up at Buchanan. He was looking far paler than when he had first walked into the room. &#x201c;This woman probably had a berry aneurysm&#x2014;a weak spot in one of the arteries at the base of the brain. Hypertension would have exacerbated it.&#x201d;<br><br>Buchanan swallowed, his gaze focused on the flap of loose skin that had been Gloria Leder&#x2019;s scalp, now peeled forward over the face. That&#x2019;s the part that usually horrified them, the point at which so many of them winced or turned away&#x2014;when the face collapses like a tired rubber mask.<br><br>&#x201c;So . . . you&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;s a natural death?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br><br>&#x201c;Correct. There&#x2019;s nothing more you need to see here.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man was already stripping off his gown as he retreated from the table. &#x201c;I think I need some fresh air . . .&#x201d;<br><br>So do I, thought Maura. It&#x2019;s a summer night, my garden needs watering, and I have not been outside all day.<br><br>But an hour later she was still in the building, sitting at her desk reviewing lab slips and dictated reports. Though she had changed out of her scrub suit, the smell of the morgue still seemed to cling to her, a scent that no amount of soap and water could eradicate, because the memory itself was what lingered. She picked up the Dictaphone and began to record her report on Gloria Leder.<br><br>&#x201c;Fifty-year-old white woman found slumped in a patio chair near her apartment swimming pool. She is a well-developed, wellnourished woman with no visible trauma. External exam reveals an old surgical scar on her abdomen, probably from an appendectomy. There is a small tattoo of a butterfly on her . . .&#x201d; She paused, picturing the tattoo. Was it on the left or the right hip? God, I&#x2019;m so tired, she thought. I can&#x2019;t remember. What a trivial detail. It made no difference to her conclusions, but she hated being inaccurate.<br><br>She rose from her chair and walked the deserted hallway to the stairwell, where her footfalls echoed on concrete steps. Pushing into the lab, she turned on the lights and saw that Yoshima had left the room in pristine condition as usual, the tables wiped down and gleaming, the floors mopped clean. She crossed to the cold room and pulled open the heavy locker door. Wisps of cold mist curled out. She took in a reflexive breath of air, as though about to plunge into foul water, and stepped into the locker.<br><br>Eight gurneys were occupied; most were awaiting pickup by funeral homes. Moving down the row, she checked the tags until she found Gloria Leder&#x2019;s. She unzipped the bag, slipped her hands under the corpse&#x2019;s buttocks and rolled her sideways just far enough to catch a glimpse of the tattoo.<br><br>It was on the left hip.<br><br>She closed the bag again and was just about to swing the door shut when she froze. Turning, she stared into the cold room.<br><br><i>Did I just hear something?<br><br></i>The fan came on, blowing icy air from the vents. Yes, that&#x2019;s all it was, she thought. The fan. Or the refrigerator compressor. Or water cycling in the pipes. It was time to go home. She was so tired, she was starting to imagine things.<br><br>Again she turned to leave.<br><br>Again she froze. Turning, she stared at the row of body bags. Her heart was thumping so hard now, all she could hear was the beat of her own pulse.<br><br><i>Something moved in here. I&#x2019;m sure of it.<br><br></i>She unzipped the first bag and stared down at a man whose chest had been sutured closed. Already autopsied, she thought. Definitely dead.<br><br><i>Which one? Which one made the noise?<br><br></i>She yanked open the next bag, and confronted a bruised face, a shattered skull. <i>Dead.<br><br></i>With shaking hands she unzipped the third bag. The plastic parted, and she saw the face of a pale young woman with black hair and cyanotic lips. Opening the bag all the way, she exposed a wet blouse, the fabric clinging to white flesh, the skin glistening with chilly droplets of water. She peeled open the blouse and saw full breasts, a slim waist. The torso was still intact, not yet incised by the pathologist&#x2019;s knife. The fingers and toes were purple, the arms marbled with blue.<br><br>She pressed her fingers to the woman&#x2019;s neck and felt icy skin. Bending close to the lips, she waited for the whisper of a breath, the faintest puff of air against her cheek.<br><br>The corpse opened its eyes.<br><br>Maura gasped and lurched backward. She collided with the gurney behind her, and almost fell as the wheels rolled away. She scrambled back to her feet and saw that the woman&#x2019;s eyes were still open, but unfocused. Blue-tinged lips formed soundless words.<br><br><i>Get her out of the refrigerator! Get her warm!<br><br></i>Maura shoved the gurney toward the door but it didn&#x2019;t budge; in her panic she&#x2019;d forgotten to unlock the wheels. She stamped down on the release lever and pushed again. This time it rolled, rattling out of the cold room into the warmer loading area.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eyes had drifted shut again. Leaning close, Maura could feel no air moving past the lips. <i>Oh Jesus. I can&#x2019;t lose you now.<br><br></i>She knew nothing about this stranger&#x2014;not her name, nor her medical history. This woman could be teeming with viruses, yet she sealed her mouth over the woman&#x2019;s, and almost gagged at the taste of chilled flesh. She delivered three deep breaths, and pressed her fingers to the neck to check for a carotid pulse.<br><br><i>Am I imagining it? Is that my own pulse I feel, throbbing in my fingers?<br><br></i>She grabbed the wall phone and dialed 911.<br><br>&#x201c;Emergency operator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is Dr. Isles in the medical examiner&#x2019;s office. I need an ambulance. There&#x2019;s a woman here, in respiratory arrest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, did you say the medical examiner&#x2019;s office?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes! I&#x2019;m at the rear of the building, just inside the loading bay. We&#x2019;re on Albany Street, right across from the medical center!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m dispatching an ambulance now.&#x201d;<br><br>Maura hung up. Once again, she quelled her disgust as she pressed her lips to the woman&#x2019;s. Three more quick breaths, then her fingers were back on the carotid.<br><br>A pulse. There was definitely a pulse!<br><br>Suddenly she heard a wheeze, a cough. The woman was moving air now, mucus rattling in her throat.<br><br><i>Stay with me. Breathe, lady. Breathe!<br><br></i>A loud whoop announced the arrival of the ambulance. She shoved open the rear doors and stood squinting against flashing lights as the vehicle backed up to the dock. Two EMTs jumped out, hauling their kits.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in here!&#x201d; Maura called.<br><br>&#x201c;Still in respiratory arrest?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, she&#x2019;s breathing now. And I can feel a pulse.&#x201d;<br><br>The two men trotted into the building and halted, staring at the woman on the gurney. &#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; one of them murmured. &#x201c;Is that a <i>body </i>bag?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I found her in the cold room,&#x201d; said Maura. &#x201c;By now, she&#x2019;s probably hypothermic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, man. If this isn&#x2019;t your worst nightmare.&#x201d;<br><br>Out came the oxygen mask and IV lines. They slapped on EKG leads. On the monitor, a slow sinus rhythm blipped like a lazy cartoonist&#x2019;s pen. The woman had a heartbeat and she was breathing, yet she still looked dead.<br><br>Looping a tourniquet around one flaccid arm, the EMT asked: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s her story? How did she get here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything about her,&#x201d; said Maura. &#x201c;I came down to check on another body in the cold room and I heard this one moving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does this, uh, happen very often here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is a first time for me.&#x201d; And she hoped to God it was the last.<br><br>&#x201c;How long has she been in your refrigerator?&#x201d;<br><br>Maura glanced at the hanging clipboard, where the day&#x2019;s deliveries were recorded, and saw that a Jane Doe had arrived at the morgue around noon. <i>Eight hours ago. Eight hours zipped in a shroud. What if she&#x2019;d ended up on my table? What if I had sliced into her chest? </i>Rummaging through the receiving in-basket, she found the envelope containing the woman&#x2019;s paperwork. &#x201c;Weymouth Fire and Rescue brought her in,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;An apparent drowning . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa, Nelly!&#x201d; The EMT had just stabbed an IV needle into a vein and the patient suddenly jerked to life, her torso bucking on the gurney. The IV site magically puffed blue as the punctured vein hemorrhaged into the skin.<br><br>&#x201c;Shit, lost the site. Help me hold her down!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Man, this gal&#x2019;s gonna get up and walk away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s really fighting now. I can&#x2019;t get the IV started.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s just get her on the stretcher and move her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you taking her?&#x201d; Maura said.<br><br>&#x201c;Right across the street. The ER. If you have any paperwork they&#x2019;ll want a copy.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you there.&#x201d;<br><br>* * *<br><br>A long line of patients stood waiting to register at the ER window, and the triage nurse behind the desk refused to meet Maura&#x2019;s attempts to catch her eye. On this busy night, it would take a severed limb and spurting blood to justify cutting to the front of the line, but Maura ignored the nasty looks of other patients and pushed straight to the window. She rapped on the glass.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to wait your turn,&#x201d; the triage nurse said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Isles. I have a patient&#x2019;s transfer papers. The doctor will want them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which patient?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The woman they just brought in from across the street.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean that lady from the morgue?&#x201d;<br><br>Maura paused, suddenly aware that the other patients in line could hear every word. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; was all she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on through, then. They want to talk to you. They&#x2019;re having trouble with her.&#x201d;<br><br>The door lock buzzed open, and Maura pushed through, into the treatment area. She saw immediately what the triage nurse had meant by <i>trouble. </i>Jane Doe had not yet been moved into a treatment room, but was still lying in the hallway, her body now draped with a heating blanket. The two EMTs and a nurse struggled to control her.<br><br>&#x201c;Tighten that strap!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shit&#x2014;her hand&#x2019;s out again&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forget the oxygen mask. She doesn&#x2019;t need it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watch that IV! We&#x2019;re going to lose it!&#x201d;<br><br>Maura lunged toward the stretcher and grabbed the patient&#x2019;s wrist before she could pull out the intravenous catheter. Long black hair lashed Maura&#x2019;s face as the woman tried to twist free. Only twenty minutes ago, this had been a blue-lipped corpse in a body bag. Now they could barely restrain her as life came roaring back into her limbs.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on. Hold on to that arm!&#x201d;<br><br>The sound started deep in the woman&#x2019;s throat. It was the moan of a wounded animal. Then her head tilted back and her cry rose to an unearthly shriek. Not human, thought Maura, as the hairs stood up on the back of her neck. <i>My god, what have I brought back from the dead?<br><br></i>&#x201c;Listen to me. <i>Listen!</i>&#x201d; Maura commanded. She grasped the woman&#x2019;s head in her hands and stared down at a face contorted in panic. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let anything happen to you. I promise. You have to let us help you.&#x201d;<br><br>At the sound of Maura&#x2019;s voice, the woman went still. Blue eyes stared back, the pupils dilated to huge black pools. One of the nurses quietly began to loop a restraint around the woman&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>No, thought Maura. Don&#x2019;t do that.<br><br>As the strap brushed the patient&#x2019;s wrist, she jerked as though scalded. Her arm flew and Maura stumbled backward, her cheek stinging from the blow.<br><br>&#x201c;Assistance!&#x201d; the nurse yelled. &#x201c;Can we get Dr. Cutler out here?&#x201d;<br><br>Maura backed away, face throbbing, as a doctor and another nurse emerged from one of the treatment rooms. The commotion had drawn the attention of patients in the waiting room. Maura saw them eagerly peering through the glass partition, watching a scene that was better than any TV episode of <i>ER.<br><br></i>&#x201c;We know if she has any allergies?&#x201d; the doctor asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No medical history,&#x201d; said the nurse.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here? Why is she out of control?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have no idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Okay, let&#x2019;s try five milligrams of Haldol IV.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;IV&#x2019;s out!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then give it IM. Just do it!

Her daughter Fanny's stories of this busy place are a friendly and funny introduction to the delights of real restaurant life, and her recipes show how easy and inexpensive it is to make good food with basic ingredients and simple techniques. <p> Opening up the magic world of cooking to children, Alice Waters describes, in the words of seven-year-old Fanny, the path food travels from the garden to the kitchen to the table. Teaching kids where food really comes from not just from the market but from farms and people who care about the earth, Fanny at Chez Panisse has lessons on the importance of eating with your hands, of garlic and of composting and recycling. It is also a delightful beginner's cookbook with 46 recipes that will tempt children into the desire to cook and eat with whole hearts, alert minds and all the senses. From banana milkshakes and green apple sherbet to cherry tomato pasta and black beans and sour cream, as well as spaghetti and meatballs, french fries and pizza, there is something here for every child to prepare and enjoy.</p></p><p>Chez Panisse, a restaurant in Berkeley, is the brainchild of renowned chef Alice Waters. Fanny is Alice Waters's daughter and <i>Fanny at Chez Panisse</i> is a collection of 46 recipes that are simple, delicious, and fun to make. The first third of the book tells the story of Fanny's adventures at Chez Panisse and introduces many of the people who work and dine there. There is Bumps, a family friend who lives on a boat and makes special bread; Carrie, the florist who supplies Chez Panisse with its bouquets; and Jean, a customer who prefers to eat in the kitchen rather than the restaurant because "That's where the food and my favorite people are." Through Fanny's eyes, the reader glimpses the inner workings of a quirky, wonderful restaurant and the people who run it. (Fanny says she's not sure who runs Chez Panisse--"I think Chez Panisse runs Chez Panisse.")<p> The rest of the book is taken up with Fanny's favorite recipes divided into sections such as "Carrots, Cucumbers, and Bell Peppers," "Corn," "Garlic," "Fruit," and more. Recipes range from raita to Peach Crisp and Roast Chicken with Herbs, and are easy to follow with some adult supervision. Though <i>Fanny at Chez Panisse</i> is primarily aimed at children, the recipes in it are delicious enough for adults to enjoy as well. And remember, the family that cooks together has a really great meal to show for all that togetherness!</p><p>Alice Waters is the visionary chef and owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California. She is the author of four cookbooks, including <em>Chez Panisse Vegetables</em> and <em>Fanny at Chez Panisse</em>. In <em>1994</em> she founded the Edible schoolyard at Berkeley's Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, a model curriculum that integrates organic gardening into academic classes and into the life of the school; it will soon incorporate a school lunch program in which students will prepare, serve, and share food they grow themselves, augmented by organic dairy products, grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish--all locally and sustainably produced.</p><p>David Lance Goines is a Berkeley printer and designer whose friendship with Alice Waters goes back more than thirty years. His famous posters, including his annual Chez Panisse birthday posters, are in the permanent Collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the Mus�e des Arts D�coratifs at the Louvre in Paris, the Achenbach Foundation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>I&#39;m Too Young for This!: The Natural Hormone Solution to Enjoy Perimenopause</h2><p><b>Why Wait to Feel Good Again?&nbsp;</b><br><br>If you're in your thirties or forties, your body is changing, and so are your moods, sleep, health, and weight.

Cry and you cry with your girlfriends.<br><br>--Laurie Kuslansky<br><br>Today, looking at my granddaughters as they enter puberty I understand from my own life experience that they can't know that the ease of their little girl lives is now going to start becoming complicated. Chemical changes and life itself become very difficult to understand. This is the life cycle. As we enter womanhood we grow breasts, our moods change, our bodies change, the known is now unknown, uncharted new territory.<br><br>Becoming a woman, especially before you are a woman, is a difficult passage at best. There is so much pressure. You may be the first one in your class to get your period, or the last one; both scenarios feel awful. You may be the one with the huge boobs, or the one whose breasts have not grown at all and the boys notice. Again, either way, other kids make fun of you, and you feel mortified.<br><br>I was the last in my class to grow breasts and the last to get my period. I was so embarrassed by this that I pretended I had my period when I really didn't just so I wasn't the one who was "out of the group." I made up stories about my "cramps" like the other girls. There was always some girl in the class who had cramps so bad, real or imagined, that she had to be sent home. I wished so much then that it could be me. (Imagine.)<br><br>One day, the other girls found out I was lying when my mother, who did not know how to tell a lie or be dishonest, told the mother of the most popular girl in the class that she didn't know why I was such a late bloomer.<br><br>The word was out and they all made fun of me. "How could you?" I wailed to my perplexed mother.<br><br>The year before this, the Catholic school I attended started running those scratchy black-and-white films showing sterile pictures of fallopian tubes and talking about "bleeding." Eeewww! I didn't want to know anything about it, at the time, which is pretty funny considering my work now. But I digress. So there I was, the only one in my class without her period and wishing/praying for it!<br><br>It all seems silly now, but so overwhelming when you are a fifteen-year-old.<br><br>Why did I even want the process to begin? I had the freedom of living without hormonal cycles, and the relatively steady physical and emotional balance of that freedom. Yet I did not know to appreciate it. No one told me about the long, drawn-out process I was about to enter; I did not know of the cycles of woman.<br><br>Then it finally came . . . a spot of blood. I was thrilled! "Guess what?" I blurted out to my mother. "I'm bleeding!" She seemed embarrassed, but later that evening without a mention she put a box of Kotex (trade name for humongous sanitary pads) in my room along with this awful-looking strap-thing-y to hold it on to my skinny little body. It felt like I was riding a horse, but I wore it proudly and complained about the discomfort to my girlfriends (for attention) while I prayed for cramps.<br><br>My mother was very Victorian, modest and shy, so she never really talked to me about it. In fact, the entire "sex talk" we had happened one day when I was standing on the kitchen stool putting away some dishes for her on a high shelf. She remarked that I had some hair under my arms (about four strands), and then she whispered, "Oh, do you have it down there also?"<br><br>Down there. That was it; the closest we ever got to talking about my changing body, my transition, my new life. A product of her time, my mother's shame of her own body became my shame, so I kept all things girly and personal to myself.<br><br>I entered womanhood having no idea of what it meant.<br>A Peek Under the Hood<br><br>The female body is miraculous and complex, capable of bringing new life into the world by way of our reproductive organs. But what exactly goes on "down there" and in there? It's important to understand how our bodies work: our exquisite female reproductive system consists of internal and external parts.<br><br>The external parts include the labia majora and the labia minora, also called lips, that surround the vagina and urethra and protect the internal organs from infectious organisms. The internal parts include the vagina, which claims both the functions of enabling sperm to enter the woman's body and being a birth canal. The uterus is the organ that carries a growing fetus, and the cervix is the lower part of the uterus that joins the uterus and the vagina. The ovaries, which rest to either side, produce eggs, and the fallopian tubes allow eggs to travel into the uterus.<br><br>Our bodies are magnificent. Each month we experience apoptosis, a fancy name for the necessary death of cells. We can understand this better by an explanation of our monthly period and what happens in the uterus. Each month we shed the lining of the endometrium (cell death) and it is cleared from our bodies through the process called menstruation. This monthly bleed is a necessary form of cell death to make way for new cells and to remove cells whose DNA has been damaged to the point at which cancerous change is liable to occur. It's a brilliant process, always clearing our bodies monthly to keep us healthy; it is only interrupted if we become pregnant, and in that case the endometrium lining holds the nourishment for the developing fetus.<br><br>If an egg released from the ovaries is fertilized by sperm, and pregnancy occurs, it will travel through the fallopian tube and implant itself in the uterus. During pregnancy, the egg, or embryo, grows into a fetus inside the uterus, which expands in size to accommodate the developing baby. A woman carries the baby in her uterus, or womb, until the baby is ready to be born.<br><br>When a woman's body expels all the eggs produced by the ovaries during the course of her lifetime, menopause begins and the ability to reproduce ends. Menopause should really be called "egglessness." It's a friendlier term. Before we get to eggless, however, our hormones begin to decline subtly, in what we call perimenopause. Meaning you can still reproduce but it will become more difficult to conceive, difficult to carry to full term, and the eggs left are often not as strong and healthy. Sometimes, but not always, this leaves babies born to moms at risk for birth defects and health conditions.<br><br>As fully reproductive women we make enough estrogen each month so that it reaches its peak on the twelfth day, stops the growth of cells, and makes progesterone receptors. Without an estrogen peak, your brain can't send the signal to release any of the eggs you have left. With no estrogen peak there's no feedback information to shut off follicle-stimulating hormone, so FSH pours constantly, overstimulating your ovaries and ripening all at once most of the eggs you have left. The loss of this rhythm in perimenopause actually triggers the destruction of the rest of your eggs through the action of excessive FSH, using up the remainder of your eggs. At about this time, you begin to feel the heat of hot flashes. That's how the system effectively shuts itself down for good. This process can take a decade--a long uncomfortable decade!<br><br>This is all background to explain why the healthiest woman is a reproductive woman, and once hormones begin to decline, new science has proved that replacing the missing hormones restores a woman to her healthiest prime even though she is no longer capable of making a baby.<br><br>What I did know was that now I felt different. I was getting used to the ups and downs of the surges of sex hormones and menstrual cycles, as well as the (very welcome) growth of pubic hair, breasts, and sex feelings. Now I felt that I was like all the other girls.<br><br>But then my breasts kept growing. (Wow, be careful what you wish for!) I started out at fifteen wearing a scant 32A cup (padded), hardly filling it, and by the summer of my sixteenth year I was an overflowing 34C that could hardly be contained. My breasts grew so big and so fast on my skinny little body that they were a little embarrassing, but I liked the attention I was getting from having them, including attention from my lecherous drama teacher who would say highly inappropriate things to me when no one was around. I got the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls partly due to my talent, partly due to my shapely, curvy body, and partly because that lecherous one wanted me around. My father didn't like the new me at all. My body seemed to make him angry, and he would say things like, "For chrissakes, put some clothes on."<br>BYE-BYE PUBERTY<br><br>Transitioning into womanhood, like all transitions, is an agitating and confusing experience. It's a long, bumpy, uncomfortable road; but then you adjust to the excitement, privileges, and challenges of being an adult. This is also a time when your hormones reach their maximum. By the time you are in your twenties and thirties, you enter a period of remarkable high energy, clear thinking, and all the drama of being an adult and building your adult life. You don't quite know who you are yet in most cases, but you sure are having fun. Your body is the best looking it will ever be; your breasts are high and perky, and your sex drive is off the charts. You are oozing estrogen. For most people this is a time of perfect hormonal balance. Diet affects your hormones at this time like any time, but your youth withstands the assault of binge drinking, hangovers, fast food, quarts of ice cream, and sugary desserts. Somehow you sleep it off, bang down giant cups of coffee, and sail through work until the end of the next week, when you do it to yourself all over again.<br>HELLO, MIDLIFE . . . <br><br>Sometime between your midthirties and midforties another series of physical changes begins to takes place. Transitions! In general, this is a time of strength and vibrancy, but now you are more affected by outside factors and lifestyle choices. And as I just said, things are shifting again. Your periods may become a little erratic, your breasts may get painfully lumpy, and sometimes your periods get lighter or heavier than usual, or you are bleeding between them. You or your friends may be struggling with: infertility, difficulty conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, sudden weight gain, foggy thinking, memory loss, migraine headaches, cold hands and/or feet, and premenstrual syndrome, even when you've never had it before.<br><br>You are a little moodier than you used to be and you tire more easily. The kids can get on your nerves in ways they never had before. By the end of the day you can't wait for that 5:00 cocktail to cool out and relax. You don't recover from a long trip or a night out as easily, either, and staying home becomes more alluring than constantly running to the next event. You need more sleep, but the sleep you are getting isn't as sound as it once was. Your muscles strain more easily when you are working out, and when you get out of bed in the morning, you might grunt a little from the stiffness. The fast food you enjoyed in your twenties now gives you heartburn, and drink one too many glasses of wine and you will have a whopper of a headache.<br><br>But the big one . . . you don't feel like having sex the way you used to. Is it you? Is it him? You don't know, but it's depressing and it takes its toll around the house.<br><br>Your husband is working as hard as he can to give you the lifestyle you both want. You likely are working two jobs: in your career and at home. You feel "put upon" because he is always gone and you have to do everything. He doesn't seem to realize all you do and that you are working from morning till late at night being the perfect mom, wife, housekeeper, career woman, and preparing for everyone for the next day while he's already asleep under the covers with the TV blaring. You can't help it when you get annoyed that he didn't stay up for you, even though he has an early morning appointment. Could this be PMS? No, you say to yourself. This is real. It's him. You start to have dark thoughts about breaking out, getting away. But these are just fantasies . . . aren't they? Your PMS used to be mild, but now it can carry with it a surge of fury. Plus, you've gained a little weight and you can't seem to exercise enough to get it off. That too is annoying. You ask him if what you're wearing makes you look fat, and if he says yes, it's an evening wrecker.<br><br>What is happening? You are now at midtransition. Fun, huh?<br>HORMONE HELL<br><br>Just like with puberty, now your hormones seem to be all over the place again. Just when you had gotten used to feeling great all the time, it's like something has stripped it away. Your hormones are fluctuating up and down, like they have a mind of their own, but the overall direction of them is down, just as your reproductive years are winding down.<br><br>In puberty your hormones fluctuate, which is why you cry, yell at your mother, get depressed and feel suicidal if your boyfriend breaks up with you. Plus you hate your body and you feel fat, and your parents are mean and no one understands you.<br><br>Then you transition through that passage into your reproductive years and suddenly your cycles are regular. You feel happy and serene, and proud of your abilities to reproduce. And aren't you something that you have given birth to these incredible children? They are perfect and so is your life. Your husband brings you flowers, and you have great standing-up sex in the shower with the door locked, while the kids are still safely sleeping in their rooms. Life is good. Life is smooth sailing and delicious.<br><br>Then along comes perimenopause and the fluctuations start again, almost like you are back in puberty. You cry for no reason, no one understands you, you are overworked and underappreciated, your body is betraying you, and did I mention, no one in the house understands you?</p><h2>Robert Doisneau</h2><p>Robert Doisneau (1912-1994) is best known for his magical, timeless 35mm street portraits taken in Paris and its suburbs. Fresh, unstaged, and full of poetry and humor, his photographs portray everyday people (in everyday places, doing everyday things) frozen in time, unwittingly revealing fleeting personal emotions in a public context. Doisneau&#39;s gift was the ability to seek out and capture, with humanity and grace, those little epiphanies of everyday Parisian life. This book traces Doisneau&#39;s life and career, providing a wonderful introduction to the work of this seminal photographer.</p><p></p><h2>The Enchanted Wanderer: and Other Stories</h2><p><p>The award-winning translators of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Gogol now bring us a Russian writer ripe for rediscovery, whose earthy and exuberant stories, famous in his own country, have never before been adequately translated into English.<br><br> Leskov was Chekhov&#x2019;s favorite writer and was greatly admired by Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky. His short stories&#x2014;innovative in form, richly playful in language, now tragic, now satirical, now wildly comic in subject matter&#x2014;exploded the prevailing traditions of nineteenth-century Russian fiction and paved the way for such famous literary successors as Mikhail Bulgakov. These seventeen stories are visionary and fantastic, and yet always grounded in reality, peopled by outsized characters that include serfs, princes, military officers, Gypsy girls, wayward monks, horse dealers, nomadic Tartars, and, above all, the ubiquitous figure of the garrulous, enthralling, not entirely trustworthy storyteller.<br><br>In stories long considered classics, Leskov takes the speech patterns of oral storytelling and spins them in new and startlingly modern ways, presenting seemingly artless yarns that are in fact highly sophisticated. It is the great gift of this new translation that it allows us to hear the many vibrant voices of Leskov&#x2019;s singular art.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><p>Nikolai Leskov was born in 1831 in the village of Gorokhovo in Russia. He began his writing career as a journalist living in Kiev, and later settled in St. Petersburg, where he published many short stories and novellas, including <i>The Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i> (1865), <i>The Sealed Angel</i> (1873), <i>The Enchanted Wanderer</i> (1873), and <i>Lefty</i> (1882). He died in February 1895.<br> &nbsp;<br> Together, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have translated works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol, Bulgakov, and Pasternak. They were twice awarded the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize (for their versions of Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>Anna Karenina</i>), and their translation of Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>Demons</i> was one of three nominees for the same prize. They are married and live in France.<br></p><i><i>Excerpted from the Introduction<br><br></i><br>Leskov is a writer who yields enormous pleasure, breaking past sectarian literary and ideological premises. But more: we live in a moment of lowered cultural and emotional expectations, after the fall of modernism but with nothing very strong to replace it. To go back to certain earlier writers is to regain a sense of human possibility. To go back to Leskov is to regain a sense of the passion, sometimes the joy, that can be part of the human enterprise.</i><br> &#x2014;Irving Howe, &#x201c;Justice for Leskov&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nikolai Leskov, a younger contemporary of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and one of the great masters of Russian fiction, is a writer who keeps being discovered. The first to discover him was Leskov himself. He was in his late twenties and working as a business agent for his uncle, a Russianized Scotsman named Alexander Scott, whose firm managed the vast estates of two noble Russian families. Leskov later described those years, from 1857 to 1859, as the best period of his life. He traveled all over Russia, &#x201c;from the Black Sea to the White and from Brod to Krasny Yar,&#x201d; and sent back reports in the form of letters to his uncle. &#x201c;I had no need to clear myself a path to the people through books and ready-made ideas,&#x201d; he later wrote. &#x201c;I studied them in place. Books were a precious help to me, but I was the helmsman. Hence I&#x2019;m not rooted in any school, because it was not in school that I learned, but on Scott&#x2019;s barges.&#x201d; These travels gave him a great store of impressions that he drew upon all his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scott was struck by the literary quality of Leskov&#x2019;s reports and used to read them aloud to his neighbors, one of whom praised them so highly that it gave Leskov the idea of becoming a writer. As he commented rather drily in a third-person &#x201c;Note on Himself&#x201d; thirty years later: &#x201c;His writing began by chance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was born in the village of Gorokhovo, near the town of Orel (pronounced &#x201c;Ory�l&#x201d;), in 1831. Orel, located in the Russian heartland, the so-called &#x201c;wooden Russia,&#x201d; some two hundred and twenty miles southwest of Moscow, is the setting of five of the seventeen stories in the present collection. Another is set in Mtsensk, which is in the Orel region, and five more take place in other provincial Russian towns. This preponderance of the provincial is typical of Leskov&#x2019;s work as a whole, though, as the reader will see, he could also tell sophisticated and witty stories set in Petersburg, Moscow, Vienna . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> On his father&#x2019;s side, Leskov came from several generations of priests serving the village of Leski, which gave them their family name. His father, too, received a seminary education, but he broke with tradition and entered government service in the Orel courts, eventually attaining the rank of collegiate assessor, which conferred hereditary nobility. His mother was from an impoverished aristocratic family: her father, a Moscow nobleman who had lost everything during the French invasion in 1812, worked as an estate manager in Gorokhovo; her mother, of whom Leskov gives us a fine portrait in the last chapter of &#x201c;Deathless Golovan,&#x201d; was of Moscow merchant stock and, as Leskov says, &#x201c;was taken in marriage into a noble family &#x2018;not for her wealth, but for her beauty.&#x2019; &#x201d; Leskov thus combined in himself the three estates&#x2014;noble, mercantile, and clerical&#x2014;but in oddly mixed and attenuated forms.<br> &nbsp;<br> He first came to know the fourth estate, the peasants (serfs at that time), in 1839, when his father gave up his position as a magistrate in Orel and bought the small country estate of Panino, in the Kromy district, twenty miles from Orel. This move and some of the experiences it led to are described in the opening chapters of his story &#x201c;The Spook.&#x201d; The knowledge of peasant life he acquired then, later enriched by his travels for Alexander Scott, differed greatly from the abstractions of radical social theory that were becoming fashionable in Moscow and Petersburg.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leskov&#x2019;s formal schooling was limited to the five years, from 1841 to 1846, he spent at the secondary school in Orel. He later wrote that he was &#x201c;terribly bored but studied well,&#x201d; but in fact he was a mediocre student, and at the age of fifteen he left school without finishing and went into civil service as a clerk in the Orel criminal court. In 1848 his father died during an outbreak of cholera, leaving his mother to manage the little estate at Panino and raise seven children, of whom he was the eldest. In 1849 his maternal uncle, Sergei Petrovich Alferiev, a doctor in Kiev and a professor at the university, invited him to visit. Leskov was greatly impressed by the city and decided to stay. He took a leave from his post in Orel and by February of 1850 had been accepted as a junior clerk in the Kiev military recruitment office. This close experience of the workings of Russian bureaucracy and of the fate of conscripts (the term of military service at that time was twenty-five years) would reappear again and again in his writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leskov spent eight years in Kiev, made friends with students and professors at the university through his uncle, sat in on courses, read widely, learned Ukrainian and Polish, and incidentally witnessed the building of the famous Nikolaevsky Chain Bridge over the Dniepr River, designed by the Anglo-Irish engineer Charles Blacker Vignoles. This was the first multi-span suspension bridge in Europe and at the time the longest in the world. The workers and the work on the bridge have a central place in his story &#x201c;The Sealed Angel&#x201d; (1873), and though he deliberately avoids naming the city, the setting is vividly evoked. The directors of the actual project were English, as in Leskov, and Vignoles&#x2019;s letters and papers (which, of course, Leskov never saw) describe the same natural disasters, the floods and ice damage, that play such a major part in the story. In 1853, the year that the bridge was officially opened, Leskov married Olga Smirnova, the daughter of a Kiev merchant.<br> &nbsp;<br> The suffering and the corruption Leskov witnessed daily in the system of military conscription under the emperor Nicholas I were counterbalanced by the intellectual breadth and moral idealism he met with in the people of his uncle&#x2019;s circle. He was profoundly influenced by a number of them, in particular by a man he refers to in an autobiographical note as &#x201c;the well-known statistician-abolitionist Dmitri Petrovich Zhuravsky.&#x201d; Zhuravsky (1810&#x2013;1856) was an economist who not only advocated the abolition of serfdom in theory but also practiced it in reality, buying out house serfs and setting them free. At his death, he left his small inheritance for the continuation of that practice. Writing to his friend the Slavophile publicist Ivan Aksakov on December 2, 1874, Leskov said of Zhuravsky: &#x201c;he was all but the first living person who, in the days of my youth in Kiev, made me understand that virtue exists not only in abstractions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Another of his Kievan acquaintances, and one closer to him in age, had an even stronger influence on the young Leskov. This was Stepan Stepanovich Gromeka (1823&#x2013;1877), a nobleman from Poltava who was attached to the governor-general&#x2019;s staff when they met in 1852. Gromeka had a rather strange career. Politically he began as a liberal, advocating reform rather than revolution. He defended the monarchy while hoping to improve it. In 1857&#x2013;1858 he published a series of satirical articles on the police in the prominent Moscow journal The Russian Messenger. He also contributed to the liberal Petersburg monthly Notes of the Fatherland, and to the radical journal The Bell, edited in London by the expatriate Alexander Herzen. But his journalistic career was confined to some five or six years. By 1862 he had turned against Herzen, and in the later 1860s he went back into government service, ending as governor of Siedlce province in Russian Poland, where he campaigned for the absorption of the Uniate (Eastern Roman Catholic) Church into the Russian Orthodox Church and was notorious for his brutal treatment of peasants who resisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leskov followed a very different path from Gromeka&#x2019;s, but in his &#x201c;Note on Himself&#x201d; he acknowledged that their friendship during his years in Kiev &#x201c;had a decisive influence on Leskov&#x2019;s subsequent destiny. The example of Gromeka, who abandoned his government service and went to work for the Russian Society of Shipping and Trade, induced Leskov to do the same.&#x201d; So it was that Leskov left his position in the recruiting office and went to work for Alexander Scott. But in 1860 Scott&#x2019;s firm suffered reverses and he could no longer keep his nephew employed. Leskov returned to Kiev, and here the influence of Gromeka again proved crucial. Gromeka had preceded Leskov into business; he had also preceded him into journalism. In the early 1860s it was Gromeka who connected Leskov with such prominent Moscow and Petersburg editors as Mikhail Katkov of The Russian Messenger, Stepan Dudyshkin and Andrei Kraevsky of Notes of the Fatherland, Mikhail and Fyodor Dostoevsky of Time and Epoch (&#x201c;The Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&#x201d; was first published in Epoch in 1865). In the same &#x201c;Note on Himself,&#x201d; he confessed that &#x201c;Leskov&#x2019;s decisive enslavement to literature was again the work of that same Gromeka. He has been writing ever since.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leskov&#x2019;s earliest article, &#x201c;Sketches of the Distilling Industry (Penza Province),&#x201d; was published in April 1861 in Notes of the Fatherland. By then the thirty-year-old author had moved to Petersburg himself. It was his first taste of life in the capital, and it was a heady moment for Russian society. In 1855 the repressive emperor Nicholas I had died and his son, Alexander II (1818&#x2013;1881), had taken the throne. In March 1861, Alexander II released a manifesto proclaiming the emancipation of the serfs, for which he became known as the &#x201c;tsar-liberator.&#x201d; In 1864 came a far-reaching judicial reform, for the first time establishing open courts, trial by jury, and a bar association. There were also military reforms shortening the length of service and eliminating corporal punishment, among other things. But this was also the time of the nihilists, the so-called &#x201c;new people,&#x201d; who were not satisfied with Alexander&#x2019;s reforms or with liberalism in general and called for far more radical changes. The term &#x201c;nihilist&#x201d; first entered Russian literature in a novel by another writer from Orel&#x2014;Ivan Turgenev. In his Fathers and Sons, published in 1862, it is applied to Evgeny Bazarov, whom Turgenev conceived as &#x201c;a new type of hero.&#x201d; Arkady Kirsanov, a close friend of Bazarov, explains the meaning of the term to his father: &#x201c;A nihilist is a man who does not bow down before any authority, who does not take any principle on faith, whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in.&#x201d; The radical journalist Dmitri Pisarev (1840&#x2013;1868) put it more bluntly: &#x201c;Whatever can be smashed, must be smashed.&#x201d; It was a time of fierce polemics, clandestine publications, the first experiments with communes, and also of several attempts to assassinate the tsar-liberator, the last of which, in March 1881, was successful.<br> &nbsp;<br> With his move to Petersburg, Leskov was caught up in the contradictions of the time, and as a journalist he quickly found himself embroiled in them. Writing about &#x201c;Leskov&#x2019;s Literary Beginnings,&#x201d; the French scholar Jean-Claude Marcad� observed: &#x201c;Leskov&#x2019;s articles are interesting because they show the same temperament in the publicist as would be that of the writer throughout his career. It was impossible for him to compose accommodating works, to hide the truth as he felt it.&#x201d;* Near the end of his life, in an interview with V. V. Protopopov, Leskov said of himself:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>I love literature as a means enabling me to express what I hold to be true and good. If I cannot do that, literature is of no value to me: looking upon it as art is not my point of view. I absolutely cannot understand the concept of &#x201c;art for art&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; No, art must be useful. Only then does it have a precise meaning. I do not acknowledge the art of painting naked women. It is the same for literature. If one cannot serve the true and the good by means of art, it is useless to write, and one ought to abandon the occupation.*</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a prolific journalist and remained one all his life, producing over six hundred articles in all. But in 1862 he also published his first fiction in The Northern Bee, which, in tune with the times, had turned from a reactionary to a liberal journal.<br> &nbsp;<br> The progressives were divided into two camps, the &#x201c;gradualist&#x201d; and the &#x201c;impatient.&#x201d; Leskov remained with the gradualists, he said, because he found their moderation more trustworthy. Besides, he was somewhat older than most of the &#x201c;new people&#x201d; and had behind him a much deeper and more varied experience of Russian realities. But he had a number of good friends among the &#x201c;impatient,&#x201d; and when student unrest broke out in Petersburg and then in Moscow in 1861&#x2013;62, he sympathized with their cause. From them he arrived at the notion, to be embodied in his polemical novel No Way Out (1864), that there were good nihilists and bad nihilists, and that the good would soon distinguish themselves from the &#x201c;nihilizing babblers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In Moscow, on May 18, 1862, a clandestine proclamation entitled &#x201c;Young Russia&#x201d; appeared, calling upon the radical youth to &#x201c;pick up their axes&#x201d; and &#x201c;strike the imperial party&#x201d; wherever it might be&#x2014;&#x201c;in the public squares . . . the streets, the fields, the villages&#x201d;&#x2014;and with each blow to cry: &#x201c;Long live the social and democratic Republic of Russia!&#x201d; The &#x201c;imperial party&#x201d; meant not only the emperor and his family, but the nobility, the merchants, the functionaries, the landowners&#x2014;they were all to be included in the bloodbath. Copies of the proclamation were handed out in the streets and courtyards, sent by mail, stuffed into coat pockets, distributed in churches, pasted up on walls. It caused great alarm among the inhabitants of both capitals, and all sorts of rumors began to spread. In the midst of that agitation, towards the end of May, a series of fires broke out in Petersburg. The conservatives immediately blamed them on the students and revolutionaries. The progressives countered by saying they had been set by the police as a provocation. (Some also suggested they were simply the work of property owners who wanted to collect on their insurance. To this day, in fact, no one knows whether the fires were deliberate or accidental.) The fire in the Apraksin and Shchukin markets on May 28 caused the greatest panic and destruction. Two days later Leskov published an editorial in The Northern Bee responding to the rumors about arson, noting that &#x201c;the public also points to what sort of people the incendiaries are, and hatred of that sort of people [he carefully avoids mentioning students] is growing with unheard-of speed.&#x201d; He voiced his concern about the danger &#x201c;the members of that body&#x201d; might face as a result of the rumors. He did not presume to judge how well-founded the suspicions were and to what extent they might be connected to &#x201c;the latest abominable and revolting proclamation calling for the overthrow of the entire civil order of our society.&#x201d; But to avoid worse disorders, he called on the police to make public at o...</p><h2>Into the Unknown</h2><p><b>They had all gone on before, and I was standing and pushing at the upstanders of my sledge, when the block of ice I was using as a support slipped from underneath my feet, and before I knew it, the sledge was out of my grasp, and I was floundering in the water.

In 1996,<i> The Golden Compass</i> changed the face of fantasy publishing, and 2006 marks its 10 Year Anniversary--and an opportunity to celebrate with a deluxe hardcover. Pullman created new material just for this edition (archival documents, scientific notes and "found" letters of Lord Asriel) which has been illustrated and handlettered by renowned British artist Ian Beck and will be included in the back matter. The deluxe edition also features Pullman's own chapter opening spot art. A quality collectible--with the enticement of never-before-seen new material--for Pullman fans.</p><p>Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>daemon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had daemons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her daemon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey daemon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br>I love this book, so when we decided to give out copies at a convention this summer, I was thrilled!

Vesuvius, where they try to solve a riddle, reunite a family, and get out of the path of a natural disaster. Reprint.</p><p>Caroline Lawrencegrew up in Bakersfield, California, and claims that some of her ancestors were pioneers, teamsters and newspapermen. Caroline moved to England to studyclassics at Cambridge. After a decade of immersing herself in Roman history to write the Roman Mysteries series, Caroline is now mining the rich vein of American history during the tumultuous 1860s. She currently lives in London by the river with her history-loving husband.She is the author of the P.K. Pinkerton series.Grade 4-7-A mystery set in ancient Rome. When Flavia, Jonathan, Lupus, and Nubia rescue an admiral from a boating accident, he not only rewards them, but he also offers them a riddle that holds the promise of great treasure to anyone who can solve it. He explains that he saw the riddle on the wall of a blacksmith shop and that the blacksmith could help solve it if they can find him. Later, the four friends spend the summer with Flavia's uncle, who lives near Mt. Vesuvius in Pompeii and find Vulcan, the blacksmith. He is an orphan and wants to solve his own mystery of why his parents abandoned him. Just as they are all beginning to figure out these conundrums, the great Vesuvius erupts and they must flee for their lives. The action begins slowly and doesn't really pick up until the volcano starts erupting, about halfway through the book. Also, the mystery element is somewhat confusing and hard to follow. However, the many interesting details about Roman life incorporated into the story provide insight into the period. Readers who are interested in the time as well as fans of the first book in the series, The Thieves of Ostia (Roaring Brook, 2002), may be willing to stick with it until the end.<br><i>Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hanging Woman Creek Lamour Collec</h2><p>&#39;Trusted Seller;, &#39;very good condition</p><p></p><h2>The Widow&#x2019;s Choice: 1941</h2><p>Life during the Great Depression has been hard for Alona Winslow Jennings, but it is turned upside down when she loses her husband in a terrible accident.

Technical info can be found by contacting the Design Library at info@design-library.</p>Never Before Has the universe of printed textiles had a book of this magnitude and lavishness devoted to it. Covering the past two hundred years, during which the industrial revolution drastically altered textile manufacture, <i>Textile Designs: Two Hundred Years of European and American Patterns</i> presents a dazzling cross section of the colorful patterned materials that decorate our rooms and clothe our bodies. These are the textiles of the common man, as opposed to the opulent woven silk brocades, damasks, and velvets that were, before the eighteenth century, almost the only beautifully designed fabrics available. While textile museums' collections tend to focus on these elite and costly examples or emphasize rarities, this volume deals extensively with the textiles of everyday life - the printed calicos and cottons, flowered cretonnes and chintzes, polka-dot silks and foulards. More important, textile museums and books about their collections organize the examples chronologically and geographically. Here, for the first time, is a method of categorizing that is unique and practical: fabrics are organized by motif irrespective of period. Revolutionary! <p>A rich and colorful resource in which glamour and usefulness are stunningly combined, this visual encyclopedia of design motifs groups textiles by pattern into five chapters under the headings FLORAL, GEOMETRIC, CONVERSATIONAL, ETHNIC, and ART MOVEMENTS AND PERIOD STYLES. These chapters follow an introduction that provides a brief discussion of printed textiles. Because of the widespread interest in the subject, this book is published in a worldwide English-language edition that includes translations of all of the pattern names as well as brief introductions in French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. Textile Designs will be indispensable to professionals in the apparel and home-furnishing fields everywhere, an inspiration to designers in the graphic and visual arts, a reference book for quiltmakers and collectors (nearly all the textiles illustrated are dated, and country of origin is identified), and a feast for the eye for lovers of the beautiful. </p><p>1,823 plates in full color</p></p><h2>RAMONA QUIMBY AGE 8</h2><p>Ramona, facing good and bad times during her third-grade year, becomes newly aware of the strength and durability of her loving family</p><p>From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the boisterous Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg into her hair at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with her annoying young neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her classroom. The responsibilities of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting, especially in a family that is trying to squeak by while the father goes back to school. But Ramona is full of too much vim and vigor to ever be down for long. <p> In her second Newbery Honor Book about Ramona (the first was <i>Ramona and Her Father</i>), Beverly Cleary presents another slice of the Quimby family life. Author of more than two dozen children's books, Cleary has a true knack for understanding the tangle of thoughts and emotions in a child's mind and heart. Empathic, witty, and astute, she has earned many other awards, including the Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw</i>. Alan Tiegreen's clever line drawings have charmed countless readers of Cleary's books over the years, and his style is now inextricably tied to hers. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Riding the school bus alone isn't the only new experience making third grade exciting for Ramona Quimby.

Adler is the author of <i>Fun with Roman Numerals</i> and <i>Money Madness.</i> He lives in New York State.Adler (A Picture Book of Jackie Robinson, 1994, etc.) draws even young onlookers into the life of Earhart, whose Kansas childhood included firing a .22 rifle at barn rats and fashioning a roller coaster from fence rails and roller skates. Her social work, medical research, and study of engine repair are outlined, along with her growing passion for airplanes and flying, which resulted in several initial crash landings. Historic flights and accomplishments characterize Earhart's adulthood, told in a factual, yet anecdotal style sure to interest early readers. Earhart's disappearance, the source of much speculation, is skillfully handled. A brief author's note cites theories about that disappearance as well as the lack of evidence to support them. Fisher's illustrations, though clumsy in depicting perspective (e.g., a plane in flight on the cover is curiously close to Earhart's head), are pleasing in that they do not idealize the subject. This is a cogent tribute to an aviation pioneer. (Picture book/biography. 5-9) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But it wasn't.<br>Horris Kew, conjurer, confidence-man, and trickster, had returned to Landover from Ben's own world. Alas, Horris had not returned of his own volition--he had been sent by the Gorse, a sorcerer of great evil, whom Horris had unwittingly freed from the magic Tangle Box, where it had long ago been imprisoned by the fairy folk. Now it had returned to enslave those who had once dared condemn it. But first, it would rid Landover of all who could stand in its way...<br>Soon Ben found himself imprisoned within the gloom of the Tangle Box, lost in its mists and its labyrinthine ways. The only one who could free Ben from the Tangle Box was the lady Willow. But she had disappeared, was gone from Landover on a mysterious mission of her own....</p><p>Terry Brooks published his first novel, The Sword of Shannara, in 1977. It was a New York Times bestseller for more than six months. He has published twenty-five New York Times bestsellers since. Two of those--the novels Running with the Demon and A Knight of the Word--were chosen by the Rocky Mountain News (Denver) as among the best fantasy novels of the twentieth century. A practicing lawyer until his third book was published, Brooks now writes full-time. He lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife, Judine.Brooks continues the magical adventures of Ben Holiday, ex-trial lawyer and now the reigning ruler in the Magic Kingdom of Landover. This latest installment in the series is slower and less charming than its predecessors ( Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold! ; Wizard at Large) , but it is still likely to please readers already hooked. Horris Kew and his talking avian sidekick are brought back from Earth to Landover, where Horris is tricked into letting the Gorse, an evil spirit, out of the Tangle Box, where it has spent a very long time dwelling on its entrapment by the fairies. Now the Gorse wants to overrun Landover and manages to imprison Ben Holiday, the witch Nightshade and the dragon Strabo inside the Tangle Box. Holiday's wife, the non-human Queen Willow, is pregnant and must perform her own difficult quest to ensure a healthy birthing for the child. Meanwhile, with Holiday out of the way, the sinister Gorse coerces Horris into creating serious mischief in the Kingdom. This rather haphazard tale liberally inserts many of the characters made popular in previous books, which may be an asset for hardcore readers who like their fantasy lite.

No recent study has examined the meaning of Wagner&#39;s masterpiece with the attention to detail and intellectual power that Roger Scruton brings to it in this inspiring account. The Ring of Truth is an exploration of the drama, music, symbolism and philosophy of the Ring from a writer whose knowledge and understanding of the Western musical tradition are the equal of his capacities as a philosopher. Scruton shows how, through musical connections and brilliant dramatic strokes, Wagner is able to express truths about the human condition which few other creative artists have been able to convey so convincingly. For Wagner, writes Scruton, the task of art is to &#39;show us freedom in its immediate, contingent, human form, reminding us of what it means to us. Even if we live in a world from which gods and heroes have disappeared we can, by imagining them, dramatize the deep truths of our condition and renew our faith in what we are.&#39; Love, death, sacrifice and the liberation that we win through sacrifice - these are the great themes of the Ring, as they are of this book. Scruton&#39;s passionate and moving interpretation allows us to understand more fully than ever how Wagner conveys his ideas about who we are, and why the Ring continues to be such a hypnotically absorbing work.</p><p>Roger Scruton is a writer and philosopher who has held positions at the universities of London, Oxford, Boston and St Andrews and who has written widely on art, architecture, music and aesthetics. His books include his now classic Short History of Modern Philosophy (1981), The Aesthetics of Music (1997), Death-Devoted Heart: Sex and the Sacred in Wagner&#39;s Tristan and Isolde (2004), Fools, Frauds and Firebrands (1985, republished 2015) an examination of the New Left and its influence on intellectual life in Europe and America. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.After reading this book, only the most unadventurous reader would turn down the chance to see Wagner&#39;s masterpiece. * Economist * Roger Scruton is in many ways the ideal interpreter of the Ring -- Adam Lively * The Sunday Times * Highly original and penetrating ... he writes about the music authoritatively but comprehensibly... lucidly, cogently and even entertainingly -- Tim Blanning * Literary Review * Admirably lucid ... a perceptive and detailed account ... constantly enlightening commentary -- Lucy Beckett * Tablet *</p><h2>The Greatest Prayer: Rediscovering the Revolutionary Message of the Lord&#39;s Prayer</h2><p><p>In <em>The Greatest Prayer, </em>foremost historical Jesus scholar John Dominic Crossan, bestselling author of <em>Historical Jesus </em>and<em> Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>,<em> </em>intimately explores the revolutionary meaning of the cornerstone of Christian faith: The Lord&#x2019;s Prayer. </p></p><p><p>Every Sunday, the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer echoes in churches around the world.</p><p>It is an indisputable principle of Christian faith.

All this and more is shown in Gary Russell&#x2019;s lavishly illustrated book. Russell spent time on the set in New Zealand, conducting interviews with director Peter Jackson, special effects guru Richard Taylor, art directors Paul Lasainne, Dan Hennah, and Chris Hennah, costumer Ngila Dickson, and Alan Lee and John Howe. Featuring everything from pencil sketches to the finished objects, his book gives detailed descriptions of why and how this groundbreaking film looks as exciting as it does.

The author of The Lord of the Rings: The Art of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Art of the Return of the King, Russell has worked widely in media as a magazine editor, novelist, columnist, and audio drama producer.The third tie-in volume to Peter Jackson's smash film adaptation of the fantasy epic spotlights the hundreds of paintings, sketches, and models used to construct the film's sets, design costumes, build props, and more. Essentially, this is a catalog of roughly 500 striking images of the conceptual art juxtaposed with the finished item used on film, whether it be a house, a cloak, weaponry, or any of the assorted beasties. The book covers all facets of the physical creation of Tolkien's world on film. The illustrations are accompanied with captions written by British writer/editor Russell and based on interviews conducted with the numerous painters, sculptors, costume designers, prop makers, and others responsible for converting the story from page to screen. Because of the price, the film's legions of fans might not want to pop for the book themselves, but they will gladly borrow it, so it's worth the investment. Recommended.

When he confronts her, they learn that with a bit of ingenuity and cooperation, they can clean both floors and still have time to plant a garden. In The Invitations, the new friends attempt to share a meal, but their innate differences&#x2013;Mole likes his house damp and dark and eats worms, Mouse likes the warm sun and prefers cheese&#x2013;make it impossible. Next, the animals find clever ways to reconcile their dissimilarities: Mole presents Mouse with some candles to use when she visits, and she gives him a pair of sunglasses. In the final entry, Mole surprises Mouse with a rowboat. Although it's missing an oar, they manage to have fun. The next day, Mouse has a surprise of her own&#x2013;a new paddle to make A <i>pair</i>...like <i>you</i> and <i>me</i>! The expressive bamboo-pen and watercolor with colored-pencil illustrations capture the humor of the situations as well as the emotions of the characters. With its controlled vocabulary, repetition, and humor, this tale of friendship also introduces opposites, homophones, and letter writing.

Kubo made his debut with <b><i>ZOMBIEPOWDER</i></b>, a four-volume series for <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i>. To date, <b><i>Bleach </i></b>has been translated into numerous languages and has also inspired an animated TV series that began airing in Japan in 2004. Beginning its serialization in 2001, <b><i>Bleach</i></b> is still a mainstay in the pages of <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i>. In 2005, <b><i>Bleach </i></b>was awarded the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award in the shonen (boys) category.Gamma Akutabi is a master criminal ("class S-zero") with a chainsaw sword and a metal arm that allows him to catch bullets. He's also a Powder Hunter, which means he's chasing after the Rings of the Dead. If he finds 12 of them, he can make zombie powder, which resurrects the dead and grants the living immortality. He's joined in his quest by his partner, gun-toting, suit-wearing CT Smith, and John Elwood Shepherd, a young knife-thrower turned pickpocket who wants to resurrect his dead sister. The series originally appeared in the Japanese magazine <i>Shonen Jump</i>, but was canceled before it could be completed. If these first chapters are any indication, it's not hard to figure out why. Written and drawn by Kubo (<i>Bleach!</i>), the promising setup is little more than an excuse for a series of mindless action scenes. Kube's art begins by doing some intriguing things with grayscale and shading, but quickly devolves into generic action sequences that sacrifice clear storytelling for dramatic, anatomically impossible poses. Combined with the already chaotic plot, the overall effect is like reading a hyperactive cartoonist's book after his Ritalin has run out. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But to Frances&#39;s dismay, Johnny is hesitant to marry her. Attempting to ease her aching heart, Frances accepts an offer to go to New York City and escort a group of orphans out West to new homes. Along the way she must deal with a flood of painful memories and a threatening stranger. Will Frances be able to complete her mission...and return home to find out what her future will be?</p><p>Grade 5-8. This latest installment in the life of the Kelly family focuses on 19-year-old Frances, who doesn't understand why Johnny Mueller, recovering physically and emotionally from a year in a Confederate POW camp, feels unready to commit to marriage. Hurt, she agrees to accompany an orphan who is to be reunited with his aunt and uncle in New York City where she becomes an escort for 30 orphan-train children on the return trip. At this point, much of the story becomes repetitive. Over and over Frances soothes frightened children, recalls her own fears, broods over Johnny, and ties bows in the girls' hair before they meet prospective parents at each stop. Her encounter with a former Confederate soldier-turned-bank-robber, traveling disguised as a minister, adds some excitement and gives her a new perspective on Johnny. The conclusion, in which Frances and Johnny are reconciled and agree to adopt rambunctious, charming Eddie, whom no one else wants, is predictable but comforting. Don't expect this story to deliver the punch of earlier titles in this series, such as Keeping Secrets (1995) or A Dangerous Promise (1994; both Delacorte). This orphan train chugs along at the more leisurely pace of any early romance with a dash of mystery.?Peggy Morgan, The Library Network, Wayne, NJ<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-6. Frances Kelly wants to marry young Johnny, recently returned home to Kansas from the Civil War. Johnny, however, has physical and spiritual war wounds to heal first, before he can think about marriage to his 19-year-old sweetheart. After an argument, Frances agrees to escort an orphan to New York, and then travel back west with 30 other children looking for families to adopt them. Rooted in historical fact, the narrative follows Frances' adventures on the train, the same train that carried her to an adoptive home just six years earlier. As Frances tries to meet the needs of her charges, she struggles with her own emotions. The story contains sadness, love, danger, and suspense.

Roberts</h2><p>In <i>For Crew and Country</i>, John Wukovits tells of&nbsp;the most dramatic naval battle of the Pacific War and the incredible sacrifice of the <i>USS Samuel B. Roberts.</i><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On October 25, 1944,&nbsp;the <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i>, along with the other twelve vessels comprising&nbsp;its unit, stood between&nbsp;Japan's largest battleship force ever sent to sea and MacArthur&#x2019;s transports inside Leyte Gulf. Faced with the surprise appearance of more than twenty Japanese battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, including the <i>Yamato</i>, at 70,000 tons the most potent battlewagon in the world, the 1,200-ton <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i> turned immediately into action with six other ships.&nbsp;Captain Copeland marked the occasion with one of the most poignant addresses ever given to men on the edge of battle: &#x201c;Men,&#x201d; he said over the intercom, &#x201c;we are about to go into a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected.&#x201d;</p><p>The ship churned straight at the enemy in a near-suicidal attempt to deflect the more potent foe, allow the small aircraft carriers to escape, and buy time for MacArthur&#x2019;s forces. The <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i>, a John C. Butler-class destroyer escort, was sunk, going down with guns blazing in a duel reminiscent of the Spartans at Thermopylae or Davy Crockett&#x2019;s Alamo defenders. The men who survived&nbsp;faced a&nbsp;horrifying three-day nightmare in the sea, where they battled a lack of food and water,&nbsp;scorching sun and numbing nighttime cold, and nature&#x2019;s most feared adversary&#x2014;sharks.</p><p>The battle would go down as history's greatest sea clash, the Battle of Samar&#x2014;the dramatic climax of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. </p></p><p><p>JOHN K.

He lives in Trenton, Michigan.</p>1 <br> <br>&#x201c;YOU ARE NOW A MEMBER OF A GREAT FIGHTING TEAM&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Rarely has a hotel hospitality room held such a collection of unassuming sea warriors as the one that gathered in San Pedro, California, in August 1982. They had come from Utah and Virginia, Michigan and Arizona, and more than ten states in between. They set aside garage tools and law books, left schoolrooms, farms, factories, and police stations, and made room in packed schedules, because of their shared bond. As shipmates of the World War II destroyer escort USS <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i> (DE-413), they came to honor their skipper, Robert W. Copeland. His command of the feisty destroyer escort thirty-eight years earlier had catapulted him to the ranks of admiral and earned him the rare honor the United States Navy was bestowing that August 7, 1982: naming a warship of the fleet after him. The frigate, USS <i>Copeland</i> (FFG-25), would that day be commissioned. <br>The aging men, most in their fifties and sixties, had shared the same dangers&#x2014;some were, in fact, at his very side&#x2014;in 1944 when Copeland turned his diminutive vessel toward those Japanese battleships and cruisers intent on annihilating his ship. Despite being badly outgunned, Copeland charged the foe in a David-and-Goliath feat that prodded one deputy chief of naval operations to call the vessel &#x201c;the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship.&#x201d;1 They wanted to be with the Copeland family today, their skipper&#x2019;s second moment of triumph. <br>They came out of respect and love, for their commander and for each other. Red Harrington, labeled &#x201c;the bearded and tattooed Boatswain&#x201d; by the ship&#x2019;s newsletter in September 1944, was one of those venerable chiefs that helped every skipper run a ship.2 He was all navy, and his gruff ways and piercing glare had unnerved more than a few seamen, some of whom thought his flowing red beard gave him the visage of a buccaneer of yore rather than a navy chief. <br>Red had served aboard many ships and worked with various crews, but none topped that of the <i>Samuel B. Roberts.</i> He said that Copeland and his officers instilled a can-do spirit among the crew that &#x201c;I have never seen excelled in all my years as a Navy man.&#x201d; When Copeland promoted Harrington to boatswain&#x2019;s mate first class, Harrington vowed to never let the man down, and he had &#x201c;tried for the rest of my life to justify his faith in me.&#x201d;3 <br>He wrote shortly after this initial reunion that after the war he tried to forget his experiences. &#x201c;Then, at the reunion, after all those years, seeing all who were kids with me, doing such a wonderful job at being men, I felt such pleasure for having had the honor to know and serve with them.&#x201d; Harrington added, &#x201c;Those men on the <i>Sammy B.</i> were my family, my home; they were closer to me than I can say.&#x2026; I now know men do not fight for flag or country or glory. They fight for one another. Any man in combat who lacks comrades who will die for him is not a man at all. He is truly damned.&#x201d;4 <br>The tight bond was evident at the Friday evening banquet when, amid laughter and revelry fueled by friendship and a drink, Harriet Copeland and Suzette Hartley, Copeland&#x2019;s widow and daughter, entered the room. Everyone turned to the pair and broke into a standing ovation, a mark of respect for the family members and of the fondness the men retained for their former skipper. To the aging sailors, Copeland stood for all that was noble in a man, all they had attempted to be during the war and afterward. <br>One by one the survivors walked to the front and shared a memory about their ship or took a moment to tell the others what the ship meant to them. They laughed&#x2014;and Jack laughed with them&#x2014;about Jack Yusen&#x2019;s comical tendency to be Harrington&#x2019;s daily target whenever the chief wanted another part of the ship painted, but they also spoke jealously of &#x201c;Hollywood&#x201d; Yusen receiving more mail from pretty girls than the rest did combined. They remembered Norbert Brady&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fantail Fellowship Club,&#x201d; a group of sailors who gathered nightly on the ship&#x2019;s fantail to sing, smoke, and chew over the day&#x2019;s events, and talked about Jackson McCaskill spending more time in the brig than anyone else. They howled again at Charles Natter&#x2019;s amiable teasing of everyone in the crew and grinned about the battle Lt. (jg) John LeClercq waged to grow a few whiskers on that baby face of his. <br>They agreed that on October 25, 1944, they waged a desperate fight against Japanese battleships and cruisers. They recalled the fear, the bravery, the torpedoes slicing through the waters, and the unrelenting screech of incoming shells. <br>Because of their experience they grasped better than most why William Shakespeare had chosen to forever memorialize another October 25. In the play <i>Henry V,</i> King Henry V of England utters a memorable speech to his outnumbered troops before leading them into the Battle of Agincourt on October 25, 1415. They understood why the famous bard, through Henry, had described the soldiers as &#x201c;we few, we happy few, we band of brothers,&#x201d; for like the British soldiers they, too, over the course of six months, had fashioned a band of brothers, this at sea. Like the British soldiers they, too, had faced insurmountable odds. <br>They would also privately agree, for most would never admit it publicly, with what <i>The New York Times</i> concluded shortly after the battle, that &#x201c;the gallant action fought by this group&#x2014;particularly the short-lived battle put up by the four ships that were sunk&#x2014;will surely go down in American naval tradition as one of the most heroic episodes in our history.&#x201d; They would agree with the heralded naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison, who labeled their actions against the Japanese on October 25, 1944, &#x201c;forever memorable, forever glorious,&#x201d; and with the acclaimed novelist Herman Wouk, who wrote that the vision of the <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i> charging through the waters straight at Japanese battleships and cruisers &#x201c;can endure as a picture of the way Americans fight when they don&#x2019;t have superiority. Our schoolchildren should know about that incident, and our enemies should ponder it,&#x201d; for the action is &#x201c;one that will stir human hearts long after all the swords are plowshares: gallantry against high odds.&#x201d;5 <br>In 1941, however, neither Yusen nor Harrington had a clue of the momentous events that awaited them. Like most Americans in the carefree days before Pearl Harbor tossed their worlds into disarray, Robert Copeland, Charles Natter, Norbert Brady, John LeClercq, and the rest of the men who comprised the crew of the <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i> had other things on their minds. <br>&#x201c;Where Is Pearl Harbor?&#x201d; <br>Their journey began with shock and disbelief. In New Jersey, seventeen-year-old Charles Natter walked with his Atlantic City High School buddy John Stinson to their favorite hangout, the malt shop across from school, where the pair heard that the Japanese had just bombed some place called Pearl Harbor. Girls and swimming had dominated their thoughts. Would that somehow change? <br>Accompanied by his Georgetown University friends, nineteen-year-old Tom Stevenson crashed through the gate at Griffith Stadium, laughing and making wisecracks on his way to watch the Redskins challenge the Philadelphia Eagles. In the midst of the reverie, over the public address system an announcer listed the names of high-ranking military officers in attendance with orders to report immediately to their stations. Tom looked quizzically at his friends, who returned similar glances. When the game ended, Stevenson and the group streamed outside to hear newsboys hawking special editions of their newspapers. JAPS BOMB PEARL HARBOR, screamed the headline. The college students turned to each other and asked, &#x201c;Where is Pearl Harbor?&#x201d;6 <br>Across the country in Utah, sixteen-year-old H. Whitney (Whit) Felt was studying for final exams when an announcer interrupted the musical program on the radio with the news of a sneak attack against Pearl Harbor. &#x201c;I called Mother and Dad who came running to my room to hear the shocking news. Then I telephoned Leah [his girlfriend] to see if she had heard about it. We all began wondering how this sudden change of events would affect our lives.&#x201d;7 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>President Franklin D. Roosevelt pondered the same gloomy thoughts as he sat in the White House study on December 7, 1941, reading messages from his military commanders at the sprawling American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, saying that it was under attack. In two waves of aircraft launched from carriers, the Japanese destroyed 188 American aircraft and damaged another 159. The Japanese sank or damaged 21 ships, including 7 battleships, killed 2,403 Americans, and wounded another 1,178. The navy lost three times as many men at Pearl Harbor as it had lost in the Spanish-American War of 1898 and World War I combined. <br>Jubilation on the other side of the world contrasted with the dismay that gripped the United States. Admiral Matome Ugaki, chief of staff of the Japanese Combined Fleet, wrote in his diary on December 7, 1941, &#x201c;The long-anticipated day has arrived at last.&#x201d; Ugaki added that he &#x201c;listened with attention to every telegram&#x201d; and that &#x201c;enemy consternation is beyond description. It is their breakfast time. While they were at their breakfast table, great masses of Japanese airplanes came like bolts from the blue; I can imagine their utter surprise.&#x201d;8 <br>Japan&#x2019;s swift, sudden assault would dramatically impact the futures of millions. Among them were more than two hundred young men and their families, then scattered to every corner of the nation. The officers and enlisted who would comprise the crew of the USS <i>Samuel B.

It all started back home in Virginia, with the blue sweater, a gift that quickly became her prized possession&#x2015;until the day she outgrew it and gave it away to Goodwill. Eleven years later in Africa, she spotted a young boy wearing that very sweater, with her name still on the tag inside. That the sweater had made its trek all the way to Rwanda was ample evidence, she thought, of how we are all connected, how our actions&#x2015;and inaction&#x2015;touch people every day across the globe, people we may never know or meet.<br>From her first stumbling efforts as a young idealist venturing forth in Africa to the creation of the trailblazing organization she runs today, Novogratz tells gripping stories with unforgettable characters&#x2015;women dancing in a Nairobi slum, unwed mothers starting a bakery, courageous survivors of the Rwandan genocide, entrepreneurs building services for the poor against impossible odds. <br>She shows, in ways both hilarious and heartbreaking, how traditional charity often fails, but how a new form of philanthropic investing called "patient capital" can help make people self-sufficient and can change millions of lives. More than just an autobiography or a how-to guide to addressing poverty, <i>The Blue Sweater</i> is a call to action that challenges us to grant dignity to the poor and to rethink our engagement with the world.</p></p><p><p>Jacqueline Novogratz is founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, a nonprofit venture capital firm for the poor that invests in sustainable enterprises bringing healthcare, safe water, alternative energy, and housing to low-income people in the developing world.

He was like Santa to me, even in the middle of July.<br><br>Of soft blue wool, with stripes on the sleeves and an African motif across the front--two zebras walking in front of a snowcapped mountain--the sweater made me dream of places far away. I hadn't heard of Mount Kilimanjaro, nor did I have any idea that Africa would one day find a prominent place in my heart. Still, I loved that sweater and wore it often and everywhere. I wrote my name on the tag to ensure that it would be mine forever.<br><br>In our neighborhood in Virginia in the 1970s, new clothing was a once- or twice-a-year event. We would shop in September for school and at Christmastime and then make do for the year. As the eldest of seven children, at least I didn't have to wear many hand-me-downs, and I liked choosing my own clothes; still, I loved that blue sweater. I wore it for years--right through middle school and into my freshman year in high school- -though it started to fit me differently then, hugging adolescent curves I fought mightily to ignore.<br><br>But then my high school nemesis (who would burn down the school in our senior year by throwing a Molotov cocktail into the principal's office) ruined everything. At our school, the cool kids and athletes hung out in "Jock Hall," the area right outside the gym. During football season, the cheerleaders would decorate the hall with crepe paper streamers while the guys strutted around like peacocks in green and gold jerseys. Only a freshman, I was breathless just to be admitted to the scene. One Friday afternoon, the captain of the team had asked me on a date right there in the middle of the hall. The very air seemed to crackle with expectation.<br><br>And there was that mean kid, standing right beside me, talking to boys from the junior varsity football team about the first ski trip of the winter. He stared at my sweater, and I gave him the coldest look I could muster. "We don't have to go anywhere to ski," he yelled, pointing at my chest. "We can do it on Mount Novogratz."<br><br>The other boys joined him in laughter. I died a thousand deaths.<br><br>That afternoon, I marched home and announced to my mother that the vile sweater had to go. How could she have let me walk out of the house looking so mortifyingly bad? Despite my high drama, she drove me to the Goodwill in our Ford station wagon with the wood panels on the sides. Ceremoniously, we disposed of the sweater; I was glad never to have to see it again and tried hard to forget it.<br><br>FAST-FORWARD TO EARLY 1987: Twenty-five years old, I was jogging up and down the hilly streets of Kigali, Rwanda. I'd come to the country to help establish a microfinance institution for poor women. With my Walkman playing Joe Cocker singing "With a Little Help from My Friends," I felt as if I were in a music video. On the road, women walked with bunches of yellow bananas on their heads, their hips swaying in time with the song's rhythm. Even the tall cypress trees at the roadsides seemed to shimmy. I was in a dream on a sunny, big-sky Kigali afternoon, far away from home.<br><br>From out of nowhere, a young boy walked toward me, wearing the sweater--my sweater, the beloved but abandoned blue one. He was perhaps 10 years old, skinny, with a shaved head and huge eyes, not more than 4 feet tall. The sweater hung so low it hid his shorts, covering toothpick legs and knobby knees. Only his fingertips poked out of baggy sleeves. Still, there was no doubt: This was my sweater.<br><br>Excitedly, I ran over to the child, who looked up at me, obviously terrified. I didn't speak a word of Kinyarwanda, nor did he speak French, the language on which I relied in Rwanda. As the boy stood frozen, I kept pointing to the sweater, trying not to become too agitated. I grabbed him by the shoulders and turned down the collar: Sure enough, my name was written on the tag of my sweater that had traveled thousands of miles for more than a decade.<br><br>The blue sweater had made a complex journey, from Alexandria, Virginia, to Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. It may have gone first to a little girl in the United States, then back to the Goodwill once more before traveling across the ocean, most likely to Mombasa, on the coast of Kenya, one of Africa's most active ports. It would have arrived after being fumigated and packed into 100-�d bales along with other pieces of cast-off clothing, everything from T-shirts sold at bars at the Jersey shore to overcoats to evening gowns. The bales would have been sold to secondhand clothing distributors, who would allow retailers to discard the useless pieces and buy what they thought they could sell. Over time, many of those secondhand clothing traders would move into the middle class.<br><br>The story of the blue sweater has always reminded me of how we are all connected. Our actions--and inaction--touch people we may never know and never meet across the globe. The story of the blue sweater is also my personal story: Seeing my sweater on that child renewed my sense of purpose in Africa. At that point in my own journey, my world-view was shifting. I'd begun my career as an international banker, discovering the power of capital, of markets, and of politics, as well as how the poor are so often excluded from all three. I wanted to understand better what stands between poverty and wealth.<br><br>It had been a long and winding road getting to Rwanda in the first place-- an unimagined outcome of choices made, sometimes with a sense of purpose, at times with reason, and sometimes simply by choosing the less traveled paths.<br><br>WHEN I WAS 5, our family lived in Detroit. It was the mid-1960s and the city was plagued by race riots and protests against the Vietnam War. My dashing father, a lieutenant in the army, had the unenviable job of helping the mothers of dead soldiers bury their sons. I remember hearing my father's strained voice as he told my mother about the injustice of so many young soldiers being economically disadvantaged. My mother, young and beautiful, would hug me close when I'd ask so many questions about why people weren't all treated the same way.<br><br>The next year, my father was serving his second of three tours in Vietnam and Korea, and we'd moved to a town outside of West Point, New York. I would walk to school early to meet my first-grade teacher, Sister Mary Theophane, and help her clean the sacristy. She was a jolly woman with round, wire-rimmed glasses that matched her apple face, and I adored being near her. I'd run past little mom-and-pop shops on the quiet streets, dressed in the dark green pleated skirt and pressed white cotton blouse I would have laid out the night before to ensure I wouldn't be late.<br><br>Sacred Heart was an old school, right next door to the church, with little wooden desks for the students and a concrete playground outside. Sister was known as one of the kindest of the nuns, though she had high expectations for content--and handwriting. If we earned a perfect test score, she'd hand us a card with a summary of the life of a saint printed on it, and I studied diligently to collect as many cards as I could. I found their lives an inspiration, even if some of them did end up in vats of boiling oil.<br><br>A poster of two hands holding a rice bowl hung on the classroom wall, making me think about faraway places, trying to imagine the lives of children in China, wanting to see it for myself. When I told Sister Theophane I wanted to be a nun, she enfolded me in her thick black robes and told me I was just a child, but it was a lovely idea.<br><br>"Regardless of what you become," she said, "remember always that to whom much is given, much is expected. God gave you many gifts and it is important that you use them for others as best you can."<br><br>Though we moved again and again throughout the United States until I was 10 years old, my mother and father masterfully created a sense of home, making us feel safe and rooted no matter where we lived. By the time I entered high school, our brood was living in a four-bedroom house in suburban Virginia: It was the place all the neighborhood kids wanted to be. Dreams of the convent had long passed, and I thought much more about boys and parties, though I still expected to change the world.<br><br>In summertime, my uncle Ed who gave me the sweater would throw big parties for our extended family, which meant my grandmother and her five sisters, their children, and their children's children. We were a tribe of hundreds made larger by close friends who came to feel like they shared the same blood in their veins. We called my grandmother and her sisters, all from good peasant stock in Austria, the Six Tons of Fun. They worked hard, but they knew how to enjoy themselves, dancing with full glasses of beer balanced on their heads and laughing as they whispered stories to one another. Meanwhile, their offspring would play competitive games and drink and dance till the wee hours of the morning. If there was a family ethic, it was to work hard, go to church, be good to your family, and live out loud. We learned from our elders to be tough, to not complain, and to always show up for one another. I didn't understand then how much about tribe and community I learned from this American family.<br><br>The strained finances at home meant that my siblings and I had no choice but to be scrappy and enterprising. At 10, I babysat and sold Christmas ornaments door-to-door. By 12, I was shoveling snow in the winter and mowing grass in the summer. At 14, I spent the summer working the midnight shift behind the ice cream counter at Howard Johnson's until a toppled bucket of boiling water sent me to the hospital with third-degree burns. Not long after, I was bartending, earning $300 in tips on a good night.<br><br>These jobs--plus a series of student loans--allowed me to finance my education at the University of Virginia. As I was about to graduate, I remember feeling a deep sense of pride in knowing that I would forever have the tools to support myself, no matter what happened in life. But I wanted a break and hoped to take some time off to tend bar and ski and then figure out how I would change the world. My parents agreed to the plan, provided that I promise to go through the interview process--"just for practice."<br><br>At the University Career Center, I dutifully dropped my resume in all of the boxes labeled for job seekers in international relations or economics, and I was surprised when the center called to tell me I had an interview with Chase Manhattan Bank. I walked into the first interview of my life, dressed in a drab gray, masculine wool suit that made me feel like an imposter, and met a young man with sandy blond hair and piercing blue eyes who didn't look much older than me.<br><br>"Tell me why you want to be a banker," he suggested after introducing himself.<br><br>I looked at him for a moment, not knowing what to say. Being a terrible liar, I told him the truth.<br><br>"I don't want to be a banker," I said. "I want to change the world. I'm hoping to take next year off, but my parents asked me to go through the interview process. I'm so sorry."<br><br>"Well," he said with a grin, shaking his head, "that's too bad. Because if you got this job, you would be traveling to 40 countries in the next 3 years and learning a lot not only about banking, but the entire world."<br><br>I gulped. "Is that really true?" I asked, my face completely red. "You know, part of my dream is to travel and learn about the world."<br><br>"It is really true," he sighed.<br><br>"Then do you think we might start this interview all over again?" I asked.<br><br>"Why not?" he shrugged, raising his eyebrows and smiling.<br><br>I walked out the door and closed it, counted to 10, walked back in, and introduced myself with a big handshake.<br><br>"So, Miss Novogratz," he smiled. "Tell me, why do you want to be a banker?"<br><br>"Well, ever since I was 6 years old, it has been my dream ... ," I started.<br><br>And it went from there.<br><br>Miraculously, I got the job, and thus began 3 of the best years of my life. I moved to New York City and, after completing the credit training program, joined a group called Credit Audit, a division of 60 young bankers, most just out of university, who would fly first-class around the world and review the quality of the bank's loans, especially in troubled economies. The first time I ever left the United States, I landed in Singapore; the second, Argentina. Life had become a dream.<br><br>In Chile, we would spend the day reviewing loans made to copper mines and industrial concerns. In Peru, I came to understand the danger capital flight presented to already unstable economies. In Hong Kong, we studied the great trading houses such as Jardine Matheson and saw firsthand how Asia was rapidly changing. It was a stunning, privileged education. I began to see myself as a wanderer and a wonderer, a true citizen of the world. But no place changed my life like Brazil.<br><br>The minute I landed in Rio, I felt I'd arrived in a magical place that somehow already lived inside me. We walked off the plane and across the tarmac in a light summer rainstorm while just beyond us there was not a cloud in the bright blue sky. Though our job at the bank was to write off millions of dollars in debt that would never be collected, the Brazilians there were friendly and warm, never taking themselves, or us, too seriously. I worked till late during the week, always to the dismay of my Brazilian colleagues, who tried hard to explain that "Americans live to work while we work to live." I used the weekends to explore.</p><h2>What the Songs Look Like: Contemporary Artists Interpret Talking Heads&#39; Songs</h2><p>A collection of fifty-three of the Talking Heads most popular songs, with the lyrics interpreted and illustrated by noted contemporary artists, including Robert Rauschenberg, Keith Haring, Sue Coe, Linda Barry, and Talking Heads lead singer David Byrne</p><p></p><h2>Siege: Trump Under Fire</h2><p><p><b>Michael Wolff, author of the bombshell bestseller <i>Fire and Fury</i>, once again takes us inside the Trump presidency to reveal a White House under siege.</b></p><p>Just one year into Donald Trump&#x2019;s term as president, Michael Wolff told the electrifying story of a White House consumed by controversy, chaos, and intense rivalries. <i>Fire and Fury</i>, an instant sensation, defined the first phase of the Trump administration; now, in <i>Siege</i>, Wolff has written an equally essential and explosive book about a presidency that is under fire from almost every side.</p><p>At the outset of Trump&#x2019;s second year as president, his situation is profoundly different.

You stared up at it in something like awe, and sometimes you caught your breath because the view was one of majestic splendor. The clear silhouettes of the buildings slashed at the sky, devouring the blue; flat planes and long planes, rough rectangles and needle sharp spires, minarets and peaks, pattern upon pattern laid in geometric unity against the wash of blue and white which was the sky. </p><p> And at night, coming down the River Highway, you were caught in a dazzling galaxy of brilliant suns, a web of lights strung out from the river and then south to capture the city in a brilliant display of electrical wizardry. The highway lights glistened close and glistened farther as they skirted the city and reflected in the dark waters of the river. The windows of the buildings climbed in brilliant rectangular luminosity, climbed to the stars and joined the wash of red and green and yellow and orange neon which tinted the sky. The traffic lights blinked their gaudy eyes and along The Stem, the incandescent display tangled in a riot of color and eye-aching splash. </p><p> The city lay like a sparkling nest of rare gems, shimmering in layer upon layer of pulsating intensity. </p><p> The buildings were a stage set. </p><p> They faced the river, and they glowed with man-made brilliance, and you stared up at them in awe, and you caught your breath. </p><p> Behind the buildings, behind the lights, were the streets. </p><p> There was garbage in the streets. </p><p><br> The alarm sounded at eleven P.M. </p><p> He reached out for it, groping in the darkness, finding the lever and pressing it against the back of the clock. The buzzing stopped. The room was very silent. Beside him, he could hear May's even breathing. The windows were wide open, but the room was hot and damp, and he thought again about the air conditioning unit he'd wanted to buy since the summer began. Reluctantly, he sat up and rubbed hamlike fists into his eyes. </p><p> He was a big man, his head topped with straight blond hair that was unruly now. His eyes were normally grey, but they were virtually colorless in the darkness of the room, puffed with sleep. He stood up and stretched. He slept only in pajama pants, and when he raised his arms over his head, the pants slipped down over the flatness of his hard belly. He let out a grunt, pulled up the pants, and then glanced at May again. </p><p> The sheet was wadded at the foot of the bed, a soggy lifeless mass. May lay curled into a sprawling C, her gown twisted up over her thigh. He went to the bed and put his hand on her thigh for an instant. She murmured and rolled over. He grinned in the darkness and then went into the bathroom to shave. </p><p> He had timed every step of the operation, and so he knew just how long it took to shave, just how long it took to dress, just how long it took to gulp a quick cup of coffee. He took off his wristwatch before he began shaving, leaving it on the washbasin where he could glance at it occasionally. At eleven-ten, he began dressing. He put on an Aloha shirt his brother had sent him from Hawaii. He put on a pair of tan gabardine slacks, and a light poplin windbreaker. He put a handkerchief in his left hip pocket, and then scooped his wallet and change off the dresser. </p><p> He opened the top drawer of the dresser and took the .38 from where it lay next to May's jewelry box. His thumb passed over the hard leather of the holster, and then he shoved the holster and gun into his right hip pocket, beneath the poplin jacket. He lit a cigarette, went into the kitchen to put up the coffee water, and then went to check on the kids. </p><p> Mickey was asleep, his thumb in his mouth as usual. He passed his hand over the boy's head. Christ, he was sweating like a pig. He'd have to talk to May about the air conditioning again. It wasn't fair to the kids, cooped up like this in a sweat box. He walked to Cathy's bed and went through the same ritual. She wasn't as perspired as her brother. Well, she was a girl, girls didn't sweat as much. He heard the kettle in the kitchen whistling loudly. He glanced at his watch, and then grinned. </p><p> He went into the kitchen, spooned two teaspoonfuls of instant coffee into a large cup, and then poured the boiling water over the powder. He drank the coffee black, without sugar. He felt himself coming awake at last, and he vowed for the hundredth time that he wouldn't try to catch any sleep before this tour, it was plain stupid. He should sleep when he got home, hell, what did he average this way? A couple of hours? And then it was time to go in. No, it was foolish. He'd have to talk to May about it. He gulped the coffee down, and then went into his bedroom again. </p><p> He liked to look at her asleep. He always felt a little sneaky and a little horny when he took advantage of her that way. Sleep was a kind of private thing, and it wasn't right to pry when somebody was completely unaware. But, God, she was beautiful when she was asleep, so what the hell, it wasn't fair. He watched her for several moments, the dark hair spread out over the pillow, the rich sweep of her hip and thigh, the femaleness of the raised gown and the exposed white flesh. He went to the side of the bed, and brushed the hair back from her temple. He kissed her very gently, but she stirred and said, "Mike?" </p><p> "Go back to sleep, honey." </p><p> "Are you leaving?" she murmured hoarsely. </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Be careful, Mike." </p><p> "I will." He grinned. "And you be good." </p><p> "Uhm," she said, and then she rolled over into the pillow. He sneaked a last look at her from the doorway, and then went through the living room and out of the house. He glanced at his watch. It was eleven-thirty. Right on schedule, and damn if it wasn't a lot cooler in the street. </p><p><br> At eleven forty-one, when Mike Reardon was three blocks away from his place of business, two bullets entered the back of his skull and ripped away half his face when they left his body. He felt only impact and sudden unbearable pain, and then vaguely heard the shots, and then everything inside him went dark, and he crumpled to the pavement. </p><p> He was dead before he struck the ground. </p><p> He had been a citizen of the city, and now his blood poured from his broken face and spread around him in a sticky red smear. </p><p> Another citizen found him at eleven fifty-six, and went to call the police. There was very little difference between the citizen who rushed down the street to a phone booth, and the citizen named Mike Reardon who lay crumpled and lifeless against the concrete. </p><p> Except one. </p><p> Mike Reardon was a cop. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 1956 by Ed McBain<br> Copyright renewed � 1984 by Evan Hunter</p></p><h2>Black Cat, Vol. 1</h2><p>Two years ago, Train, a high-level assassin known as Number XIII in Chronos, left the secret society to live by his own rules. Since then, Train has been a sweeper, a bounty hunter, catching criminals and bringing them in alive. But his main mission is to find a former Chronos member who killed his best friend.</p><p>Kentaro Yabuki made his manga debut with Yamato Gensouki, a short series about a young empress destined to unite the warring states of ancient Japan and the boy sworn to protect her. Black Cat is his most recent series.Although working within tired conventions, this collection adds up to a surprisingly enjoyable action adventure. Train and Sven are "sweepers," smalltime bounty hunters who survive hand to mouth. Sven is an eye-patched ex-cop; Train is a glamorously mysterious ex-crook. Along the way, the two team up with cute but sneaky Rinslet Walker, who's planning a big heist from a really dangerous master criminal. Readers may be reminded of <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> and a host of similar capers, but the interaction of these characters is brisk and funny, partly because they feel like such old friends. The dash of novelty is Train's not-so-secret identity as the Black Cat, formerly an unkillable assassin for a worldwide criminal conspiracy. He not only does incredible stunts like any action hero but also looks and behaves like a cat, agile and unpredictably feline: aloof and irritating one moment, then ingratiating and playful the next. He's the kind of hard-boiled manhunter who'd take a criminal on a good-bye visit to his family, while excusing the trip as a chance to sample a new town's famous onion buns. The art is familiar but well executed as Yabuki gives old material an enjoyable workout. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jesus, please hold my heart in Your hand. Don&#39;t let me give it or any piece of it away. I want YOU to give it away in your time, to the right person. Please hold it tight, lock it up, and keep the key. October 8, 1836. Millie sighed. I will be sixteen in a week. Sixteen is too young for romance, isn&#39;t it? Millie quickly snapped her diary shut. Lord, I gave you my heart. Don&#39;t let me take it back and give it to another! In 1837, when Millie Keith&#39;s parents sent her south to spend the winter with rich relatives, they gave her three pieces of advice: honor your parents, honor God in all you do, and give your heart to Jesus. Millie thought those things would be easy, but alone at Roselands Plantation she finds her convictions tested in ways she could not have imagined. Will the high society lifestyle of the Dinsmore family change Millie?</p><p>Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.A Sneak and a Thief I&#39;m a slave owner! Millie Keith realized with horror. I have just bought a child by promising to play the piano! Now what do I do, Lord? Was it just a month ago that Millie was standing in front of her Bible study group in Pleasant Plains, Indiana, teaching that slavery was wrong? Coming to Roselands, her Uncle Dinsmore&#39;s plantation, had seemed like an excellent way to learn the truth about the South, about slavery. I want to go home, Lord. So what if Dr. Chetwood recommended a milder climate for my lungs? He has been wrong before. This is a horrible place. No. Aunt Isabel is a horrible person. She knew the way I felt about slavery, and she used it against me quite cleverly. If I agree to play piano at Aunt Isabel&#39;s parties, then little Laylie will belong to me. If I don&#39;t buy the child, the young girl will be sent back to Meadshead to work endless hours in the fields. Her aunt&#39;s perfume hung in the hallway where she had been standing only moments before, thick as cobwebs on the damp air. Has Aunt Isabel been reading my diary? How else could she have known my thoughts about slavery? About Cousin Horace&#39;s slave? &#39;Here you are!&#39; Millie jumped at the sound of Louise&#39;s voice. &#39;Come to the nursery and tell us a story,&#39; the young girl demanded. &#39;Jonati and Miss Worth and Father are trying to get a peppermint stick out of Enna&#39;s nose, and Mother said you would tell us one.&#39; &#39;A peppermint stick? How . . . ? Never mind. I can&#39;t come right now; there is something I must do.&#39; Millie started toward her room, but Louise caught her hand. &#39;You have to. Mother said she has a headache. She said you would tell us a story. Mother said!&#39; Is this part of the bargain? Do I have to do everything Aunt Isabel orders? Millie&#39;s head was still spinning as she allowed Louise to lead her down the carpeted hall. Long before they reached the nursery, she could hear Enna&#39;s shrieks coming from Miss Worth&#39;s apartments, where Jonati had apparently carried the child. Once Millie was safely in the nursery and the door was shut, Louise went to stand beside her sister Lora. The two girls wore matching ribbons and bows. Even the pouts on their lips matched, and said very plainly that they were not happy about being left alone. Walter, who was only four, looked worried as Millie picked him up and turned to Adelaide, the oldest, who had her arms crossed and was glaring at her brother Arthur. Arthur was very busy looking innocent, which meant he was guilty of something. In the short time that Millie had been at Roselands, she had learned that Arthur only possessed two looks: one sly, which meant he was planning something, and one innocent, which meant he had just committed a crime. &#39;How did baby Enna get a peppermint stick?&#39; Millie asked. &#39;We don&#39;t know,&#39; Adelaide said, still glaring. &#39;But Arthur was in the corner with her.&#39; &#39;I didn&#39;t tell her to put it up her nose!&#39; snarled Arthur. &#39;But you didn&#39;t stop her either,&#39; said Adelaide, her frown growing darker. &#39;She puts everything up her nose!&#39; Arthur said. &#39;You know she does. Why does everyone think I am the guilty one? I&#39;m not the only one around here who gets into trouble, you know.&#39; &#39;That&#39;s enough of that, I think,&#39; Millie said. &#39;At least if you want to hear a story.&#39; &#39;I don&#39;t want a story,&#39; Arthur said defiantly. &#39;I want a book.&#39; Millie looked at him in surprise. She had never seen Arthur with a book in his hand. &#39;I want Robin Hood,&#39; he demanded. &#39;Do you have a copy in the nursery?&#39; Millie asked, forcing herself to be pleasant. &#39;No,&#39; Arthur said. &#39;It&#39;s in father&#39;s library. We&#39;ll go with you to get it.&#39; &#39;All right,&#39; Millie agreed. &#39;One chapter of Robin Hood. And then I have things I must do.&#39; Enna&#39;s screams had quieted, and Millie assumed the peppermint stick had successfully been removed. She wished that Miss Worth or Jonati would appear and take the children in hand, but the door to Miss Worth&#39;s apartment remained closed, with only sniffles and sobs seeping through. Millie sighed in resignation and led the children down the hall. Uncle Horace&#39;s library was his refuge. He had given Millie free reign of the room and permission to borrow any book, but the Persian rug on the library floor was strange territory to the Dinsmore children. Their father called them into his inner sanctum only if they were in need of discipline or reproof, and even at that, not nearly as often as he might. The smaller children stayed outside the door peeking in, but Adelaide and Arthur boldly followed Millie inside. &#39;It&#39;s a green book,&#39; Arthur said, &#39;with a picture on the cover.&#39; The description was not a great deal of help, as there were hundreds of volumes in the room. Uncle Horace had his books arranged by subject, and Millie searched the legends shelf, but to no avail. &#39;Are you sure your father has a copy of Robin Hood?&#39; Millie asked. &#39;Someone has probably taken it,&#39; Arthur said, giving Adelaide a sly look. &#39;We have a thief in the house.&#39; &#39;It wasn&#39;t me,&#39; Adelaide said. &#39;They whip thieves,&#39; Arthur said gaily. &#39;Let&#39;s read this one instead,&#39; said Millie, picking up a book of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. She had no desire to discuss anyone being whipped---after seeing Luke&#39;s back. For the crime of being a few minutes late to the fields to work, Laylie&#39;s brother had been lashed to a post and beaten until his back was nothing but raw wounds and ribbons of flesh. Millie, carrying the book, led the troop back to the nursery. She settled them on the plush carpet and began the story of Cinderella. The invitation to the prince&#39;s ball had just arrived when Jonati appeared with a puffy-eyed Enna. The baby insisted on sitting on Millie&#39;s lap for the rest of the story. Her nose was running, and Jonati kept interrupting to wipe it. When the prince and princess were wed at last, Millie gave the baby back to Jonati and excused herself to return to her room.</p><h2>Under a Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968</h2><p>The author, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, recounts her imprisonment in and escape from Auschwitz, her participation in the Prague uprising, and the death of her husband under Stalin</p><p>Heda Kovaly was born Heda Bloch in Prague in 1919, the daughter of a prosperous Jewish couple.

For centuries, Mongol tribes had warred with one another. But now, under Genghis Khan, they have united as one nation, setting their sights on a common enemy: the great, slumbering walled empire of the Chin. Genghis will lead his warriors across the Gobi Desert and into a realm his people had never seen before&#x2014;with gleaming cities, soaring walls, and canals. Laying siege to one fortress after another, he will crush each enemy in a different way&#x2014;until his army faces the ultimate test of all.<br><br>In the city of Yenking&#x2014;modern-day Beijing&#x2014;the Chin will make their final stand, setting a trap for the Mongol raiders, confident behind their towering walls. But Genghis will strike with breathtaking audacity, never ceasing until the Emperor himself is forced to kneel.</p><p>Conn Iggulden is the author of <b>Genghis: Birth of an Empire</b><i>,</i> the first novel in the series, as well as the Emperor<i> </i>novels, which chronicle the life of Julius Caesar: <b>Emperor: The Gates of Rome, Emperor: The Death of Kings, Emperor: The Field of Swords,</b> and <b>Emperor: The Gods of War</b><i>,</i> all of which are available in paperback from Dell. He is also the co-author of the bestselling nonfiction work <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i>. He lives with his wife and three children in Hertfordshire, England.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>In the summer dusk, the encampment of the Mongols stretched for miles in every direction, the great gathering still dwarfed by the plain in the shadow of the black mountain. Ger tents speckled the landscape as far as the eye could see, and around them thousands of cooking fires lit the ground. Beyond those, herds of ponies, goats, sheep, and yaks stripped the ground of grass in their constant hunger. Each dawn saw them driven away to the river and good grazing before returning to the gers. Though Genghis guaranteed the peace, tension and suspicion grew each day. None there had seen such a host before, and it was easy to feel hemmed in by the numbers. Insults imaginary and real were exchanged as all felt the pressure of living too close to warriors they did not know. In the evenings, there were many fights between the young men, despite the prohibition. Each dawn found one or two bodies of those who had tried to settle an old score or grudge. The tribes muttered among themselves while they waited to hear why they had been brought so far from their own lands.<br><br>In the center of the army of tents and carts stood the ger of Genghis himself, unlike anything seen before on the plains. Half as high again as the others, it was twice the width and built of stronger materials than the wicker lattice of the gers around it. The construction had proved too heavy to dismantle easily and was mounted on a wheeled cart drawn by eight oxen. As the night came, many hundreds of warriors directed their feet toward it, just to confirm what they had heard and marvel.<br><br>Inside, the great ger was lit with mutton-oil lamps, casting a warm light over the inhabitants and making the air thick. The walls were hung with silk war banners, but Genghis disdained any show of wealth and sat on a rough wooden bench. His brothers lay sprawled on piled horse blankets and saddles, drinking and chatting idly.<br><br>Before Genghis sat a nervous young warrior, still sweating from the long ride that had brought him amongst such a host. The men around the khan did not seem to be paying attention, but the messenger was aware that their hands were never far from their weapons. They did not seem tense or worried at his presence, and he considered that their hands might always be near a blade. His people had made their decision and he hoped the elder khans knew what they were doing.<br><br>"If you have finished your tea, I will hear the message," Genghis said.<br><br>The messenger nodded, placing the shallow cup back on the floor at his feet. He swallowed his last gulp as he closed his eyes and recited, "These are the words of Barchuk, who is khan to the Uighurs."<br><br>The conversations and laughter around him died away as he spoke, and he knew they were all listening. His nervousness grew.<br><br>" 'It is with joy that I learned of your glory, my lord Genghis Khan. We had grown weary waiting for our people to know one another and rise. The sun has risen. The river is freed of ice. You are the gurkhan, the one who will lead us all. I will dedicate my strength and knowledge to you.' "<br><br>The messenger stopped and wiped sweat from his brow. When he opened his eyes, he saw that Genghis was looking at him quizzically and his stomach tightened in fear.<br><br>"The words are very fine," Genghis said, "but where are the Uighurs? They have had a year to reach this place. If I have to fetch them . . ." He left the threat dangling.<br><br>The messenger spoke quickly. "My lord, it took months just to build the carts to travel. We have not moved from our lands in many generations. Five great temples had to be taken apart, stone by stone, each one numbered so that it could be built again. Our store of scrolls took a dozen carts by itself and cannot move quickly."<br><br>"You have writing?" Genghis asked, sitting forward with interest.<br><br>The messenger nodded without pride. "For many years now, lord. We have collected the writings of nations in the west, whenever they have allowed us to trade for them. Our khan is a man of great learning and has even copied works of the Chin and the Xi Xia."<br><br>"So I am to welcome scholars and teachers to this place?" Genghis said. "Will you fight with scrolls?"<br><br>The messenger colored as the men in the ger chuckled. "There are four thousand warriors also, my lord. They will follow Barchuk wherever he leads them."<br><br>"They will follow me, or they will be left as flesh on the grass," Genghis replied.<br><br>For a moment, the messenger could only stare, but then he dropped his eyes to the polished wooden floor and remained silent.<br><br>Genghis stifled his irritation. "You have not said when they will come, these Uighur scholars," he said.<br><br>"They could be only days behind me, lord. I left three moons ago and they were almost ready to leave. It cannot be long now, if you will have patience."<br><br>"For four thousand, I will wait," Genghis said softly, thinking. "You know the Chin writing?"<br><br>"I do not have my letters, lord. My khan can read their words."<br><br>"Do these scrolls say how to take a city made of stone?"<br><br>The messenger hesitated as he felt the sharp interest of the men around him.<br><br>"I have not heard of anything like that, lord. The Chin write about philosophy, the words of the Buddha, Confucius, and Lao Tzu. They do not write of war, or if they do, they have not allowed us to see those scrolls."<br><br>"Then they are of no use to me," Genghis snapped. "Get yourself a meal and be careful not to start a fight with your boasting. I will judge the Uighurs when they finally arrive."<br><br>The messenger bowed low before leaving the ger, taking a relieved breath as soon as he was out of the smoky atmosphere. Once more he wondered if his khan understood what he had promised with his words. The Uighur ruled themselves no longer.<br><br>Looking around at the vast encampment, the messenger saw twinkling lights for miles. At a word from the man he had met, they could be sent in any direction. Perhaps the khan of the Uighurs had not had a choice.<br><br>Hoelun dipped her cloth into a bucket and laid it on her son's brow. Temuge had always been weaker than his brothers, and it seemed an added burden that he fell sick more than Khasar or Kachiun, or Temujin himself. She smiled wryly at the thought that she must now call her son "Genghis." It meant the ocean and was a beautiful word twisted beyond its usual meaning by his ambition. He who had never seen the sea in his twenty-six years of life. Not that she had herself, of course.<br><br>Temuge stirred in his sleep, wincing as she probed his stomach with her fingers.<br><br>"He is quiet now. Perhaps I will leave for a time," Borte said. Hoelun glanced coldly at the woman Temujin had taken as a wife. Borte had given him four perfect sons and for a time Hoelun had thought they would be as sisters, or at least friends. The younger woman had once been full of life and excitement, but events had twisted her somewhere deep, where it could not be seen. Hoelun knew the way Temujin looked at the eldest boy. He did not play with little Jochi and all but ignored him. Borte had fought against the mistrust, but it had grown between them like an iron wedge into strong wood. It did not help that his three other boys had all inherited the yellow eyes of his line. Jochi's were a dark brown, as black as his hair in dim light. While Temujin doted on the others, it was Jochi who ran to his mother, unable to understand the coldness in his father's face when he looked at him. Hoelun saw the young woman glance at the door to the ger, no doubt thinking of her sons.<br><br>"You have servants to put them to bed," Hoelun chided. "If Temuge wakes, I will need you here."<br><br>As she spoke her fingers drifted over a dark knot under the skin of her son's belly, just a few fingerbreadths above the dark hair of his groin. She had seen such an injury before, when men lifted weights too heavy for them. The pain was crippling, but most of them recovered. Temuge did not have that kind of luck, and never had. He looked less like a warrior than ever as he had grown to manhood. When he slept, he had the face of a poet, and she loved him for that. Perhaps because his father would have rejoiced to see the men the others had become, she had always found a special tenderness for Temuge. He had not grown ruthless, though he had endured as much as they. She sighed to herself and felt Borte's eyes on her in the gloom.<br><br>"Perhaps he will recover," Borte said.<br><br>Hoelun winced. Her son blistered under the sun and rarely carried a blade bigger than an eating knife. She had not minded as he began to learn the histories of the tribes, taking them in with such speed that the older men were amazed at his recall. Not everyone could be skilled with weapons and horses, she told herself. She knew he hated the sneers and gibes that followed him in his work, though there were few who dared risk Genghis hearing of them. Temuge refused to mention the insults and that was a form of courage all its own. None of her sons lacked spirit.<br><br>Both women looked up as the small door of the ger opened. Hoelun frowned as she saw Kokchu enter and bow his head to them. His fierce eyes darted over the supine figure of her son, and she fought not to show her dislike, not even understanding her own reaction. There was something about the shaman that set her teeth on edge, and she had ignored the messengers he had sent. For a moment, she drew herself up, struggling between indignation and weariness.<br><br>"I did not ask for you," she said coldly.<br><br>Kokchu seemed oblivious to the tone. "I sent a slave to beg a moment with you, mother to khans. Perhaps he has not yet arrived. The whole camp is talking of your son's illness."<br><br>Hoelun felt the shaman's gaze fasten on her, waiting to be formally welcomed as she looked at T...</p><h2>Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes</h2><p>We in the west share a common narrative of world history&#x2014;that runs from the Nile Valley and Mesopotomia, through Greece and Rome and the French Revolution, to the rise of the secular state and the triumph of democracy. But our story largely omits a whole civilization that until quite recently saw itself at the center of world history, and whose citizens shared an entirely different narrative for a thousand years.<p><i>In Destiny Disrupted</i>, Tamim Ansary tells the rich story of world history as the Islamic world saw it, from the time of Mohammed to the fall of the Ottoman Empire and beyond. He clarifies why our civilizations grew up oblivious to each other, what happened when they intersected, and how the Islamic world was affected by its slow recognition that Europe&#x2014;a place it long perceived as primitive and disorganized&#x2014;had somehow hijacked destiny. Entertaining and enlightening, <i>Destiny Disrupted</i> also offers a vital perspective on current conflicts.</p></p><p><b>Tamim Ansary</b> is the author of the memoir <i>West of Kabul, East of New York</i>, co-author with Farah Ahmadi of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Other Side of the Sky</i>, and has been a major contributing writer to several secondary school history textbooks. Ansary is director of the San Francisco Writers Workshop. He writes for Encarta.com, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Salon</i>, <i>Alternet</i>, <i>Edutopia</i>, <i>Parade</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and other publications.This is the audiobook about Islam you&#39;ve been waiting for. Ansary&#39;s presentation of Islamic history, ideas, and values, explained from an American point of view, makes clear material that can seem opaque in a lengthy textbook or lecture series. Ansary&#39;s strong, warm voice adds enormously to his powerful discourse. His matter-of-fact tone prevents the listener from being overwhelmed by his apparently effortless authority regarding the early Khalifa, Mongol dynasties, Liebnitz, and 9/11. His slight Afghan accent makes his presentation more personal. Only the numerous, and absolutely necessary, Arabic words can be a challenge for the listener.

Since being introduced in the nineteenth century, slabs have become ubiquitous and are today as popular as ever.</p><p>Slabs come from a genre of Egyptian typefaces (some of the leading slabs are called Cairo and Sphinx) brought back to France by Napoleon and marketed in specimen sheets and books as representing a glorious heritage brought to the present. In 1931, Morris Fuller Benton created the Stymie typeface, a reworking of a slab serif type popular in Europe at that time: Memphis. The IBM logo is one of the most famous slab serif marks. The serifs were often exaggerated so they would not result in simply beautiful letterforms but would be functionally superior to other faces.

The event--the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima I of course knew about; like all children of the post-World War II generation, my classmates and I had learned about it in elementary school.</p><p>But the fact that the man who dropped the bomb--the pilot who flew the <i>Enola Gay</i> to Japan, who carried out the single most violent act in the history of mankind and thus brought World War II to an end--the fact that he lived quietly in the same town where I had grown up . . . that piece of knowledge came from my father.</p><p>It was never stated in an especially dramatic way. My dad would come home from work--from downtown Columbus, in central Ohio--and say: "I was buying some shirts today, and Paul Tibbets was in the next aisle, buying ties."</p><p>They never met; my father never said a word to him. I sensed that my father might have been a little reluctant, maybe even a touch embarrassed; he had been a soldier with an infantry division, Tibbets had been a combat pilot, all these years had passed since the war and now here they both were, two all-but-anonymous businessmen in a sedate, landlocked town in a country at peace . . . what was my dad supposed to say? How was he supposed to begin the conversation?</p><p>Yet there was always a certain sound in his voice at the dinner table. "Paul Tibbets was in the next aisle buying ties . . . " The sound in my dad's voice told me--as if I needed reminding--that the story of his life had reached its most indelible and meaningful moments in the years of the war, the years before I was born.</p><p>Those dinner-table conversations were long ago, though; they were in the years when my dad was still vital, in good health, in the prime of his adult years, not yet ready to leave the world. I had all but forgotten the conversations--at least the specifics of them, other than the occasional mentions of Tibbets.</p><p>Now my dad was dying. We had dinner in his bedroom--he would not, it would turn out, again be able to sit in a chair and eat after this night--and the next morning I told him that I had somewhere to go and that I would be back in a few hours, and I went to find Paul Tibbets. Something told me that it was important.</p></p><h2>Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories</h2><p>In this collection of stories about small-town life, Dale takes a step toward manhood and Darlene sets off for Minneapolis to begin a new life</p><p>Garrison Keillor lives in St Paul, Minnesota, home of A Prairie Home Companion, his radio show that has been on the air since 1974. He wrote and appeared in Robert Altman&#39;s final film, A Prairie Home Companion and is the author of many books including the Lake Wobegon novels, which include Lake Wobegon Days, Pontoon and Pilgrims."Home," in Keillor's fictional world, is Lake Wobegon (the "Gateway to Central Minnesota"), which the radio humorist introduced in print in Lake Wobegon Days. This collection of stories set in Lake Wobegon is taken from monologues performed on A Prairie Home Companion, Keillor's radio show; each one chronicles some kind of leave-taking or homecoming: trips to Minneapolis, high school graduations, attending the Minnesota State Fair, a waitress quitting her job at the Chatterbox Cafe, a boy joining the army, Father Emil retiring from Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility, family members returning to Lake Wobegon for Christmas. In the last story, from Keillor's final show, the storyteller bids farewell to his beloved hometown. Keillor has a rare gift for celebrating and finding humor in commonplace events, and his affection for his characters and for small-town life shines through. These short narratives survive the transition from performance to print beautifully; they are spare, artfully crafted vignettes that will move readers as well as entertain them. Some tales are wildly hilarious, others gently poignantbut all are simply wonderful. 750,000 first printing; BOMC and QPBC main selections; first serial to the Atlantic. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Barneys New York</h2><p>As Sarah Jessica Parker once told Vanity Fair, "If you're a nice person and you work hard, you get to go shopping at Barneys.

Both wanted to revolutionize fashion in a way no one had in decades. They shook the establishment out of its bourgeois, minimalist stupor with daring, sexy designs. They turned out landmark collections in mesmerizing, theatrical shows that retailers and critics still gush about and designers continue to reference.<br><br>Their approach to fashion was wildly different&#x2014;Galliano began as an illustrator, McQueen as a Savile Row tailor. Galliano led the way with his sensual bias-cut gowns and his voluptuous hourglass tailoring, which he presented in romantic storybook-like settings. McQueen, though nearly ten years younger than Galliano, was a brilliant technician and a visionary artist who brought a new reality to fashion, as well as an otherworldly beauty. For his first official collection at the tender age of twenty-three, McQueen did what few in fashion ever achieve: he invented a new silhouette, the Bumster.<br><br>They had similar backgrounds: sensitive, shy gay men raised in tough London neighborhoods, their love of fashion nurtured by their doting mothers. Both struggled to get their businesses off the ground, despite early critical success. But by 1997, each had landed a job as creative director for couture houses owned by French tycoon Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH.<br>&nbsp;<br>Galliano&#x2019;s and McQueen&#x2019;s work for Dior and Givenchy and beyond not only influenced fashion; their distinct styles were also reflected across the media landscape. With their help, luxury fashion evolved from a clutch of small, family-owned businesses into a $280 billion-a-year global corporate industry. Executives pushed the designers to meet increasingly rapid deadlines. For both Galliano and McQueen, the pace was unsustainable. In 2010, McQueen took his own life three weeks before his womens' wear show.<br><br>The same week that Galliano was fired,&nbsp;<i>Forbes</i>&nbsp;named Arnault the fourth richest man in the world. Two months later, Kate Middleton wore a McQueen wedding gown, instantly making the house the world&#x2019;s most famous fashion brand, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened a wildly successful McQueen retrospective, cosponsored by the corporate owners of the McQueen brand.

The oldest detectable territorial division in Great Britain, the Debatable Land served as a buffer between Scotland and England. It was once the bloodiest region in the country, fought over by Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, and James V. After most of its population was slaughtered or deported, it became the last part of Great Britain to be brought under the control of the state. Today, it has vanished from the map and its boundaries are matters of myth and generational memories.</p><p>Under the spell of a powerful curiosity, Robb began a journey&#x2015;on foot, by bicycle, and into the past&#x2015;that would uncover lost towns and roads, and unlock more than one discovery of major historical significance. These personal and scholarly adventures reveal a tale that spans Roman, Medieval, and present-day Britain.</p><p>Rich in detail and epic in scope,&nbsp;<em>The Debatable Land</em>&nbsp;takes us from a time when neither England nor Scotland existed to the present day, when contemporary nationalism and political turmoil threaten to unsettle the cross-border community once more. With his customary charm, wit, and literary grace, Graham Robb proves the Debatable Land to be a crucial, missing piece in the puzzle of British history.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Best-selling author Graham Robb was born in Manchester in 1958 and is a former Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.

Its author spent 40 years combing historical records and interviewing dozens of descendants of pioneer settlers and Native Americans who shared oral traditions that have been passed down through generations. <p>What emerges is history as it has never been told before. A history of conquistadors and fur trappers, of merchants and missionaries. The history of an Indian war that was one of the longest and bloodiest conflicts ever fought on American soil, but which for political and economic reasons was covered up for decades. Above all, the history of &#x201c;those first settlers of the Ochoco&#x2014;men, woman, and children&#x2014;who were left to wander and starve in a land they thought belonged to them through eternity, a people who in their final agony cried out: `Nimma ne-umpu!'&#x2014;`We too are human!&#x2019; </p><p>Gale Ontko tells this story with compassion and grace, in a style that combines the precision of the scholar with the vigor and drama of the novelist. The five volumes comprise nearly 2500 printed book pages and have been described by some as the most factual writing by any author on the history of the Shoshoni People. </p><p>Volume III covers the period between 1860 and 1869 when rich deposits of gold were discovered in eastern Oregon, and the citizens of the Willamette Valley were out to claim their share at any cost. Shoshoni dog soldiers were equally determined that they keep to their side of the Cascade barrier. War was officially declared. The opposing forces went for each other&#x2019;s throats locked in a death struggle that seemed endless. The crashing crescendo of thunder was accompanied by lightning strikes of destruction which ricocheted into four western states&#x2014;and the military campaign they thought would last but a few weeks stretched into years. In flashing raids, Shoshoni dog soldiers humiliated the Oregon Cavalry, taking a deadly toll on mining settlements, homesteads, stagecoaches and wagon trains. It would take a battle-hardened army baptized in the carnage of the Civil War four years to bring the Shoshoni to their knees: an aggressor with unlimited resources pitted against a foe that was undermanned, undernourished and outgunned&#x2014;but desperately fighting for survival. Volume III is the story of the first violent Shoshoni outbreak, which would again erupt in the 1870s.</p></p><p>Mix together equal portions of the intellectual curiosity and organizational abilities of Benjamin Franklin and the steely determination of Ulysses S. Grant, let simmer in the Ochocos of Central Oregon for nearly seven decades and the product is Gale Ontko, the writer of Thunder Over the Ochoco. <p> In most respects this is a man who became an author because of circumstances rather than desire. He grew up in the Ochoco Valley area east of Prineville and unlike most Oregonians has spent his life on the land. His employment as a BLM fire management supervisor took him into back country for long stretches of time and the Indians of the area got to know him so well they finally gave him an Indian name of his own. </p><p> It all began innocently enough when he realized that native Americans&#x2014;except for brief reports of an encounter on the Little Big Horn&#x2014;had been ignored in the writing of American history as totally as our other non-European minorities. He began to talk with Indians, take notes and enter the world of historical research until one day he felt he was able to add something to what had been written about early days in the Northwest. His other motivation was an increasing belief that the rather desolate land mass of the Ochoco had itself profoundly influenced the history of the region and had an interesting story of its own to be told, if someone was willing to do the work of putting it in proper order. </p><p> To a greater extent than is usually the case his writing is a mirror reflection of the man himself. It is said that only the very rich and/or those who live alone can afford the luxury of very strong attitudes and convictions. Gale has lived by himself for many years and the two special gifts of that experience which he brings to his writing are an iron-willed determination to be sure that he has the facts right and an incredible degree of patience. The first has led him to an extraordinary depth of research. There was no solid backlog of Indian data, because the Shoshoni had no written language. So he listened carefully to the oral histories of all the principal tribes and then sought verification by crosschecking contemporary written materials. He has known that his writing breaks new ground and has been determined that regardless of the amount of research required that it stand solid against all inquiry. His remarkable patience has let him continue for years the assembling of his facts before doing the writing. </p><p> His book has the refreshing directness and, when necessary, the bluntness that back country people still retain and which their urban cousins have largely abandoned. He has made every effort possible to learn the truth about the people who made the history about which he writes and then to state it. Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company is not likely to send him a thank-you note, genteel readers may feel they could get along with fewer details of the way the trapper brigades lived and any descendants of Protestant missionaries to Oregon might well consider putting out a contract on this man. The good news is that when most readers finish this book they are very likely to say, &#x201c;I had no idea non-fiction could be so interesting.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Mandie and the Schoolhouse&#39;s Secret (Mandie, Book 26)</h2><p>Mandy and Celia try to trace the descendants of the righful owners of the pirate treasure they find in the schoolhouse basement</p><p>Lois began her first Mandie story when she was only eleven years old.

What has gone unnoticed about the much-researched life of Washington is that he was in fact a consummate politician, as historian John Ferling shows in this revealing and provocative new book. As leader of the Continental Army, Washington's keen political savvy enabled him not only to outwit superior British forces, but--even more challenging--to manage the fractious and intrusive Continental Congress. Despite dire setbacks early in the war, Washington deftly outmaneuvered rival generals and defused dissent from officers below him, ending the war with the status of a national icon. His carefully burnished reputation allowed Washington, as president, to lead the country under the guise of non-partisanship for almost all of his eight years in office. Washington, Ferling argues, was not only one of America's most adroit politicians, he was easily the most successful of all time--so successful, in fact, that he is no longer thought of as having been political.</p></p><p><p>John Ferling is Professor Emeritus of History at the State University of West Georgia. A leading authority on American Revolutionary history, he has appeared in many documentaries and has written numerous books, including <i>Almost a Miracle: The American Victory in the War for Independence</i>, <i>Adams vs. Jefferson: The Tumultuous Election of 1800</i>, <i>The First of Men: A Life of George Washington</i>, <i>Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in the American Revolution</i>, and the award-winning <i>A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic</i>.</p>The author claims not to have written a biography of the first U.S. president, but rather an examination of his politics. Much of the book&#39;s language comes from letters, speeches, and newspapers of the eighteenth century, making the vocabulary and style seem stilted and foreign. One can, however, still learn a great deal about Washington&#39;s military mind, his demeanor, and how his contemporaries viewed him. Norman Dietz narrates as many nonfiction lovers prefer: no frills or embellishments, just words off the page. His pace never varies from medium-slow, allowing listeners to hear and understand every word. As some audio readers also prefer, his plain-vanilla narration gradually moves to the background, allowing the focus to stay on the vast amount of historical information. J.A.H. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation</h2><p><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Jennifer Szalai,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;�&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i>� NPR �&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This absorbing and important book recounts the titanic struggle over the implications of the Civil War amid the impeachment of a defiant and temperamentally erratic American president.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Soul of America</i></b><br><br> When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated and Vice-President Andrew Johnson became &#x201c;the Accidental President,&#x201d; it was a dangerous time in America. Congress was divided over how the Union should be reunited: when and how the secessionist South should regain full status, whether former Confederates should be punished, and when and whether black men should be given the vote. Devastated by war and resorting to violence, many white Southerners hoped to restore a pre&#x2013;Civil War society, if without slavery, and the pugnacious Andrew Johnson seemed to share their goals. With the unchecked power of executive orders, Johnson ignored Congress, pardoned rebel leaders, promoted white supremacy, opposed civil rights, and called Reconstruction unnecessary. It fell to Congress to stop the American president who acted like a king.<br><br> With profound insights and making use of extensive research, Brenda Wineapple dramatically evokes this pivotal period in American history, when the country was rocked by the first-ever impeachment of a sitting American president. And she brings to vivid life the extraordinary characters who brought that impeachment forward: the willful Johnson and his retinue of advocates&#x2014;including complicated men like Secretary of State William Seward&#x2014;as well as the equally complicated visionaries committed to justice and equality for all, like Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner, Frederick Douglass, and Ulysses S.

No one is quite sure which word, &#x201c;angels&#x201d; or &#x201c;ages,&#x201d; Stanton uttered, but each works poignantly well.<br><br>Many were likely surprised by Stanton&#x2019;s sobs. And his eloquence. Most knew him as hard, implacable, and gruff. He barked out orders to his inferiors, he kept the lamps burning in the War Department all through the night, and he&#x2019;d organized the Union army with precision. His long beard trailed down to the middle of his chest, as if he had no time to bother with a barber, and he took exercise by standing at his high desk for as many as fifteen hours a day. He was so devoted to the War Department, in fact, that people were likely not surprised, three years later, when Stanton assumed center stage during the impeachment controversy.<br><br>Of all people, though, President Lincoln might have understood best what motivated his secretary of war. For if Stanton had ever unburdened himself, it would have been to his chief executive. These two men&#x2014;Lincoln, tall and lean and genial; Stanton, shorter, squatter, and far more volatile&#x2014;were friends. Wrapped in a plaid shawl and with his hat pulled down over his forehead, during the war Lincoln would walk over to the War Department and sit in the small room next to Stanton&#x2019;s office, where Lincoln kept a desk. He and Stanton waited, each of them anxious, for telegraph dispatches from the many fields of battle. Sometimes they relaxed together, occasionally driving north of the city to the leafy retreat known as the retired soldiers&#x2019; home, where the secretary of war, like Lincoln and his family, escaped from summer heat. These men truly loved each other, said Representative Henry Dawes, who knew them both.<br><br>Edwin Stanton had also shared with Lincoln grief of a more personal sort. Like Lincoln&#x2019;s boy Willie, Stanton&#x2019;s young son had also died in 1862. But Stanton mainly sought relief in work, and unlike Lincoln, always appeared to be on guard, shouldering sorrows that acquaintances only sometimes glimpsed. After Stanton&#x2019;s father, a well-liked physician, had died suddenly in 1827, the thirteen-year-old Stanton took charge of the Steubenville, Ohio, household that included his mother, his brother, and his two sisters. He completed only one year at Kenyon College but studied law in the office of his guardian, becoming the sort of brilliant attorney on whom nothing was lost&#x2014;and who left nothing to chance. He prepared cases with a meticulous, even furious, attention to detail, and he argued with aggressive often insolent vigor. He might insult a witness or a judge, or tell the opposing counsel to quit whining. A stocky, broad-shouldered man with brown, sharp eyes under steel-rimmed spectacles that he often wiped, he was not an easy person to like, and there were a great many people who did, in fact, dislike him.<br><br>As Henry Dawes would recall, Edwin Stanton was also &#x201c;prone to despond.&#x201d; When he was twenty-two, he married Mary Lamson, and after the burial of their firstborn daughter, Stanton disinterred the child and placed her remains in a metal box that he kept on the mantelpiece. When his wife died not long afterward&#x2014;Stanton was thirty&#x2014;he stopped eating and sleeping and in the night would rush from room to room, lamp in hand, crying out, &#x201c;Where is Mary?&#x201d; Not long after that, Stanton, learning that his brother Darwin had cut his own throat, ran to Darwin&#x2019;s house, where blood was pooling on the floorboards. He then raced out into the freezing cold in such a hurry that friends, fearing for his life, coaxed him back and stayed with him until he calmed down. Stanton took responsibility for Darwin&#x2019;s family but never seemed to recover. &#x201c;I feel indifferent to the present, careless of the future&#x2014;&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;in a state of bewilderment the end of which is hidden.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet Stanton&#x2019;s law practice was thriving. He moved to Pittsburgh, where he argued on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania before the Supreme Court to prevent a bridge from being built across the Ohio River because, Stanton claimed, it would prevent tall steamboats from traveling under it and thereby restrict interstate commerce. The case dragged on for almost a decade, and though Stanton technically lost, steamboat travel continued. Then in 1856, Stanton married Ellen Hutchison, a woman from a wealthy Pittsburgh family and Stanton&#x2019;s junior by sixteen years. Though Lincoln&#x2019;s secretary John Hay described her &#x201c;as white and cold and motionless as marble, whose rare smiles seemed to pain her,&#x201d; the marriage seems to have been happy in spite of Stanton&#x2019;s working long hours&#x2014;and his even longer absences.<br><br>Attorney General Jeremiah S. Black had appointed Stanton as special U.S. counsel to inspect alleged Mexican land grants in California. During his protracted stay in the West&#x2014;almost a year&#x2014;Stanton immediately learned Spanish to gather the documents scattered througout the state, or that were allegedly lost, and he exposed several bogus land grant deals, one of which actually claimed ownership of San Francisco. In early 1859, he returned to Washington, where he had moved his family, and built an impressive brick house, three stories high, on the north side of K Street. He was a prosperous, sought-after man in a country about to break apart.<br><br>He was also involved in legal spectacles, serving on the defense team for Daniel Sickles, the Democratic congressman from New York who had recently shot and killed District Attorney Philip Barton Key. There was no doubt as to Sickles&#x2019; guilt, but the trial was something of a circus, featuring two of Washington&#x2019;s well-known political creatures, the flamboyant Sickles and the deceased Philip Key. Sickles had served as James Buchanan&#x2019;s secretary when Buchanan was minister to the Court of St. James during the Franklin Pierce administration. The good-looking District Attorney Key was the son of Francis Scott Key, composer of &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#x201d; He also happened to be the lover of Sickles&#x2019; wife.<br><br>Along with six other lawyers, Edwin Stanton defended Sickles before a packed Washington courtroom eager for salacious details about the affair. Sickles admitted he&#x2019;d killed Key but pleaded not guilty by reason of &#x201c;temporary insanity,&#x201d; the first time such a plea had been offered in the United States. Sickles had to be insane, his lawyers contended; what man wouldn&#x2019;t be driven crazy by his wife&#x2019;s infidelity? The all-male jury voted to acquit Sickles, another triumph for Edwin Stanton.<br><br>The next year, 1860, during the last days of his presidency, James Buchanan reshuffled his cabinet and appointed Stanton as attorney general. But unlike President Buchanan, who dithered over how to handle the threat of secession, Stanton was firm. America was the only democracy in the world, Stanton asserted more than once, and he was committed to its preservation&#x2014;even if that meant leaking information to Republican Senator William H. Seward about President Buchanan&#x2019;s intentions toward a besieged Fort Sumter in 1860. Little wonder that among his enemies, Stanton earned a reputation as disingenuous, if not downright duplicitous.</p><h2>Pulp Fashion: The Art of Isabelle De Borchgrave</h2><p>The intricately handcrafted paper fashions of Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave will astound readers with their artistry, creativity, and resemblance to the finest couture designs.

When the great blizzard of 1888 crippled the entire northeast, a solution had to be found. Two brothers from one of the nation's great families-Henry Melville Whitney of Boston and William Collins Whitney of New York-pursued the dream of his city digging America's first subway, and the great race was on. The competition between Boston and New York played out in an era not unlike our own, one of economic upheaval, life-changing innovations, class warfare, bitter political tensions, and the question of America's place in the world.</p><p><i>The Race Underground</i> is peopled with the famous, like Boss Tweed, Grover Cleveland and Thomas Edison, and the not-so-famous, from brilliant engineers to the countless "sandhogs" who shoveled, hoisted and blasted their way into the earth's crust, sometimes losing their lives in the construction of the tunnels. Doug Most chronicles the science of the subway, looks at the centuries of fears people overcame about traveling underground and tells a story as exciting as any ever ripped from the pages of U.S. history. The Race Underground is a great American saga of two rival American cities, their rich, powerful and sometimes corrupt interests, and an invention that changed the lives of millions.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, February 2014:</strong> While reading Doug Most&#x2019;s <em>The Race Underground: Boston, New York, and the Incredible Rivalry That Built America's First Subway</em>, it quickly becomes apparent that the 19th-century world was a dirty, slow-moving place. Not only were the modern cities of the world filled with horses, they were filled with their excrement, along with all the billowing smoke and caked dirt that modern industry of the time could produce. <em>The Race Underground</em> offers a colorful and informative description of that bygone era. Famous names surface throughout the book--men like Andrew Carnegie, Boss Tweed, and Thomas Edison. But Most ties the story together through two less famous, more essential brothers: Henry Whitney of Boston and William Whitney of New York. When the city of London built the first subway, it might have seemed only a matter of time before one was constructed in a major U.S. city. The truth is much more complicated and fascinating than that. Most shows how getting through government intransigence and payola was as daunting as getting a hole carved through the earth. It was a time when great minds turned themselves toward bettering the world they lived in, but in some ways the past seems all too familiar. <em>--Chris Schluep</em></p><p>Doug Most is the deputy managing editor for features at <i>The Boston Globe</i>.

The choice was understandable, for Hunter was both widely acclaimed and greatly feared.<br>&nbsp;<br>From humble origins, John Hunter rose to become the most famous anatomist and surgeon of the eighteenth century. In an age when operations were crude, extremely painful, and often fatal, he rejected medieval traditions to forge a revolution in surgery founded on pioneering scientific experiments. Using the knowledge he gained from countless human dissections, Hunter worked to improve medical care for both the poorest and the best-known figures of the era&#x2014;including Sir Joshua Reynolds and the young Lord Byron.<br>&nbsp;<br>An insatiable student of all life-forms, Hunter was also an expert naturalist. He kept exotic creatures in his country menagerie and dissected the first animals brought back by Captain Cook from Australia. Ultimately his research led him to expound highly controversial views on the age of the earth, as well as equally heretical beliefs on the origins of life more than sixty years before Darwin published his famous theory.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although a central figure of the Enlightenment, Hunter&#x2019;s tireless quest for human corpses immersed him deep in the sinister world of body snatching. He paid exorbitant sums for stolen cadavers and even plotted successfully to steal the body of Charles Byrne, famous in his day as the &#x201c;Irish giant.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Knife Man</i>, Wendy Moore unveils John Hunter&#x2019;s murky and macabre world&#x2014;a world characterized by public hangings, secret expeditions to dank churchyards, and gruesome human dissections in pungent attic rooms. This is a fascinating portrait of a remarkable pioneer and his determined struggle to haul surgery out of the realms of meaningless superstitious ritual and into the dawn of modern medicine.</p><p>The vivid, often gruesome portrait of the 18th century pioneering surgeon and father of modern medicine, John Hunter. <br>In the gothic horror story, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the house of the genial doctor turned fiend is reputedly based on the home of the 18th century surgeon and anatomist John Hunter. The choice was understandable, for Hunter combined an altruistic determination to advance scientific knowledge with dark dealings that brought him into daily contact with the sinister Georgian underworld. In 18th century London, Hunter was a man both acclaimed and feared. <br>John Hunter revolutionized surgical practice through his groundbreaking experiments. Driven by an insatiable curiosity, he dissected thousands of human bodies, using the knowledge he gained to improve medical care for countless patients, including some very illustrious people, Joshua Reynolds and Lord Byron among them. He was appointed Surgeon Extraordinary to King George III. <br>In The Knife Man, Wendy Moore unveils a world characterized by hangings at the Tyburn Tree, by gruesome expeditions to dank churchyards, and by countless human dissections in attic rooms - large sums were paid to body-snatchers for stolen corpses which were delivered to Hunter's back door. <br>Meticulously researched, it is also a fascinating portrait of a scientist determined to haul surgery out of the realm of superstition and into the dawn of modern medicine.Wendy Moore is a writer and a journalist.

After the violent death of her father, in which she is complicit, Margo takes to the Stark River in her boat, with only a few supplies and a biography of Annie Oakley, in search of her vanished mother. But the river, Margo's childhood paradise, is a dangerous place for a young woman traveling alone, and she must be strong to survive, using her knowledge of the natural world and her ability to look unsparingly into the hearts of those around her.

Bonnie Jo Campbell's tough and confident <em>Once Upon a River</em>, about a runaway teenager on Michigan's waterways, pays due homage to the bard of the Mississippi, but the novel also tells its own captivating story&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sam Sacks, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred Review. A dramatic and rhapsodic American odyssey. A female Huckleberry Finn. A wild-child-to-caring-woman story as intricately meshed with the natural life of the river as a myth. ...she conveys all that Margo does, thinks, and feels with transfixing sensuous precision, from the jolt of a gun to the muscle burn of rowing a boat against the current to the weight of a man. From killing and skinning game to falling in with outlaws and finding refuge with kind if irascible strangers, Margo&#x2019;s earthy education and the profound complexities of her timeless dilemmas are exquisitely rendered and mesmerizingly suspenseful. A glorious novel destined to entrance and provoke.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>Politics Of The Mind: Marxism and Mental Distress</h2><p>Mental ill health has become one of the key &#39;public issues&#39; of the 21st century. According to the World Health Organization, depression currently affects 350 million people. Politics of the Mind: Marxism and Mental Distress looks at the link between the economic and political system under which we live - capitalism - and the enormously high levels of mental ill-health which we see in the world today. The book ends by looking ahead to a world driven not by the demands of profit but on based on meeting human needs - a world which the Marxist psychoanalyst Erich Fromm called &#39;a sane society&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>French Lessons: Adventures with Knife, Fork, and Corkscrew</h2><p>From Peter Mayle, a joyous exploration and celebration of the infinite gastronomic pleasures of France.<br><br>Ranging far from his adopted Provence, Mayle now travels to every corner of the country, armed with knife, fork, and corkscrew. He takes us to tiny, out-of-the-way restaurants, starred Michelin wonders, local village markets, annual festivals, and blessed vineyards.<br><br>We visit the Foire aux Escargots at Martigny-les-Bains a whole weekend devoted to the lowly but revered snail. We observe the Marathon du Medoc, where runners passing through the great vineyards of Bordeaux refresh themselves en route with tastings of red wine (including Chateau Lafite-Rothschild!). There is a memorable bouillabaisse in a beachside restaurant on the Cute d'Azur. And we go on a search for the perfect chicken that takes us to a fair in Bourg-en-Bresse.<br><br>There is a Catholic mass in the village of Ri-cherenches, a sacred event at which thanks are given for the aromatic, mysterious, and breathtakingly expensive black truffle. We learn which is the most pungent cheese in France (it's in Normandy), witness a debate on the secret of the perfect omelette, and pick up a few luscious recipes along the way. There is even an appreciation and celebration of an essential tool for any serious food-lover in France, the <i>Michelin Guide</i>.<br><br>"Here we have all the glory and pleasure of the French table in the most satisfying book yet from the toujours delightfully entertaining"<br>--Peter Mayle.<br></p><p>Peter Mayle, author of the bestselling <i>A Year in Provence</i> has done it again--but differently. Traveling this time beyond his adopted Provence throughout France, the food and travel writer has produced <i>French Lessons</i>, a celebration of many of that country's gastronomic joys. Whether pursuing La Foire de Fromages, the annual cheese fair at Livarot; a Burgundian marathon offering runners M�doc refreshment; or a village truffle mass that concludes with a heady <i>d�gustation</i> of the newly blessed tuber, Mayle takes his readers in hand and shows all. Wide-eyed yet knowing, ever affable but with a touch of mischief, he's an ideal companion, the best possible narrator of his lively food adventures.<p> Mayle's gastronomic baptism occurs when, as a 19-year-old, he dines for the first time in France. "At the first mouthful of French bread and French butter," he writes, "my taste buds, dormant until then, went into spasm." The paroxysm leads to serious food-and-wine perambulations--and, finally, to chapters including "The Thigh-Taster of Vitel" (a frog-eating fete); "Slow Food" (snail love in Martigny les Bains) and "The Guided Stomach" (an investigation of the Michelin Guide restaurant inspection), among others. Readers are also present for a debate on the secret of the perfect omelet; a search for the best possible chicken in Bourg-en-Bresse; and a visit to a St. Tropez restaurant notable for its scantily clad habitu�s. Those familiar with Mayle's work, and those yet to discover it, are in for a treat. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>4 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mama Day</h2><p>Miranda Day, matriarch of an island off the coast of the U.S., fights a mortal combat with dark forces that threaten her great-niece, Cocoa, who has married and gone to the mainland</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

In less than twenty hours, thousands would light fireworks to herald the coming of a new century, the promise of a new beginning. Just west of Del Rio, on the Guajia Bay, nothing so remarkable heralded the departure of one young life and the end of innocence for another.<br>Down a dark, narrow road, the six inhabitants of a double-wide mobile home were fast asleep at 4:30 A.M. The man outside the residence first tried to trip the lock on the back door with his knife blade, but failed. The family dog started barking in the pen. He let the black rottweiler smell his hand and patted him on the head until the animal was quiet. He removed the screen from the window above the air conditioner and pushed up on the sash, but the latch lock was drawn, holding the pane in place.<br>He moved on panther feet to the front of the house. The window to 14-year-old Justin Harris&#x2019; room was raised to the welcome coolness of a mild December. Outside, the open window was an invitation to the man lurking in the shadows. He removed that screen and set it off to the side. Beneath his makeshift entryway, a large metal tub rested. He stepped up on its edge, unaware that in the dark water below his foot, two ill-tempered snapping turtles waited for him to slip. From his perch, he pushed the sash up a bit farther until he created an opening large enough for entry. Carefully, he threw one leg up over the windowsill and into the room. He paused, his ears tuned to catch the slightest noise. He hoisted the other leg into the room and eased himself down to the floor.<br>Justin, blind from birth, thought one of the girls was messing with him again, and said, &#x201c;Will you all stop coming into my room?&#x201d; then went back to sleep.<br>The intruder walked into the next bedroom and struck his lighter. There was a very small girl sleeping on the bed, 7-year-old Marque Surles. Her heart-shaped face looked even more innocent in repose than it did by day&#x2014;nose smooshed in the pillow, delicate eyelashes feathered on its case. Her body curled up in a loose, comfortable ball. He stared at her in the flickering light. Then, he turned away.<br>He walked down the hall to the other end of the trailer. Spinning the ridged wheel on his lighter again, he saw a woman, Crystal Harris, and a young girl, 12-year-old Lori Harris, fast asleep. He touched the woman on the leg. She did not stir. He looked down at her long hair splayed across the pillow, at the curves of her body undulating beneath the covers. He shook his head and stepped away.<br>He went back down the hall to explore the one remaining bedroom. Stepping across the threshold, all he heard was the quiet flow of breath from the two occupants in the room. He inhaled a heady smell: part sweaty child, part air freshener, part blooming female adolescence.<br>He pulled the door closed behind him. In the top bunk, 10-year-old Krystal Surles stirred, and he froze in his tracks. No thread of light penetrated the room. He was unable to identify the source of the noise. His right hand squeezed the knife handle until it left a deep impression on his palm. In two steps, he was leaning over 13-year-old Kaylene &#x201c;Katy&#x201d; Harris on the lower level of the bed. &#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; he hissed into her ear. He lay down next to her and held one hand to her trembling throat while his other hand wielded a hideous twelve-inch boning knife.<br>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br>Without responding, he slit her shorts. He cut her panties. He sliced her bra in two. Then he returned the knife to the terrified child&#x2019;s throat while his free hand danced across her small body. She jerked free, tumbling out of bed on the side that was closest to the wall.<br>She shouted, &#x201c;Go get Mama!&#x201d; as she surged toward the door. But he was already there blocking her escape. His knife stabbed, drawing first blood.<br>&#x201c;Look, you cut me.&#x201d;<br>He flipped on the light and looked at the fresh wound on her arm, and pulled her toward him. Above, Krystal awoke with a start, peering through the slats of the bunk. First she saw Katy; a hairy hand was clasped over her friend&#x2019;s mouth. Then, her worst nightmare came true: she saw him&#x2014;the monster under the bed lived! He stood behind Katy, holding a wicked-looking knife to her throat. As the 13-year-old struggled, Krystal looked in her eyes. She received an urgent message that was as loud and clear as if spoken: &#x201c;Do not move.&#x201d;<br>Without warning, the knife sliced. A helpless Krystal watched as a long red streak of blood raced across Katy&#x2019;s neck. The knife pulled back and cut again, deepening the wound. The 13-year-old twisted away, clutched at a poster on the wall and pulled it down with her. She fell to the floor, gagging, choking, gasping for air as she drowned in a profusion of her own blood. He leaned over her, stabbing her stomach, her chest, her arms until he was certain he had completed what he had begun.<br>The intruder then turned to the top bunk where he saw Krystal for the first time.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be quiet. I promise. I won&#x2019;t say nothing. I&#x2019;m not making a noise. It&#x2019;s Katy, not me,&#x201d; she begged.<br>In response, the silent stranger brought the menacing knife toward her throat. Her jerking hands flew up to that vulnerable part of her small eighty-pound frame in a valiant attempt to defend it from assault. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hurt me,&#x201d; she whimpered.<br>He answered her pathetic plea with a cold command: &#x201c;Move your hands.&#x201d; When she did not comply, he brushed them away and brought the boning knife across her throat with sufficient violence to slice her windpipe in two. Krystal uttered not a sound. She lay motionless, smelling the acrid scent of blood and the pungent odor of her own fear. She fought back the urge to flee, instinct warning her that any sign of life would ensure instant death. The bearded, long-haired nightmare turned off the bedroom lights and left the room.<br>Still, Krystal did not move. Her heart pounded with anxiety, dreading that the man would return. When she could bear it no longer, she got out of the bed on the side next to the wall. She pushed on the window there, but could not open it. Feeling her way with her hands, she moved to the end of the bed, identified her suitcase by touch and stumbled over the limp, bloody body of her best friend. Without thinking, Krystal lay down next to her. She patted the other girl&#x2019;s leg with pitiful tenderness, hoping she could make the horrible noises stop. Katy showed no sign of receiving the comfort her desperate friend wanted to impart. Her body, ravaged by sixteen stab wounds and two severe lacerations, was unable to respond.<br>Krystal thought she heard a car start and drive away in the distance. She felt her way to the bedroom door, banging her toes hard into the ladder to the bunk bed that had fallen in her path. She moved it out of the way and exited the room. Help was just down the hall, but she did not know it. Her thoughts were consumed by brilliant images of red and the gut-wrenching sounds of a dying friend. Believing her attacker had killed everyone else in the house, she fled the horror, out into the naked night.</p></p><h2>Eat More of What You Love: Over 200 Brand-New Recipes Low in Sugar, Fat, and Calories</h2><p>The hardest foods to give up are the ones you love best - but Marlene Koch says,"you don't have too!"

And then there is Fate. Being destined to become some kind of supernatural electrical outlet isn't exactly awesome--especially when Alexandria's other half is everywhere she goes. Seth's in her training room, outside her classes, and keeps showing up in her bedroom--so not cool. Their connection does have some benefits, like staving off her nightmares of the tragic showdown with her mother, but it has no effect on what Alex feels for the forbidden, pure-blooded Aiden. Or what he will do--and sacrifice--for her. When daimons infiltrate the Covenants and attack students, the gods send furies--lesser gods determined to eradicate any threat to the Covenants and to the gods, and that includes the Apollyon--and Alex. And if that and hordes of aether-sucking monsters didn't blow bad enough, a mysterious threat seems willing to do anything to neutralize Seth, even if that means forcing Alex into servitude--or killing her.

How else are you going to accuse a seven- foot 300 pound man of cheating but kiddingly?'' Intimidating as ever, basketball great Chamberlain (Wilt, 1973, coauthored by David Shaw) reveals a lot more than probably intended in this wordy wit-and-wisdom collection. On the playing floor, Chamberlain was sensational--his arrival in pro basketball totally disrupted the established salary scale, after which he redesigned the game, popularized it, and set a pile of still- standing records. But at the writing table, he is, alas, opinionated, resentful, and unconcerned about continuity, organization, or consistency. (At one point he's a gourmet; later, his favorite food is white bread with peanut butter and mayonnaise.) Chamberlain is also concerned with his stature and sexuality (``few recognize the sensualness I have in this seven- foot frame'') to the point where his isolation, never really dealt with, is painful to consider (though he's not concerned ``to see [his] athletic prowess embodied in offspring''). And he just can't let others be great: Globetrotter Meadowlark Lemon is okay, but team-player centers like Celtic Bill Russell and L.A.'s Abdul Jabbar are limited pretenders. After some obligatory respect, Chamberlain gets to his point: ``There may never have been a star athlete used as a yardstick as much as I....'' (What about Babe Ruth, Pele, Joe Louis, Bobby Jones?) As for today's talent, ``centers now are making $2 million a year...if you pro-rated my salary for what I did...I'd be making $20 million.'' Like Muhammad Ali, Wilt was the greatest, but there's no lilt or wit to make his tale palatable. Ali knows it took Joe Frazier to make him immortal, but Wilt stands forever alone with those awesome records.

The times have changed and Chamberlain, now 50, has too. Always outspoken and sometimes controversial, Chamberlain feels he now has even more freedom to express his views on various subjects. Former and current sports figures, race relations, celebrities, sex, women, and money are topics upon which he has very candid opinions. Sprinkled liberally throughout the book are "Wiltisms," his interesting and often humorous philosophies on life. He devotes a full chapter to sex and love, and tells why he has remained a bachelor after all these years. This is a revealing look at one of the more unique, intelligent, and larger-than-life sports figures of our time. Recommended for public libraries.

For all that we are social creatures, we are too often shoved into solitary confinement by circumstance. The color of our skin isn&#x2019;t like everyone else&#x2019;s, or our language is different, or our religion isn&#x2019;t the one that gets us invited to dinner by the neighbors. That last one has kept me alone for a long, long time. There are no more Druids walking the earth, unless you count the various neo-pagan versions, who are all operating on nineteenth-century reconstructions.<br><br>And despite the fact that I have an apprentice, I suspect she won&#x2019;t be the same sort of Druid that I am&#x2014;I mean believing in the old Irish gods as I do, paying them respect and offering them prayers, observing the holidays and the rites as the Irish used to do in the days before the invasion of the Christians. Gaia doesn&#x2019;t require belief in any deity to be bound to her: She merely requires a highly trained mind and unswerving devotion to her protection. With Granuaile I think there is a willingness to see the divine, to acknowledge and appreciate both its wonder and terror, but a stubborn resistance to worshipping it.<br><br>But she liked staring into campfires well enough. Fires were warm cups of non-thinking serenity after the daily rigors of training. I had been exhausting her mentally with languages and headspace exercises and then physically with the martial arts. By the time the sun sank behind the baked sandstone cliffs of the Navajo Nation each day, she was ready to lose herself in the yellow and orange flickers of flame. And quiz me about my past.<br><br>&#x201c;Ugh,&#x201d; she said, flopping on the ground by our fire pit and popping open a bottle of beer with a hiss and clink as the top fell to the ground. &#x201c;What a day. Wish I could just upload kung fu like Neo instead of learning it the slow way.&#x201d; She leaned back against a rock padded with a bedroll and took a swig, winced at some ache or soreness in her muscles, then said, &#x201c;Tell me about the old days, Atticus, when you were wee and had to walk both ways uphill in feces because no one had toilets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You seriously want to hear about that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d like to hear about some old shit, but it doesn&#x2019;t need to include actual shit, if that helps. I&#x2019;m tired, damn it. Just tell me a story.&#x201d;<br><br> Oberon said through our mental link. He was stretched out by the fire, lying across my feet, belly up for easy rubbing. Granuaile couldn&#x2019;t hear him, but she could follow along because I spoke my part of the conversation aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that, Oberon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, you mean Bast. Yes, I remember. Hard to forget something like that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You already know why she was mad. She wanted me to return the book of her cult&#x2019;s mysteries that I had stolen long ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see. Heh! Yes, I suppose that would be a good story for the night. Wow, this is going way back to the third century. I was still haunting Europe at the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, Atticus, hold on,&#x201d; Granuaile said. &#x201c;Is this going to take a while?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. Is there some hurry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt you in the middle of it. I should answer the call of nature first.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good call, then. We&#x2019;ll reconvene after a few words from nature.&#x201d;<br><br>Some hiding places are better than others. The ones with friendly company are the best, and by friendly I mean people who don&#x2019;t particularly care about your background or what your tattoos mean. They just want a name to call you by, a sense that you&#x2019;ll pull your own weight and contribute to the group&#x2019;s survival, and maybe the occasional joke or roll in the hay. I miss the days of easy anonymity, when I could just make up a name when I got to a village and stay there as long as I could keep from using any magic that would give my position away to the Fae. I met new friends, made myself useful, and disappeared for years at a time.<br><br>That didn&#x2019;t mean I was impossible to find. The Morrigan could find me pretty much anytime she wanted. On this particular occasion, she found me hanging out with the Visigoths in what is now the southern tip of modern-day Moldova, since I was doing my best to avoid the Roman Empire. She lighted in a tree as I was collecting deadwood for the night&#x2019;s fire, and her eyes glowed red to demonstrate that she wasn&#x2019;t the average crow. I looked around. It was just me out there.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Morrigan. Looks like the coast is clear. You need to tell me something?&#x201d;<br><br>She flew down to the ground and shifted to her human form, the red coals in her eyes dying out. &#x201c;Hello, Siodhachan. Yes, I am here to deliver a message. Ogma needs to see you rather urgently. You must go now to meet him in Byzantium.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Byzantium? But that&#x2019;s a mess right now.&#x201d;<br><br>The Visigoths I was staying with were a part of that mess, in fact. Byzantium&#x2014;indeed, most of the Roman Empire&#x2014;was suffering what historians now call the &#x201c;Crisis of the Third Century,&#x201d; dealing with various invasions from its borders while internally their currency was taking a gigantic shit on the tiled mosaics of their bathhouse floors, and they had a string of military leaders taking turns at being emperor. The Morrigan came to see me in 269, right before Aurelian came to power and started to piece the empire back together.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to get worse, especially down in Egypt. I have seen it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seen what, exactly?&#x201d;<br><br>The tiniest of smirks lifted one corner of the Morrigan&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;I have seen you in danger there. So clearly you must go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somehow your words fail to motivate me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to motivate you to go down there. Ogma will do that. I just need you to go see him in Byzantium.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need me to? Why? What&#x2019;s in this for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Favors. The finest currency of them all.&#x201d;<br><br>That was less than subtle. I owed the Morrigan several favors, if not my life, and saying no to her was not an option. &#x201c;Where in Byzantium?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There is a public house called Caesar&#x2019;s Cup. Ogma will be waiting there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to take me a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is aware. But you had best get started.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. Farewell, Morrigan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Until next time, Siodhachan.&#x201d; She shifted back to her crow form and flew off into the dusk. I hauled my wood back to the village, got the evening&#x2019;s communal fire started, then packed my few belongings and slipped into the darkness while everyone was eating their dinner.<br><br>Weeks later I strode into Caesar&#x2019;s Cup, all my tattoos hidden to disguise my Druidry, pretending to be just another Roman citizen out for a drink. Ogma was indeed there, seated at the end of a bench table, his head shaven and his tattoos concealed as well, nursing a goblet of what passed for expensive wine at the time and a board of bread and cheese.<br><br>He bobbed his head at me and gestured that I should sit down across from him.<br><br>&#x201c;No names in here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Speak Latin with me. Have a cup?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; He called for one and poured me a deep red vintage before continuing.<br><br>&#x201c;Well met. Did she tell you why I needed to see you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something involving Aegyptus, but no more than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. The Palmyrans will revolt soon and Rome will answer in force. The great library in Alexandria will be in danger.&#x201d;<br><br>I snorted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always in danger. Julius Caesar nearly burned it down a couple centuries ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We think this time it will be worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma&#x2019;s eyes shifted down the table to a couple of men who had drinks but weren&#x2019;t talking to each other. They were most likely listening to us.<br><br>&#x201c;Myself, my sister, and the crow.&#x201d; He meant Brighid and the Morrigan. &#x201c;Much knowledge will be lost forever. And some of that knowledge should be preserved. I&#x2019;m interested in a few specific scrolls.&#x201d;<br><br>Shrugging, I said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great. Why tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to fetch them for me.&#x201d;<br><br>I stared at him in silence for perhaps three seconds, then looked down at my drink. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. You have all of my skills and more. Surely it must be simple for you to do it yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma chuckled and I looked up. He was grinning widely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s far from simple. It&#x2019;s rather deadly, in fact. These scrolls are well protected.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must be fantastic information.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is. And right now you are probably wondering why you would ever agree to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I admit that had crossed my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will do it because there is truly wondrous information there. Anything you take beyond what I require, you are free to keep.&#x201d;<br><br>I cocked my head to one side. &#x201c;Can you give me an example of what I might be able to take that&#x2019;s worth risking my life?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma checked on the men, and they were still making no attempt to converse. He gestured to the rear of the house. &#x201c;There is a poor excuse for a garden in back. Shall we take in some sun and continue there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>We rose, cups in hand, and strolled past tables and curious eyes. Being covered from the neck down stood out in the summer, especially in a culture where bare legs below the knee were common. Ogma changed his speech to Old Irish and spoke in low tones as we moved.<br><br>&#x201c;Those men are inept but persistent. They have been following me since shortly after I arrived here. We&#x2019;ll see if they abandon all pretense and come after us or not.&#x201d;<br><br>The garden had only a couple of people in it, since it was hot outside and there was limited shade to be had; it was laid out in hedges and flower beds more than trees, and all were starving for water. The scant shelter afforded by the fronds of a lone thirsty palm was already occupied. We strolled to the far side opposite, in full sun but also far away from inquisitive ears. Ogma switched back to Latin and pitched his voice so that only I could hear, even though no one was nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;To answer your question: In the library you will find the mysteries of gods far different from the Tuatha D� Danann or others you may know. Rituals and spells and secrets long kept locked in the darkness, the kind of thing that might help you one day should Aenghus ever catch up to you. Wards that clumsy wizards can attempt only with great care and sacrifice but that you can adapt and re-craft into elegant bindings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound all that great to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it does. And besides, you are bored. You are, what, more than three hundred years old now? Living with the Visigoths for the last five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re charming people and impressive open-air cooks. They know how to roast a rabbit on a spit, let me tell you. And they share amusing stories about their sex accidents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pfahh. You yearn for more than this, Siodhachan. You stole Fragarach from Conn of the Hundred Battles. You absorbed the most powerful herblore of Airmid and keep it close to your heart. You cannot tell me you are satisfied to live life as a drear pastoral, that you are content with all you know and will never seek to know more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That may all be true. But that does not mean I am anxious to seek my death in Alexandria for your benefit, Ogma, begging your pardon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is for your benefit too, as I said. And if you do this for me, Siodhachan, I will owe you a favor. That is currency of far more value than any Roman coin.&#x201d;<br><br>He spoke Truth with a capital T there. When a god says he&#x2019;ll owe you a solid, unspecified, bona fide favor, you need to take time to consider whether you might not be passing up the opportunity of a lifetime. Or indeed something that might preserve your life later on: Some favors, called in at the right time, might equal a Get Out of Death Free card. Though it was clear that Ogma would not be around to get me out of any problems in Alexandria. Whatever he considered to be so deadly there would be doubly so for me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not agreeing yet,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;but you have my attention at least. Tell me more. What am I after, where do I find it, and what&#x2019;s in my way?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma smiled as victors do, drank deeply, and refilled both our cups before answering.<br><br>&#x201c;There is a sealed room of treasures beneath the library, similar to the burial chambers of pharaohs in their pyramids. Inside there are some scrolls and even a few bound books. There may be some scepters and the like, remarkable for their power more than their beauty. I want a bundle of four scrolls sealed in a lacquered box marked with the eye of Horus. You are familiar with that symbol?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. But it&#x2019;s fairly common, isn&#x2019;t it? There might be many such boxes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If the room is sealed, how do you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Tuatha D� Danann have their own all-seeing eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. The Morrigan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so special about these scrolls?&#x201d;<br><br>The god of languages shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be sure until I read them.&#x201d; A transparent evasion that meant he&#x2019;d rather not tell me.<br><br>&#x201c;Who built the room and sealed it, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoever built it is no doubt dead. But at least part of it is supposed to be the private hoard of the Egyptian goddess Seshat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not familiar with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Goddess of writing and preserving knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. Preserving knowledge. I imagine in this case she&#x2019;s preserving it from would-be thieves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. You may reasonably expect some curses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Such as?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;<br><br>I threw up my hands. &#x201c;This chamber is underground and sealed in dead, quarried stone, right? I&#x2019;ll be cut off from Gaia and essentially powerless. I don&#x2019;t see how it can be done.&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma nodded at me, offering a small smirk. He&#x2019;d anticipated the objection. &#x201c;I have something that will help with that, at least.&#x201d;</p><h2>A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America</h2><p><b><b>Now the&nbsp;Netflix Limited Series&nbsp;<i>Unbelievable,</i>&nbsp;starring Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn&nbsp;Dever&nbsp;</b>� Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists tell the riveting true crime story of a teenager charged with lying about having been raped&#x2014;and the detectives who followed a winding path to arrive at the truth.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;Gripping . . .

Within days police and even those closest to Marie became suspicious of her story. The police swiftly pivoted and began investigating Marie. Confronted with inconsistencies in her story and the doubts of others, Marie broke down and said her story was a lie&#x2014;a bid for attention. Police charged Marie with false reporting, and she was branded a liar.&nbsp;<br><br>More than two years later, Colorado detective Stacy Galbraith was assigned to investigate a case of sexual assault. Describing the crime to her husband that night, Galbraith learned that the case bore an eerie resemblance to a rape that had taken place months earlier in a nearby town. She joined forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, and the two soon discovered they were dealing with a serial rapist: a man who photographed his victims, threatening to release the images online, and whose calculated steps to erase all physical evidence suggested he might be a soldier or a cop. Through meticulous police work the detectives would eventually connect the rapist to other attacks in Colorado&#x2014;and beyond.<br><br>Based on investigative files and extensive interviews with the principals,&nbsp;<i>A False Report</i>&nbsp;is a serpentine tale of doubt, lies, and a hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing truth of how sexual assault is investigated today&#x2014;and the long history of skepticism toward rape victims.&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>T.

She was no longer crying. At the bottom, the police handed her off to the two people who were waiting for her there. Marie belonged to a support program for teenagers aging out of foster care. These two were program managers.</p><p>So, one said.</p><p>Were you raped?</p><p>It had been one week since Marie, an eighteen-year-old with hazel eyes, wavy hair, and braces, had reported being raped by a stranger with a knife who had broken into her apartment and blindfolded, bound, and gagged her. In that week Marie had told the story to police at least five times. She had told them: thin white man, short as five feet six. Blue jeans. Hoodie--gray, maybe white. Eyes--possibly blue. But her story wasn&#x2019;t always the same in the telling. And the police had heard from people in Marie&#x2019;s life who had doubts. And when the police had confronted Marie about those doubts, she had wavered, then buckled, saying she had made the story up--because her foster mom wasn&#x2019;t answering her calls, because her boyfriend was now just a friend, because she wasn&#x2019;t used to being alone.</p><p>Because she had wanted attention.</p><p>She&#x2019;d sketched her history for the police detectives. She&#x2019;d described growing up with something like twenty different foster parents. She&#x2019;d told them she had been raped when she was seven years old. She&#x2019;d told them that being on her own for the first time had made her scared. Her story of being raped by an intruder had &#x201c;turned into a big thing that was never meant to happen,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told the police.</p><p>Today she had tested whatever patience the police could still summon. She had returned to the station and doubled back, saying she had told the truth the first time, saying she really had been raped. But when pressed in that interview room she had folded once more--admitting, again, that her story was a lie.&nbsp;</p><p>No, Marie told the managers at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>No. I was not raped.</p><p>The two managers, Jana and Wayne, worked for Project Ladder, a nonprofit program that helped foster kids make the transition to living on their own. Project Ladder taught teenagers--eighteen-year-olds, mostly--the mundane skills of adulthood, from how to shop for groceries to how to manage a credit card. The biggest boost the program provided was financial. Project Ladder subsidized each teen&#x2019;s one-bedroom apartment, making it possible for the kids to get a foothold in the expensive rental market ringing Seattle. Wayne was Marie&#x2019;s case manager. Jana was a program supervisor.</p><p>If that&#x2019;s the case, the managers told Marie, if you weren&#x2019;t raped, then there&#x2019;s something you have to do.</p><p>Marie dreaded whatever was next. She had seen it on their faces when she&#x2019;d answered the question. They weren&#x2019;t thrown. They weren&#x2019;t taken aback. They&#x2019;d doubted her before, just like the others. It occurred to Marie that from now on, people would think she was mentally ill. She, too, wondered if she was broken, if there was something in her that needed to be fixed. Marie realized just how vulnerable she had become. She worried about losing what little she had left. A week ago, she&#x2019;d had friends, her first job, her first place to call her own, freedom to come and go, a sense of life unfurling. But now that job and that sense of optimism were gone. The place and her freedom were in jeopardy. And friends she could turn to? She was down to one.</p><p>Her story had, indeed, turned into a big thing. Last week the television news had been all over it. &#x201c;A western Washington woman has confessed that she cried wolf,&#x201d; one newscast said. In Seattle the local affiliates for ABC, NBC, and CBS had covered the story. The NBC affiliate, KING 5, zoomed in on Marie&#x2019;s apartment complex--panning up the stairs, lingering on an open window--while Jean Enersen, Seattle&#x2019;s most popular anchor, told viewers: &#x201c;Police in Lynnwood now say a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted by a stranger made up the story. . . . Detectives do not know why she made the story up. She could face a charge of false reporting.&#x201d;</p><p>Television reporters had pounded on her door, tried to get her to answer questions on camera about why she had lied. To get away she&#x2019;d snuck out, a sweatshirt over her face.</p><p>Her story found its way into remote corners of the Internet. False Rape Society, a blog that focuses on wrongful accusations, posted twice about the Lynnwood case: &#x201c;Another in a seemingly endless cavalcade of false rape claims. Once again, the accuser is young--a teenager. . . . To underscore how serious this particular kind of lie is, sentencing for false rape claims needs to be tougher. Much tougher. Only then will the liars be deterred.&#x201d; A Londoner who compiles an &#x201c;international timeline of false rape allegations&#x201d; going back to 1674 made the Lynnwood case his 1,188th entry, following a Georgia teenager who &#x201c;had consensual sex with another student then pointed the finger at an imaginary man who was driving a green Chevrolet,&#x201d; and a teen in England who &#x201c;appears to have withdrawn her consent after texting him to tell him how much she enjoyed it!&#x201d; &#x201c;As will be seen from this database,&#x201d; the compiler writes, &#x201c;some women will cry rape at the drop of a hat, or more often after dropping their knickers then regretting it.&#x201d;</p><p>In Washington and beyond, Marie&#x2019;s story became an exhibit in a centuries-long argument about credibility and rape.</p><p>The news stories hadn&#x2019;t named her. But the people around Marie knew. A friend from tenth grade called and said: How could you lie about something like that? It was the same question the TV reporters wanted to ask. It was the same question Marie got wherever she turned. She didn&#x2019;t answer her friend. She just listened, then hung up--another friendship, gone. Marie had let another friend borrow her laptop computer--one of those old black IBMs--and now the friend refused to give it back. When Marie confronted her, she told Marie: If you can lie, I can steal. This same friend--or former friend--would call Marie and threaten her, telling her she should die. People held Marie up as the reason no one believed real victims of rape. People called her a bitch and a whore.</p><p>The Project Ladder managers told Marie what she had to do. And they told her that if she didn&#x2019;t do it, she would be cast out of the program. She would lose her subsidized apartment. She would be without a home.</p><p>The managers took Marie back to her apartment complex and summoned the other teens in Project Ladder--Marie&#x2019;s peers, kids her age with the same kinds of stories to tell about growing up as wards of the state. There were around ten of them. Most were girls. In the front office, near the pool, they gathered in a circle and sat down. Marie stood. She stood and told them--told everyone, including the upstairs neighbor who one week before had made the 911 call to report the rape--that it was all a lie, that they didn&#x2019;t need to worry: There was no rapist out there to be on guard against, no rapist the police needed to be looking for.</p><p>She cried as she confessed--the sound magnified by the awkward silence surrounding her. If there was sympathy in the room, Marie sensed it from just one person, a girl sitting to her right. In everyone else&#x2019;s eyes she saw a question--Why would you do that?--and a corresponding judgment: That&#x2019;s messed up.</p><p>In the weeks and months to come, there would be more fallout from Marie&#x2019;s retraction. But for Marie there would be no moment worse than this.</p><p>She had one friend left to turn to, and after the meeting, Marie made for Ashley&#x2019;s home. Marie didn&#x2019;t have a driver&#x2019;s license--just a learner&#x2019;s permit--so she walked. On the way there, she came to a bridge. The bridge crossed Interstate 5, the state&#x2019;s busiest road, a north&#x2013;south highway with a ceaseless current of Subarus and eighteen-wheelers.</p><p>Marie thought about how much she wanted to jump.</p><p>She took out her phone, called Ashley, and said: Please come get me before I do something stupid.</p><p>Then she threw her phone over the side.</p></p><h2>The History of the Church, Semester Edition</h2><p>This book presents the story of God&#39;s intervention into human history from the earthly life of Christ to the present day.

Picking up where he left off in Finishing the Hat, he gives us all the lyrics, along with cutouts and early drafts, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sunday in the Park with George, as well as Into the Woods, Assassins, and Passion. Here too is an in-depth look at Wise Guys, subsequently transformed into Bounce, and eventually into Road Show. And we are treated to chapters on his work for television and film and his &#34;orphan songs,&#34; culled from parodies and special occasions over the years. Filled with behind-the-scenes photographs and illustrations from original manuscripts, and with the same elegant design as the earlier book, Look, I Made A Hat will be devoured by Sondheim&#39;s passionate fans today and for years to come.</p><p>Stephen Sondheim has written award-winning music and lyrics for theatre, film, and television. He is also the coauthor of the film The Last of Sheila and the play Getting Away with Murder. Sondheim is on the council of the Dramatists Guild of America, having served as its president from 1973 to 1981. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;Sondheim is a national treasure, a giant in the world of musical theater who changed the structure and sound of the form in 20th-century masterpieces. Speaking of heaven, though, here's <i>Look, I Made a Hat</i>, the second part of Sondheim's two-volume collection of lyrics, this one spanning 1981-2011, with additional bits and pieces. Talmudically thorough and devilishly diverting with what the author refers to as &#x2018;attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, digressions, anecdotes, and miscellany,&#x2019; the book is divine. It's also even more magnanimously authoritative than the first book. The handsomely designed book, like the first volume, contains illuminating reproductions of pages from the author's beloved legal pads on which he works out rhyme schemes, as well as annotated scripts and pages of musical notations. And the second volume is brimming &#x2014; a word Sondheim would probably dismiss as &#x2018;infelicitous&#x2019; &#x2014; with precise, vigorous, instructive, sharp-tongued, and often very funny comments. <i>Look, I Made a Hat</i>, together with <i>Finishing the Hat</i>, makes an enormously satisfying journal by one of the great theatrical minds of our time, a guide and touchstone for who knows how many future great theatrical minds. A&#x201d; &#x2014;Lisa Schwarzbaum, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;While the book technically covers Mr. Sondheim&#x2019;s output from 1981 to the present, aficionados will delight in all the bits and bobs from early in his career that Mr. Sondheim didn&#x2019;t make room for in the first volume . . . The extensive miscellany also includes a drawerful of lyrics Mr. Sondheim wrote as birthday gifts for friends like Harold Prince, Mary Rodgers and Leonard Bernstein. One of the choicest pleasures of the first volume was in Mr. Sondheim&#x2019;s sharp-minded analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of musical theater lyricists from the past. He&#x2019;s covered most of that territory already, so the new book features essays on &#x2018;Awards and Their Uselessness&#x2019; and &#x2018;Critics and Their Uses&#x2019; &#x2014; savory reading.&#x201d; &#x2014;Charles Isherwood, <i>New York Times</i></p><h2>The Letter to the Ephesians (The Pillar New Testament Commentary (PNTC))</h2><p>From a foremost authority on the New Testament comes a major new commentary on Ephesians--a letter of truth, love, and unity to our superficial world.<br><br>This volume in the Pillar New Testament Commentary series provides a rich exposition of Ephesians, one of the most significant documents ever written. Using the fruits of recent biblical research, Peter O'Brien shows how Ephesians sums up God's magnificent plan of salvation in Christ and spells out his divine purpose for believers today.<br><br>A model of the scholarly excellence characteristic of the entire PNTC series (which now features a striking new jacket design), O'Brien's Ephesians will become the standard work on this profoundly influential book.</p><p>Peter O&#39;Brien is senior research fellow in New Testament, Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia.<b>Theological Book Review</b><br> "O'Brien has produced a well-researched and clearly presented commentary on Ephesians.

Best-selling author Gladwell (The Tipping Point) has a dazzling ability to find commonality in disparate fields of study. As he displays again in this entertaining and illuminating look at how we make snap judgments-about people&#39;s intentions, the authenticity of a work of art, even military strategy-he can parse for general readers the intricacies of fascinating but little-known fields like professional food tasting (why does Coke taste different from Pepsi?). Gladwell&#39;s conclusion, after studying how people make instant decisions in a wide range of fields from psychology to police work, is that we can make better instant judgments by training our mind and senses to focus on the most relevant facts-and that less input (as long as it&#39;s the right input) is better than more. Perhaps the most stunning example he gives of this counterintuitive truth is the most expensive war game ever conducted by the Pentagon, in which a wily marine officer, playing &#34;a rogue military commander&#34; in the Persian Gulf and unencumbered by hierarchy, bureaucracy and too much technology, humiliated American forces whose chiefs were bogged down in matrixes, systems for decision making and information overload. But if one sets aside Gladwell&#39;s dazzle, some questions and apparent inconsistencies emerge. If doctors are given an algorithm, or formula, in which only four facts are needed to determine if a patient is having a heart attack, is that really educating the doctor&#39;s decision-making ability-or is it taking the decision out of the doctor&#39;s hands altogether and handing it over to the algorithm? Still, each case study is satisfying, and Gladwell imparts his own evident pleasure in delving into a wide range of fields and seeking an underlying truth.</p><p><i>Blink</i> is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of <i>The Tipping Point</i>, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of "thin slices" of behavior. The key is to rely on our "adaptive unconscious"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <p> Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us "mind blind," focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to "the Warren Harding Effect" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the "dark side of blink," he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell's ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Malcolm Gladwell has been a staff writer with the New Yorker since 1996.

By the author of All Night Long. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Jayne Ann Krentz is the author of fifty New York Times bestsellers. She has written contemporary romantic suspense novels under that name, as well as futuristic and historical romance novels under the pseudonyms Jayne Castle and Amanda Quick, respectively. She lives in Seattle.This spirited paranormal romance is the latest in Krentz's Arcane Society series (which includes some novels, like the recent <i>Second Sight</i>, written as Amanda Quick). Clare Lancaster, like her parents and grandparents, is a member of the clandestine Arcane Society, an association of parasensitives who are dedicated to the study of the paranormal. Clare's extraordinary abilities as a human lie detector make even other paranormals uneasy, with the exception of her half-sister Elizabeth. Elizabeth's troubled marriage brings Clare to Arizona and into the family circle. There, Clare finally meets Archer Glazebrook, her biological father, but she also meets Jake Salter, another highly talented parasensitive who turns out to be on assignment from Jones &amp; Jones (the investigative arm of the Arcane Society) to track down a possible plot to take over the society. The cabal he's after has some connection to the still-unsolved murder of Clare's objectionable brother-in-law months before. More murders follow, and Jake and Clare have to work together to save themselves and the society. Krentz delivers another evocative romance, complete with engaging dialogue and explicit sex scenes, but the real meat of the plot concerns the sleuthing: that a charismatic alpha male finally meets his mate is icing on another densely plotted Krentz confection. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first, a well-known Japanese term, sanpaku, describes a condition in which the white of the eye can be seen between the pupil and the lower lid as the subject gazes directly forward. This, we quickly learn, connotes a grave state of physical and spiritual imbalance. The sanpaku is out of touch with himself, his body and the natural forces of the universe. Symptomatically, sanpaku can be recognized by chronic fatigue, low sexual vitality, poor instinctive reactions, bad humor, inability to sleep soundly and lack of precision in thought and action. Macrobiotics, our second term (and one which quickly became part of the English language) is the simple, natural means of correcting the dangerous sanpaku condition and creating a state of health, harmony and well-being, within and without. <p>Based philosophically on the ancient Oriental concept of Yin-Yang forces in the universe, and biochemically on the important relationship between sodium and potassium in the body, macrobiotics has been known and practiced in the Far East for many centuries. </p><p>The macrobiotic diet, the author claims, not only cures existing ills but fortifies the body against disease. And macrobiotics has been welcomed by weight-watchers as a means to rapid weight loss.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Story of Mankind (A Liveright Book)</h2><p>Van Loon&#39;s approach to history is a delight--a treasure for children and adults alike. It is a newberry Medal Award winner and has been translated into almost all of the better known languages of Europe.</p><p>Anyone who can chronicle world history from 500,000 B.C. to present times--and do so in a lively, entertaining style--deserves a medal. Luckily, the bestowers of the very first Newbery Medal in 1922 thought so, too. The warm, personable tone of Hendrik Willem van Loon's writing lends itself to true learning in a way that stern, dry textbooks never do. In the introduction, he describes climbing a tower in Rotterdam in his youth. Years later, the perspective at the top inspired the author to develop a metaphor of history as a "mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages."<p> This genuinely enjoyable charmer, for history buffs and the historically challenged alike, covers human history from prehistoric times, when our earliest ancestors were learning to communicate with grunts, right through to the issues of the latter 20th century: gay rights, Arab-Israeli conflicts, and health and fitness. Revised and updated several times since 1921, van Loon's inviting classic is filled with stories (and witty parenthetical asides) that bring history alive. His pen-and-ink illustrations, maps, and animated chronology contribute to the cozy, round the fireplace aspect of the book. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>It was intended for children, and of course much of the science is hopelessly out of date, but this ambitious, even audacious attempt to offer an overview of the entirety of human history remains a breathtaking work today. A 1921 bestseller, The Story of Mankind won the first Newbery Medal in 1922, and it is no wonder: the book--which begins with the origin of life itself on our planet and the arrival of the earliest protohumans on the scene and ends with &#34;The Last Fifty Years, Including Several Explanations and an Apology&#34;--is abundant with an offbeat charm and packed with the author&#39;s own beautiful illustrations and maps that are alive with a fresh, delectable humor. As a document of early modern science writing, it is invaluable. As a delightfully entertaining read, it is not to be missed.</p><h2>The Time of My Life</h2><p>An entertaining and inspiring behind-the-scenes look at a Hollywood life and a remarkable love, told in the words of beloved actor Patrick Swayze and his wife, Lisa Niemi, shortly before he passed away.

I had just wrapped shooting on the pilot of a new TV series, <i>The Beast.</i> My wife, Lisa, and I were enjoying a second honeymoon of sorts after a long, difficult period in which we had grown painfully apart. And I was feeling excited about new work, new directions, and the promise of the future.</p><p>Lisa and I were planning to spend New Year's Eve at our ranch in New Mexico, as we'd done for the past few years. But first, we stopped off in Aspen to visit a couple of friends. It was there that I got the first hint that something was wrong.</p><p>I had been having some digestive trouble, mostly acid reflux and a kind of bloated feeling, for a few weeks. I've had a sensitive stomach my whole life, so I hadn't thought much of it, but lately I just couldn't shake the constant discomfort. I wasn't hungry and felt sick whenever I did eat, but I'd always been pretty healthy, so I figured the feeling would pass eventually.</p><p>In Aspen, we all raised glasses of champagne for a toast. I took a sip, and as the champagne began to course through my esophagus to my stomach, I nearly choked -- it burned like acid going down. It felt like I'd drunk lye, a sharp, searing pain that brought tears to my eyes. I'd never felt anything like it, but not wanting to ruin the festivities, I said nothing to Lisa. I was used to ignoring pain, so I just didn't drink any more champagne that night, and didn't think anything more about it.</p><p>Three weeks later, in January 2008, I learned that the burning in my stomach wasn't some minor irritation. It was the result of blockage in my bile ducts, which was caused by pancreatic cancer -- just about the most deadly, untreatable cancer you can get.</p><p>When my doctor at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles said the words "pancreatic cancer," a single thought popped into my mind: I'm a dead man. That's what I had always thought when I heard someone had pancreatic cancer, and it usually turned out to be true. My doctor told me that my chances of surviving for more than a few months weren't high, and I had no reason to doubt him.<br></p><p>A lot of things go through your head when you get a death sentence handed to you, starting with <i>Why me? What did I do to deserve this? </i>Once the shock wears off, it's hard not to sink into bitterness, to feel that you've been singled out in a way that's not fair. For me, that initial shock quickly turned to selfcriticism and blame. <i>Did I do this to myself? What could I have done differently? Is it my fault?</i></p><p>In those first few weeks after my diagnosis, amid the whirlwind of figuring out treatments and medication, I struggled, with Lisa's help, to make sense of what was happening to me. Trying to counteract all the negative emotions that kept welling up -- anger, bitterness, despair -- I began thinking to myself, <i>I've had more lifetimes than any ten people put together, and it's been an amazing ride. So this is okay.</i></p><p>I was trying to find a way to accept what was going on, but then a funny thing happened. I just couldn't. I wasn't ready to go, and I was damned if this disease was going to take me before I was good and ready. So I said to my doctor, "Show me where the enemy is, and I will fight him." I wanted to understand exactly what I was up against so I could go after this cancer rather than waiting for it to beat me. And in the year and a half since my diagnosis, that's exactly what I've done, with every ounce of energy I have.</p><p>Fighting cancer has been the most challenging and eyeopening experience I've ever had, and it has sent me on an emotional journey deeper than anything I've felt before. Facing your own mortality is the quickest way possible to find out what you're made of. It strips away all the bullshit and exposes every part of you -- your strengths and weaknesses, your sense of self. Your soul.</p><p>It also leads you to confront life's hardest questions: Is there a heaven? Will I make it in? Has this life counted for something other than just my own narcissism? Have I lived a good life? Am I a good person? It's easy to dismiss these difficult questions when you have your whole life ahead of you. But when you're faced with your own mortality, they suddenly take on a whole new meaning.</p><p>There's a scene at the end of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> that really resonated with me when I first saw it, and it does now more than ever. As an old man, Private Ryan muses aloud about whether he's lived a good life. "I tried to live my life the best I could," he says. "I hope that was enough." It's so hard to judge your own life, to know whether you've made a mark in this world. Doing this book was, in part, a quest to find that out for myself.</p><p>I've never been one to spend a lot of time dwelling in the past, so spending time with Lisa looking back at our lives has been really illuminating. Especially in light of what our future now holds, it has also been cathartic. I never felt like I had all the answers, and I certainly don't claim to now. Yet the one thing I realized as Lisa and I retraced the arc of our lives is that no matter what happened, we never, ever gave up -- on each other, or on our dreams. I'm far from perfect, and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But that's one thing we both got right, and it's the one thing that's keeping me going today.</p><p>As I write this, sitting in our beautiful ranch home in New Mexico with the sun beaming down on the mountains, I realize yet again how much more I want to do in this life. Together with Lisa, I'll keep on pushing, keep on believing. Because that, in the end, is the greatest gift we have.</p><p><i>Patrick Swayze<br>June 2009</i><br></p><p>As Patrick and I have been writing this book, I couldn't help but be amazed by all the stories of things we've done and been through. It was surprising to me how hard we've both worked our whole lives, how focused and single-minded we could be. It must be the dancer in us. Always striving to be more, do better, never settle. And that drive to be better has served us well, particularly with all that we're going through now.</p><p>Looking back now, I wish I had done more of the proverbial "stop and smell the roses." So many gorgeous, beautiful things have happened in my life and I was too busy moving forward to really, truly recognize and enjoy them. I'm feeling different these days. Today I find myself much more willing to take luxurious, selfish pleasure in how beautiful a day is, the wonderful smell of my favorite mare's hair, and how much overflowing love I feel for my husband.</p><p>After Patrick was first diagnosed, I found myself wanting to go back in time and fix all the bumps that we had ever encountered. I wished we could start all over again so that this time we could do it differently. We could be wiser, avoid all those wrong turns we made, and not waste so much time. This time we would laugh more, touch each other more, and simply love each other in the way our true selves always have. And of course, if this daydream came true, I'd get a chance to live our lives together all over again, fulfilling my greatest wish -- to have more time with him.</p><p>In some ways, getting to do this book gave me a passport into the past. But not in the way I had thought. It couldn't elongate my time with him, but it did show me that some of those bumps I wished I could get rid of don't look so bad when we keep coming out on the other side. And they're a testament to the strength of what we are together.</p><p>You'd think that when someone close to you receives a death sentence it would inspire amazing insights and lessons about life. I know that's what I thought. But after his diagnosis, and after I started to recover from feeling I was trapped in a perpetual nightmare, I looked around and couldn't see a damn lesson in sight. Yet slowly, as I've been dealing with getting past the initial grief and fear, living each day that comes and running around preparing for all the things one can't possibly prepare for, the lessons have started to ease out into the open. I couldn't force them out any sooner. They come in their own time when they, and you, are good and ready.</p><p>There's a lot of wisdom in the idea of living one day at a time. And when you might not have someone for long, that's what starts to happen.</p><p>I used to be afraid of time -- that I'd run out of it, that I wouldn't have time to do all the things I wanted. Now I'm seeing each minute that passes as a victory. As something I'm proud of. It's like I can gather all these minutes into my arms as if they're an enormous mass of jewels. Look what I have -- another moment! A kiss, a stroke of the skin on my husband's arm, the light coming through the window just so...Each of these jewels gives me the confidence to stand up and look Death in the face and say, "No one's going anywhere today."</p><p>I can help Patrick -- I can coach him, love him, track his medications and calories, be there to kick him in the pants or just hold his hand if he needs it. But I can't save him. And I try to remember that. But I've got the best possible thing on my side: Patrick himself. I love that he's such a fighter. He's so amazingly strong and beautiful. He's my best weapon against this terrible disease.</p><p>You know, we were in New Mexico a couple of years after Patrick had broken both his legs in a life-threatening horse accident while filming <i>Letters from a Killer.</i> We walked out into the fresh mountain air, and he had taken off his shirt to enjoy the sun as we strolled into our beautiful fifty-acre pasture to visit with our five spirited Arabian horses. Patrick was rubbing one of the horses on her neck and I had walked off a ways for some reason or another. And I turned around just in time to see him grab a handful of mane and swing himself up on the mare's back. No saddle, no bridle, nothing.</p><p>She and the other horses started to trot off together and then, in a tight group, they launched into a full gallop, Patrick riding bareback in the middle of them through the open field. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't help but see how fantastic and free he looked. And I couldn't help but be piss...</p></p><h2>More Adventures of the Great Brain</h2><p>In 1896 the Great Brain of Adenville, Utah, is almost twelve years old and more mischievous than ever in his practical jokes and schemes against everyone in town.</p><p>"Amusing and touching, poking gentle fun at human foibles, this lively story of another day should please readers on any age level."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.John D.

It also looks at his unique personal qualities as a leader and how these qualities marked him as a leader among leaders. In doing so, it reveals a man whose greatness did not stem from oratorical skills, superior knowledge, or brilliant military tactics, but from virtue. He understood his duty and his proper role in the fledgling nation, and he pursued it with an invincible resolution. Largely, this was due to his belief that God in his providence had chosen him to lead the new nation that was founded on liberty?civil, religious, and economic?and that the experiment that began under his leadership as president of the Constitutional Convention and was successful under his leadership in battle would prosper under his leadership and change the world if given the opportunity to succeed.</p><p><b>Stephen McDowell</b> is the co-founder and president of the Providence Foundation, a nonprofit Christian education organization.

Also available in audio for the first time, read by Academy Award nominee James Franco.The two things that conjured up that horrible night, were his run of luck at the Wheel of Fortune, and the mask ...Meet Johnny Smith. A young man whose streak of luck ends dramatically in a major car crash. Followed by blackness. A long, long time in cold limbo.When he wakes up life has been turned upside down. His fiancee has met someone else. And Johnny is cursed with the power to perceive evil in men&#39;s souls. He&#39;s had these hunches since he had an ice-skating accident as a child. Now he has an ability to see into the future. An ability which will bring him into a terrifying confrontation with a charismatic, power-hungry and dangerous man ...</p><p>In the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers</i>, Gary Westfahl predicts that "King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era." <p> If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the "dead zone" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history.</p><p> <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was "the best," Stephen King answered, "The one that I think works the best is <i>Dead Zone</i>. It's the one that [has] the most story." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King has been described by the Guardian as &#39;one of the greatest storytellers of our time&#39;, by the Mirror as a &#39;genius&#39; and by The Sunday Times as &#39;one of the most fertile storytellers of the modern novel.&#39; In 2003, he was given the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

The Georgetown set included Phil and Kay Graham, husband-and-wife publishers of <i>The Washington Post</i>; Joe and Stewart Alsop, odd-couple brothers who were among the country&#x2019;s premier political pundits; Frank Wisner, a driven, manic-depressive lawyer in charge of CIA covert operations; and a host of other diplomats, spies, and scholars responsible for crafting America&#x2019;s response to the Soviet Union from Truman to Reagan.<br><br>This was a smaller, cozier Washington&#x2014;utterly unlike today&#x2019;s capital&#x2014;where presidents made foreign policy in consultation with reporters and professors over martinis and hors d&#x2019;oeuvres, and columnists like the Alsops promoted those policies in the next day&#x2019;s newspapers. &nbsp;Together, they navigated the perilous years of the Cold War, yielding triumphs&#x2014;and tragedies&#x2014;with very real consequences for present-day America and the world. <br><br>Gregg Herken captures their successes and failures and gives us intimate portraits of these dedicated and talented, if deeply flawed, individuals.

Joe returned in September 1945 to the small brick town house on Georgetowns Dumbarton Avenue where he had lived before the war. A U.S. Navy lieutenant, Alsop had been in Hong Kong when Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese. Sent to an internment camp, he was repatriated to the States in a June 1942 prisoner exchange. But Alsop had quickly gone back to China, becoming an aide and adviser to General Claire Chennault, commander of the American Volunteer Groupthe famed Flying Tigers. There, Joe had deliberately inserted himself into the labyrinthine complexities of Sino-American affairs. He was literate, excitable and persuasive with just enough superficial acquaintance with the situation to be opinionated and to appear knowledgeable, the historian Barbara Tuchman, a noted China expert and Alsop critic, later wrote.<br><br>Joe had sided with Chennault in the latters protracted feud with the U.S. Army general Joseph Vinegar Joe Stilwell over Americas strategy in China. Chennault trusted in air power and in Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek, a U.S. ally, to defeat the Japanese. Stilwell believed Chiangwhom he derisively called the Peanutto be hopelessly corrupt, and planned to beat the enemy in a traditional ground offensive, using Chinese troops bolstered by American lend-lease aid. Alsops lobbying on behalf of Chennault ultimately played a role in President Franklin D. Roosevelts 1944 decision to recall Stilwell. Alsop returned from the war in Asia with a strong anti-Communist bias, an enduring belief that it was Americas duty to stand up for the underdog, and an impressive collection of Ming dynasty ceramics.<br><br>On his way home from China, Alsop had stopped off in Paris to visit his longtime friend and Harvard classmate Bill Patten. Bills wife, Susan Mary, recalled that Joes luggage contained lots of emeralds...and rare old Chinese bronzes for the Alsop collection.<br><br>The emeralds were for the wife of Joes younger brother Stewart, who had been kept out of the U.S. Army after Pearl Harbor by asthma and high blood pressure. Stew had instead joined Britains Kings Royal Rifle Corps, transferring in 1944 to Americas Office of Strategic Services, where he became a member of the legendary OSS Jedburghs, three-man commando teams who had parachuted into Nazi-occupied France to aid the Resistance. At wars end, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French government for his work with the partisans. Stewart was preparing for similar Jedburgh missions in Thailand when Japan surrendered.<br><br>Uninterested in the prospect of returning to his prewar desk job as an editor at Doubleday after his derring-do with the OSS, Stew had filled out an application for the Foreign Service before deciding to throw in his lot with Joe, as co-author of a syndicated political column for the New York Herald Tribune. The man who would be described as the kinder, gentler Alsop, and a more human version of his older brother, added a needed perspective and more moderate temperament to the column they dubbed Matter of Fact. Their four-times-a-week column, Stewart boasted, would be essential reading for those who want, not only the news-behind-the news but the news-before-the news. Both Alsops would also write longer pieces for The Saturday Evening Post, with which Joe had a long-standing relationship.<br><br>Stewart and his British-born wife, Patricia HankeyTishtemporarily moved in with relatives but later bought a house on Dumbarton, just down the block from Joe. The first installment of the brothers newspaper column would appear on the last day of 195.<br><br>like stewart alsop, the attorney Frank Gardiner Wisner, thirty-six, had spent the war overseas in the OSS and had just as little interest in returning to his prewar job. Enlisting in the navy six months before Pearl Harbor, Wisner had transferred into the countrys fledgling intelligence service shortly after fighting began. Stationed first in Egypt, then in Turkey, he later became the OSS station chief in Bucharest, Romania. In 1944, Wisners official task had been to help rescue downed American fliers. But his first priority was keeping tabs on the Soviets in the Romanian capital, as the Red Army pushed the German Wehrmacht out of Eastern Europe.<br><br>Wisners apprehensions about Soviet intentions had grown in step with the Russian advance. The final shock had come in early winter 1945, when Frank watched helplessly as the Russians filled more than two dozen unheated boxcars with thousands of ethnic Germansmen, women, and childrenand shipped the families to an uncertain fate as slave laborers in the east. (Like a modern-day Paul Revere, Wisner had driven frantically around the Romanian capital in his jeep, trying to warn the Volksdeutschebut he was too late.) Until then, Wisner wrote in his final OSS report from Bucharest, the Soviets had been fairly careful to avoid giving the appearance of taking over the country. Frank finished out the war in U.S.-occupied Germany, keeping an eye on the Russians just across the border. With characteristic impatience, Wisner secretly sent three OSS operatives through Soviet lines to recruit new agents for a postwar spy network; the ink had barely dried on the German surrender document when Frank had his first report on life in Russian-occupied Berlin.<br><br>Temporarily at a loss as to what to do in a world at peace, Wisner reluctantly went back to his prewar job at the Wall Street law firm of Carter Ledyard in early 1946. But he had recently told his wife, Polly, that he was bored with being an attorney and tired of living in New York City. Wisner had discovered that his time as a wartime spy chiefquartered in the requisitioned thirty-room mansion of a Bucharest beer magnate, with a fleet of captured Mercedes in the courtyard and a young Romanian princess serving as his self-described hostessstill held a siren-like appeal. Anticipating a move to Washington in the near future, Frank purchased a three-hundred-acre farm in rural Maryland.<br><br>thirty-year-old Philip Graham returned to a Washington very much changed by the war. The parochial town said to have a reputation for northern charm and southern efficiency had suddenly become the capital of the Free World. A magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law, class of 1939, Graham had clerked for the Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter following law school. But the brilliant political career that most assumed lay ahead of Phil was first postponed, and then forgotten, after he married his future bosss daughter, Katharine Meyer, in 1940.<br><br>As only his wife and close friends at the time knew, Grahams confident and charming demeanor masked a carefully hidden secret. Beginning with his undergraduate years at the University of Florida, Phil had shown signs of the sudden and radical mood swings that would characterize his later life: periods of almost-maniacal and incandescent energy alternated with bouts of deep, incapacitating depression.<br><br>Shortly before Pearl Harbor, Phil had joined the Office of Emergency Management, which was readying the country for the coming conflict. In 1942, he enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a private, ending the war as a major on the AAF intelligence staff in the Philippines. He had originally signed up with the more prestigious OSS but after two weeks decided that he had had enough of what he called the white-shoe boys and requested reassignment to a bombardment squadron, or similar duties.<br><br>By April 1945, Katharine GrahamKayhad given birth to the couples second child and moved the family into a new home at Georgetowns Thirty-Third and O Streets. A dozen years earlier, Kays father, Eugene Meyer, had bought a struggling newspaper, The Washington Post, at a bankruptcy sale. Meyer had extracted a promise from Phil that the son-in-law would take over the paper when he returned from the war.<br><br>Having previously worked as a reporter on a San Francisco newspaper, Kay gave up her job on the Washington Post circulation desk to devote her full time to the children and Phil, who became the new associate publisher of the paper on January 1, 1946. Along with the Herald Tribune, the Post was one of the major urban dailies subscribing to the syndicate that would publish Matter of Fact. The previous day, in small type at the bottom of the front page, the Post had announced, Joseph Alsop and his brother Stewart begin their new column today on page 9.<br><br>For the Alsops, the Wisners, and the Grahams, it was the beginning of a long, tumultuous, and consequential friendship.</p><h2>Picasso's Vollard Suite (Painters &amp; Sculptors)</h2><p>The 100 etchings made by Picasso between 1930 and 1937 for the great art critic and dealer Ambroise Vollard have long been recognised as one of the supreme productions of the master&#39;s hand.

Boring this work isn't, as one would expect from a kid who grew up as the only Jew in a tough 1920s Italian South Philadelphia neighborhood, entered a college acting program to get away from his bookie and was cast by Garry Marshall in TV's <i>The Odd Couple</i> because Marshall had been impressed by seeing Klugman on Broadway in <i>Gypsy</i> getting spit on by Ethel Merman and not flinching. Although lacking in panache, the book does stay true to its stated intention of paying tribute to Randall, who founded the National Actors Theatre. The most endearing anecdote is that of how Randall cast Klugman in a 1991 benefit <i>Odd Couple</i> production, three years after Klugman had undergone throat cancer surgery and lost almost all his voice. The chapter titled "How Tony Gave My Life Back" recounts how Klugman retrained his throat and regained his career. Though amateurish, Klugman's writing possesses rare conviction and humility.

Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them the inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses.&nbsp;By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud created a transformation in our generation&#x2019;s thinking. <br><br><i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>&nbsp;is offered here in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years was the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology.
